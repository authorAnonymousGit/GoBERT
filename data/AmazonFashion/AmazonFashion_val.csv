77838,"Love it, but had to order a size up once I received the first one bc the sleeves were not long enough for my little guy.  He is in six month clothing and I thought with it being a two piece, we would be fine, but no.  Had to order in 9 months.",5
356069,"This was absolutely too large for the age that I bought it. My son wants to wear it, but it's too long and what bothers me the most is that the collar is tooooo large, which  means that he needs to wear first a t-shirt and then this blouse otherwise the neck almost up to the shoulders is completely uncovered. This is disproportionate, I try to hide it from my son cause I do not want him to wear it.",1
679437,"It ran a size smal, so I ordered up. But it still ran small in the waist and large in the  chest. I'm  5'7 tall 36D. It has odd shaped breast build-in padding, which I wouldn't have needed anyway. It made me look like I had big, wide hips.",2
847782,"This dress would probably be good looking on a taller person, but on my 5'2"", somewhat rounded frame, it was not flattering at all.

The dress also ran small - it was EXTREMELY tight on me.  And the fabric was somewhat unpleasant - very thick and synthetic feeling.  Seemed to be well made, however.

For the right person, this could be very attractive.  But it didn't work for me.",3
609157,"Fit perfectly... I am about 5'5"" and 115lbs, and the XS was perfect. A little loose in the waist, but it is fine with a belt and I like the slightly baggy/straight leg look. It originally came in the mail without a button, but I contacted the seller and they did not hesitate to send me a new pair. Great pants and great customer service! Will definitely be buying another pair in a different color.",5
500099,"Uh, my fault, but I hate Velcro on hats. The Velcro wears out. Whats Velcro? The adjustable strap on the back of the hat. However, with that being said, good quality hat nice embroidery, gone through the wash a couple times, nothing wrong with it. Except the Velcro... but again, my fault.",5
260196,"I'm 5'1 wear a size 8 or 9 in women's jeans and I ordered these jeans in a size 9. the fit is really stretchy and comfortable, quality is really good, but the bottoms could be a little smaller but other than that I love these jeans and seriously would consider buying this product again",4
76010,"The BellaBand is comfortable to wear and fits true to size, however you can clearly see if your pants are unbuttoned. I layered a tank top and then a sweater over it and it's not noticable now, but I was hoping that it would be a little more discrete that my pants were unzipped. That being said, it really does the job because I can continue to wear my work pants to work without having to buy $100 maternity pants that do not fit, so I'll most likely buy this in another color as well.",4
59324,"Sure, I didn't spend a lot of $ on this coat, but I was hoping for it to feel better than a plastic bag wrapped around my son. It's VERY thin and the plastic is very crinkly. It'll work for as frequent as I plan to use it, but I wouldn't recommend this product if you plan to wear it all the time. I can't imagine it holding up very well for a long.",3
842305,"My girlfriend loves this and gets compliments all the time!  She was confused about why it is for ""big girls"" and mentioned that she thought the name was creepy. She mentioned that the print is not something appropriate for girls, AKA, someone under the age of 21 (the legal age for most states that have legalized marijuana).  A pattern and the actual substance are different, obviously, but she wanted to mention it.",5
733868,This shirt is a nice color. The only thing I didn't like is that it has slits on both sides that I didn't know about. They go up quite high so I have to wear a tank top underneath which I was not expecting to have to do. I still do like it though and like the high low concept.,4
851769,"These sneakers fell apart after about 2 months of wearing. I understand that boys play hard, but I expect them to grow out of their shoes, not for the shoe to fall apart. The lining in the shoe started to rip within a couple weeks. I would not recommend these.",2
309284,I haven't worn this in the pool yet but I think it will suit my needs. I wanted good support for wearing under a swim shirt in my water aerobics class. Band around ribcage under the cups is a little large but the cup size and support were fine so I decided to keep it rather than exchanging for one size smaller.,4
418979,"The fit of the product is quite tight for an XS (I'm a 0-2p in size)...
and I've brought other shorts in the same size by other companies and
the fit was good...this XS is a little too small but I'm still able to wear them although a little tight...Still a good buy but I would buy the next size up the next time",4
801294,"Great dress for the price! I am 5'7"", 240 lbs 40DDD-36-47. I ordered an X-Large (black) and it hugs all of my curves the right way. However, if you have big breasts like myself, some fashion tape or pasties will do you right with this dress. Overall, I am a happy customer!",4
660112,I bought a pink pair in small and they were a tad too small.  Wearable but a little small.  I wanted more colors so I decided to buy my next pair in a medium.  WAY TOO BIG.  The sizing on these products are horrible.  The medium fit like an xtra large and the small was too tight.,1
212409,"These gloves look smart, they are comfortable and well make. They can also be worn while using a touchscreen with no problem. My hands are borderline between two sizes, I bought the smaller of the two and they might be just a tad small but definitely wearable. The gloves are warm enough for most of the weather here in Boston Ma. but there are days when I switch over to my mittens. The only reason I did not give these 5 stars is because I reserve that rating for items that are truly extraordinary.",4
792987,Not really meant for rounder or larger faces. I bought these because I thought they were slimmer and more extended outward like a cat eye but the lenses are a lot more rounded than Id like and the frames are tight on my face and the bridge doesn't hit on my nose at the right place throwing the whole look off..l Pass on these if you're not super tiny with a much smaller face than the average female.,2
218927,"My 9 years old daughter really wanted this necklace when I showed it to her on my phone. She said she wanted it and so I bought this for her. It was really cute and the pendant was slightly smaller than I would have expected. Overall, it's a really great necklace and the price was great!",5
61771,"Product shipped and arrived as expected.  Product is awesome! Fits perfect. Before, using this product I was I using the belly binder that I was given at the hospital which is good too but just a bit uncomfortable when it sits right below the breast.  The c- panty supports comfortably and it's easy to put on and off.  I don't feel as much pain when I get out of bed after nap. It holds my belly in place. Bottom line, I love it, I'm buying more and I totally recommend it for all c-section moms.",5
676176,"Very cute prints and soft. The one thing I do not like about these sleepers is that, while the feet for the 2T size do have treads, the base material is just regular cotton. My son wore holes in the feet of his last set of sleepers that had much thicker material there so I am not getting my hopes up that these will last. Will update this review with any findings.",4
41911,I purchased this product for my wife to replace one that was several years old and worn out.  She absolutely loves it.  It has more than enough room to carry all the things she needs when she goes out.  It is very supple for a leather purse with more than enough pockets.,5
178497,"This is a nice hat, as described but the packaging is questionable as the supplier put it in a bag. The visor could get crumpled. Mine thankfully came out ok. Also, I did not realize it was coming all the way from China. It arrived the day after I needed it for an event.",4
156126,"Good: Very nice, sleek, polished design.  I bought it as my leather wallet was falling apart and stuff inside growing too big.  It does let enough EMR for the door and elevator SeCard to work.
Bad: It does not have enough space for cash.  It is not wide enough for business cards. I cannot keep my bus pass inside it as that won't read through. When I tried to put dollars inside the extra pressure would pop it open.",5
91558,"These are nice swim shorts that fit well.  They are a little ""swingy"", but that's how I like them.  They have an inside panty, so they're perfect for a day at the beach or pool.  I ordered some tankini tops to wear with them and look forward to getting those to complete the set.",4
239907,"Comfortable, nice looking and strong. I lift weights and needed a 'stunt double' to take the place of my gold wedding band. This one fits the bill. One note: it runs just a little big. If your ring size falls in between their sizes, I would get the next smaller. My ring size is right between 9 & 9.5. I opted for the 9.5 to be safe. Had to return it for being a little too loose, and get the 9.",5
619162,"Love this. It's a little small. If your vet did a good job at the cremation, it shouldn't be too hard to get your pets ashes into it. Sadly, my vet sucked and I had to literally pick out bits and pieces just so I can get some ashes into my necklace. I was distraught having to do that.",3
691450,"The earrings picture do not do justice to how large the pearls actually are, in fact, the pearls are so large and unproportional that the earrings are top heavy. This causes the earrings to pull forward on one's ear, instead of pulling down.

I strongly recommend the seller include a picture of the earrings profile that demonstrates how oddly shaped these earrings are. The picture currently available is not representative of the delivered product.",2
630485,"My first thought was that these are chinzy pieces of ****, but I told myself to give them a chance because I know I'm a little prejudiced against fake jean leggings....
Guess what? First assertion correct. I put these puppies on and they were a little too stretched out but still wearable. Had nice length and were comfortable. THANK GOODNESS I looked at my ass in the mirror! Down both cheeks were in long stripes of see through fabric!
Pretty disappointed at the poor quality of these leggings.",1
669865,"Am I 5 years old??? I ordered a large, I am 5'5 115. This bathing suit stole my heart with its vibrant colors and graphics. When I pulled it out of the bag I knew I was doomed!!!!! When I ordered it I didn't expect much from the bottoms. I knew chances are my booty would spill out. BUT, the top and the bottoms were, like....no. Hahaha. Thats what I get to for trying to buy a bathing suit online. I have learned my lesson! But still. so cute if you're reeeeeeeeeeeally petite. Or if you are a child.",2
461527,I really like this bandanna. I use it to dress up as Rosie the Riveter for Veterans Day and anything to do with World War Two. This is a small scarf and not meant to go around your head to make a Rosie Turban. i wish it would though. It is so perfect.,4
21293,"I love iPlay hats and buy them for my kids every year. I bought the 9-18 month size for my 12 month old and it's perfect. It protects his face from the sun, and his neck. It ties under his chin and he can't get it off. The blue matches lots of stuff and is a great color. The hat can be worn while in the water too which is great! It dries quickly and does a great job protecting little ones from the sun.",5
390293,"After months of looking at different brands, websites, options, etc. I have finally found the perfect pair for me and at a great price point too! These are well made, cute, great feeling and real looking, especially with a shirt on. I purchased the a C/800g pair for less than $25.....not a single complain after a few weeks of use. I am very happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend these MaxTara Silicone Breast Full Forms, you will be happy you bought them. Thanks!",5
497336,I thought I ordered a nice perfect fitting shirt but I got a extra large & fits really loose. Its hard ordering your size online because of the different material. I'm planning on ordering again in a different style more like a top & see how that goes. But no matter what I still wear this shirt even if its big.,3
115315,"I am giving this only two stars because I ordered TWO pairs of these glasses and only received ONE. I was basically ripped off. I will change this review once I receive my other pair. On a more positive note, the sun glasses are nice and seem to be good quality. They are such a good price it makes you want to order more than one...better not though.",2
756986,"I do like the feel of the fabric, but this robe is in no way an XXL.  I can wrap it around myself, barely- but there is no extra room. Generally I wear a comfortable XXL, with spare room. Also, the sleeves are too tight, when pushing them up they go about 5"" above my waist then becom exceedingly tight and move no further. So, it has none of the comfy things I look for in a robe.",2
336825,This RFID waist wallet is very thin and discrete. This is good for going to concerts and events because you don't have to worry about getting pick pocketed. Since it is a RFID blocker you do not have to worry about people stealing you're credit card information. It fit all sizes and easy to take off. I received this product for free for my unbiased and honest review of this product.,5
276173,"I just got these glasses yesterday. They came really fast, which is always great. What i like the most about them is they are sturdy, so many sunglasses have lose screws and fall apart easily. They are great and have a very vibrate color. Plus they come with a case and cleaning cloth. Great product overall.",5
756288,"Loved the sweater when I tool it out of the package. When I tried the sweater on it was ""way ""to small.  Now I ordered an extra large (XL) and this sweater fits like a medium.  Internet shopping adds value to me by saving shopping at ""brick and mortar"" stores.  Purchasing and returning products because they do not adhere to standard sizes defeats this goal.  I'll just give it to someone and move on and delete this brand from future orders.",1
782865,"I bought this to wear at Zumba classes, and I love it.  I'm 5'3"" and about 133 lbs. I have wider hips so I bought a medium and it fits just as I wanted it to, a little loose but not too much to where I look like I'm trying to hide something. Looks cute too, which gives me that extra boost of confidence. I'm highly considering buying another color.",5
411340,"This evening bag is beautiful! The photo does not do it justice! It's well made, roomy for a small evening bag, the top clasp is a bow made out of rhinestones. I purchased the bronze which is a light color more like a champange. Just perfect for what I'm wearing. I'm very happy with this bag and would recommend it to anyone. It was delivered fast and I had no problems with this seller. I would buy from this company again and recommend that they display their handbags better to show their true beauty. I'm very happy with this purchase.",5
218388,"I like the material of this item, and the skirt fits perfectly. The blouse is too small, I'm a B cup and only weigh 125 and the medium is so small the buttons are stressed when I wear it.  The skirt has Velcro on the waist band so it can be made smaller or larger. So order larger.",3
559699,The cuff part is okay. The chain is shorter than other ones I've bought and I prefer a longer chain. The hoop earring is what gives this a 2 star rating - it's far too small to do anything with. I bent it the first time I took it apart to put it in my ear and now it won't go back to its original shape. The saving grace here is that the chain is not attached to the hoop and can be used with other earrings. Still not worth the price for the cuff and chain. Do not recommend.,2
615526,The material is soft and comfortable. It moves well with all your body movement. I use it for working out and I would also have like to use is to dress casually with shorts but the material is so soft it will all the body definitions include a flabby stomach. Maybe a size bigger may work.,5
156937,"I've been looking to buy a RFID blocking wallet for some time now, but was always turned off by the plastic hinges and ugly design. This wallet, however, is much more stylish, and looks much more durable than others I've seen. This wallet holds all my credit cards, IDs, and cash without any issue. It is very durable, and has a nice weight to it. I'm more than satisfied with this purchase!",5
777358,"These are nice looking and working shoes - for awhile. However, The soles are not sturdy at all. After only about a month and a half of regular use, the soles were splitting and by two months, they're almost unusable.

I love Tesla running shoes, but sadly these are not of the same quality and durability as those are.",3
825230,"It looked like a cute blazer with a very pretty lining, but the small was tight across the shoulders.  I'm 5/4"", way about 124 on a good day and usually wear a size 6.  More importantly the pockets are fake and I needed a blazer with pockets.  I wish they would have clarified that on the details.",2
37236,"Great hat for my son's first trip to the beach. We got the 18 month size, even though he was only 12 months, but it fit fine. I love the tie, and it didn't seem to bother him at all. The brim of the hat was easily flipped up, and held on even through a wave to the face.
Great hat. Would buy again when he needs a bigger one.",5
654245,"I was pretty disappointed...other tall reviewers said the length was acceptable, but it is unattractively short on me (I'm 5'10.5). The material is extremely cheap and made me think of a Halloween costume. Also, the cut is not the greatest, it just does nothing to accentuate my figure and adds a lot of bulk to my waist. I wish I hadn't purchased it. It wasn't too tight, but I ordered two sizes up from my usual as per the other reviewers.",2
451331,"First of all, it came in the mail broken. Probably more against the packaging and handling than the item, but the ring itself seems like a cheap and light metal alloy with some really small cheap sparkles. We ended up throwing away the ring part out of the mailer and kept the Batman to see what else we can make with it. I wouldn't think this is worth more than $1, but seems more appropriate if it would come out of a bubble gum machine. I've actually seen better quality out of a 50 cent machine at the grocery store.",2
456505,My son wore this as a ring  bearer at my cousins wedding he was so cute and matched the groom exactly! One thing I did not know though is it is dry clean only we did not realize that and try to iron it which caused it to dapple a little but it still looked good the tie was very convenient and did not bother his neck at all,4
136690,You get what you pay for.  I opened the package and a button was missing from the bikini bottoms.  The top is really small and very padded.  There are no return instructions or options that I've seen.  Just pay a little more money for a better quality product!,1
882935,"It looks just like the picture and fits well. Its not too heavy or too thin, nice woven fabric.
  I am pleased that it is Fair Trade from Nepal and anticipate wearing this for a long time.
Having a fondness for Koi and a need to be Fearless, this hat really caught my attention. Very happy with it.",5
359421,These socks are AWESOME! They fit me very well and stay on throughout my entire 12 hour shift as a nurse. They have lasted well too. I love that they have cats on them. So worth it. They're the only compression socks that I have found that stay up during my shifts.,5
297410,"I bought 2 of these by mistake.  When I was rinsing one off the stone in the center fell off into the floor.  The stones were not fastened down good.  They are actually more beautiful than depicted, but I was very disappointed that the stones were not anchored properly.  I was going to give one to my sister with her other ring but they are no good as is.",2
295617,"I ordered a cheaper one in the past, and it broke so that's why I had to purchase these.
Right from opening the package, I can tell you that these look much higher quality and I'm certain that they will not break for a long time. The cords are thick and smooth and I can pair these with any outfit to add some extra detail. No complaints here.",5
394085,"Purchased this as a bday gift for my boyfriend. He loved it , the XL fit perfectly and the shirt looks just like the picture. I will also mention that I bought him the L first but it was too small and I had to return it. Even though the seller does not offer an exchange for items that don't fit as expected, they made the return process easy and processed the return quickly.",5
413437,"This wedding ring was purchased for me. I loved what I saw in the pictures and had them ordered for me. The diamonds are so tiny that it feels like there's nothing there. It doesn't sparkle, it's very very dull. I wish i got them much earlier before my wedding, I would have returned them.
The stone seems to sit well in the picture but it doesn't.
Design looks great in pictures but not in real life. Very displeased with the purchase.",2
165606,"These are amazing, top-notch quality, and a beautiful magenta.  Sadly, they are way too big.  90 degrees: PLEASE make XXS!!!  For reference, I am 5""1 and 85 lbs (slim/athletic) and these were loose on the thighs and crotch, making them unflattering. Totally recommend these for anyone looking for high quality workout clothes without the fluff branding.",5
777920,"When you read the comments recommending to order a size up, do it.  I'm almost always a medium but based on reviews I ordered a Large and it's still a bit snug.  It's not you, it's the manufacturer. :)

The back is quite attractive and it will hold the girls in place while working out.",4
286633,"Introuvable en France, j'ai reu ma commande en 4 jours, merci Amazon. Le chargeur est efficace sur des Citizen et Casio G Shock. Il m'a permis de recharger des montres solaires que je n'arrivais plus  charger correctement au soleil. Le chargeur ne chauffe pas, les montres non plus. Pour le moment, je suis content.",5
482680,"Not a bad looking dress. I thought the material would of looked a bit different than how it looks in the pic. But no complaints. It's a bit snugged but wearable and workable. Reading the other reviews I went down a size so I order an 8, but it still doesn't cause an issue. It's cute and short and fits my curves just right.",4
407765,"The disadvantages of this sleep sack are it bunches up in the back (needs a few stitches to tack the facing to the body of the sleep sack) and the zipper is huge and it bunches up under the baby's chin.  This product is definately not for the 3-6 month baby, as advertized.  On the plus side, it is heavy fleece, therefore warm, and has a fair amount of adjustability.",3
337883,The product is excellent it fits as expect however I have huge thighs so if you also have huge thighs it's kinda tight but I got it on like the champ I am. It lifts your butt and sucks uour tummy in the hold is really good I was pleasantly surprised,5
175455,"I'm 5'5, 135lbs and a 36d bra. I ordered an XL due to other reviews and I probably should've ordered and XXL or a 3xl! My boobs don't for in the top at all, the top fits my friend who wears a 36B. The bottoms are too snug on my curvy hips, the XL really fits like an American Medium.",3
860266,"Looks great in thr picture but once got it is sooo much different, The texture of the fabric is like paper , cheap material and is so thin that it don't have a second piece of fabric under the dress, Its way too small in the bag that i couldn't believe that the was a dress.",1
28874,"I use these for exercising in the gym and it took a few outings for my feet to adjust because of the pronounced support in the arches. Be forewarned - these are not ""cheap insoles"" but professional orthotic inserts; I have a history of plantar factitious and recommend purchase only if you need the appropriate support. These are very well made, structurally sound, comfortable, and effective although not necessarily ""right"" for everyone.",5
855013,I just got it in. It's a good belt. It's definitely white not an off-white or dingy white. The buckle worked and it stretches as expected. It does take a while to get in because it comes from China but it's totally worth it for the price & the quality is good. No complaints. :),5
737813,"I'm 5'8 and about 165 lbs., and I usually wear a medium, but I ordered a large for the length of my arms. It does fit my arms and it is a little big, but still quite cute. The ruffles do not go all the way down to the bottom of the top as depicted in the photo. The ruffles are about 1/3 long on the top and the fabric is cotton-like. Nonetheless, it's a solid purchase.",4
27849,"I really enjoy walking and hiking but suffer from extremely weak arches, arthritis in both first metatarsals, and sciatica. Good arch support is essential for a proper stride and to distribute my foot properly. These inserts seem to remedy the first two problems, and help with the third. They are quite firm, and I wouldn't mind a bit softer feel, but the overall support is excellent. I haven't used them for long, and I'll see if they bump up to five stars in a future review.",4
264818,"Nice dress fits like a glove, one small issue for not getting a 5 star is that the breast area tore a little bit for me , I think the stitches were torn already when it shipped, a simple fix by taking it to the cleaners, but other than that it is a great dress and fits phenomenally",4
409111,I just received this ring yesterday and opened it today. The box was nice and simple designed. I noticed that I looked like the person who packed the ring must have been eating chocolate because there was some type of chocolate candy ( sniffed it lol) on the box. No problem though. The ring inside was even more beautiful in person! I love it and I cannot wait to give this to my husband.,5
500491,"I'm 5'6'' and this dress was definitely shorts than in the picture (it's not ankle length, but about 6 inches above the ankle). I looks beautiful, but doesn't flow out as much as in the picture, and the cream part is more beige. I like this dress, but the belt is inconvenient (it always unclips and falls off at the most random and awkward moments) and not the perfect compliment to the dress. It's a nice dress. Pretty, but not quite as elegant as in the picture.",4
194283,I love this top but it is too small for me. I ordered another in a size bigger and one was sent in the same size so I have 2 that are too small (sleeves are not loose enough) Thankfully the top looks great on my 14yr old daughter and she loves it!,4
424028,"I was mainly interested in finding an 18"" chain for other pendants and in looking at the reviews this seemed to have the chain I was looking for and the pendant was a nice one to boot.  The chain is sturdy, easy to open and strong. The pendant's red color is very handsome.  I am pleased with this purchase and feel it is well priced and a good value for the money.",5
830458,"I brought the yellow purse. And, my yellow purse arrived with several black spots that can't be removed because it look as though the leather was burned. My very first bad experience on Amazon. I had to waited for the purse to be imported from out off the country. I purchased 'a rejected purse'. No one in quality control should've sent this 'rejected purse/ leather' to the United States. I will never buy from this maker again.",1
110654,"Cute fashion piece.  Gave to one of my daughters and she loves it.  Has held up nicely.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it's BRIGHT YELLOW.  On my screen it appears cream colored or neutral.  Not sure if I missed that in details or it doesn't state.  However, I'm still happy an so is my daughter as it's a cute piece.",4
207616,"I'm 4'11"", 95lb. This is basically a pair of tights with denim and pockets printed on it. It doesn't function like a real pair of jeans of course. It's thin material, but not thin enough to show the color of my underwear. I find it comfortable. It accentuates my butt. Fits great!",5
94399,"Cute earrings for the price.  If the light hits them just right, the cubes sparkle.  The pearl dangles freely, which is good.  The only down side is that the ""gold"" has a pinkish tone and, in my opinion, could never pass as real gold.  For those who are wondering, they are just short of an inch long (7/8""), and the round top part is 3/8"" across.  I have not worn them yet, so I can't speak to whether or not they irritate my ears.",4
333963,"I love the jacket, but it does not run true to size.  I debated about sending it back, but was afraid the large might not fit properly. I usually wear a small for my 5' 61/2"" and 126 pound frame.  I am so glad I ordered a medium.  If your hips are anything but tiny order two sizes up.  It fits tight in the bust area and hips.",4
311721,My daughter has worn these shoes everyday for a month.  They already have holes in the front and the design/sparkles are worn off on the velcro part.  She is very hard on shoes but I thought they would at least look presentable for a couple months.  They do not.,1
144745,"I bought this for my 12 year old daughter, unsure weather it would be anything she might wear.  She tends to wear jewelry once or twice and forget it so I'm not going to spend much.  She loved it and wore it all through the holiday season and although I haven't seen it in a few days, it's probably at the  bottom of her purse waiting to be rediscovered",5
868697,I bought a pair of these exact same design tabi socks for $1.50/pair at my local Daiso store here in Texas. I have size 6-6.5 US women feet and they fit well. I can slip into flip flops no problem. It was weird at first because the sewed edge on the bigger toe grouping leaves the pinky toe to hang out by itself. I assumed it was intended in the design.,4
399978,"These earrings look nicer, higher quality, in the picture than in real life.  One of the pieces that goes through the ear (sorry, not educated in earring terminology), was a little bent.  I started to try to straighten it but decided I was more likely to break it off, so left it alone.  In all, you get what you pay for, and I've yet to see my girlfriend wear them.",3
240728,This is now my husbands wedding band.  He needed a sturdy sliver colored band that wouldn't bend or break on him.  It's a beautiful shiny band which impressed me so much I decided I would get one for me to wear on my thumb:)  He had this band for about 4 months already and it still looks brand new and super shiny.,5
804993,"Overall it was very cute, they do run small. I wear a 7-9 and I got an xl to be on the safe size and it worked out pretty good. I will say this this top works great for girls who have bigger breasts. I don't have much in the breast area so that is the only downfall from my end.",4
32910,"I'm really, really happy with these.  I've never been a big flip-flop girl but these are super comfortable.  They don't rub between my toes and the foot base is nice and squishy.  Love the color.  I'm an 8.5/9 and these fit perfectly.  I'll get another color next year, and maybe a pair for my son.  Love 'em!",5
187623,"Fits me perfectly. I'm 5'6"" and 135 lbs and it fits me just great. Although it is a bit short on me, as it only reaches down to my upper thigh. Taller girls might need to beware. The quality of the material is a bit questionable, as it seems rather thin. Although it isn't see through while wearing and its lightweightness is very comfortable to me. So regardless, I'm very pleased with this item. :)",5
462115,Good thing I went with the medium!! Normally I would order a small but thanks to previous reviews I went with the medium. Being 4'10 this dress met about slightly over halfway my thigh. Also about 36 at the chest so it was a perfect fit. This dress was true to color and cut. Just be prepared when walking it will ride up.,5
190334,"The fabric is thin and see-through.  The sewing is terrible.  I'd say it looks like I did it myself, but I think that would be doing myself a disservice.  The stripes don't match up, as they're angled - not horizontal as portrayed, but I think that's more of a ""couldn't give a crap about sewing this straight"" job. The dress is stretchy, so I really don't see the point of it having a zipper either.  It's just another way to make the dress look wonky.",2
632837,"Superb shirt.  Alice in Wonderland is one of the most endearing children's stories of all time.  This T-shirt epitomizes the very best of Alice.  Superb quality T-shirt, and excellent images make this shirt a pleasure to wear.  Many people smile or comment favourably when I am wearing it.  T-shirt arrived ahead of time, securely packed.  Everything was as promised.  Well done Cafe Press.  Highly recommend.  Want to get the T-shirt (red lettering) for Through the Looking Glass!",5
410143,"My wife bought this ring as a wedding band replacement she loves it..... (MRS)it could be a tad thicker it slips under my engagement ring alot and the sizing a little off it runs small, but for what its for i'm in love with it. My engagement ring has a weird shape to it that has been hard to find something to fit it. But this is a good ring.... i hope it last for a while :D",4
378028,"I like this top. The fabric is nice, and matches the picture. It is a bit tight on me. I normally wear a medium or large. I bought the xlarge. I think with 5 lbs loss it will fit me. It does run small, but these are Asian sizes, which differ from USA sizes. The top I received was very well made and is quite cute!",4
785327,"Case looks good, really slim and easy to put on and take off. Haven't tested it for water, I doubt it will pass...but it's ok I mainly wanted a case that is fully closed for sand, dust and can keep dry around water.
The front plastic cover is loose and it is really annoying when you use the touchpad.
I returned it but seller offered a new one.
I hope that would be more snug on the front!",2
811565,Wow what can I say other than this bracelet is a thing of beauty.  I get complements on this all of the time.  The bracelet feels good and the construction and materials used you can feel the quality.  Looks just like the picture.  Recommended for anyone that wants to add a flair to their wardrobe.,5
178948,This hat is so adorable and it fit my daughter (2 1/2 yrs old) great. It is perfect for the beach and does well in the water. It has sun protection which is a plus. The chin strap actually fits and it's not too tight like other hats I have purchased.,5
399801,"This Mountainsmith Bike Cube is a great bag.  I bought it because I needed a bag that was designed to carry a bike/skate helmet.  This bag more than filled the requirement and actually allows me to store and carry 2 large helmets plus lots of other gear and a change of clothes (t-shirt, shorts, etc.).  The price is reasonable too.  I would recommend it to others.",5
88180,"As others have said, these do make things darker than normal sunglasses, but you can still easily see when looking through them. They are decent quality, but you can't expect perfection when you get a 3 pack for $6 (I purchased them 2 years ago and 2 of the 3 pairs are still going strong). They are also fairly comfortable. Can easily bend the frames without breaking if they get uneven. Good bargain.",4
360444,It's not exactly like the picture but still gorgeous I'm 5'6 and weigh 200 and got a large and fits perfectly I have a big boobs and a big butt and it fit amazing I'm 200 pounds but don't look it so it depends on ur body for the size,5
733020,"LOVE it ! So CUTE !!  It did shrunk a little ,So I ordered a an Xlarge for my son for his birthday and keep the large for me . It's adorable shirt . But I am going to make sure it's Preshrunk from now on or get a size bigger .",5
380555,"I wore these at Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe...I thought they would keep me dry. Nope. I was soaking wet. For what the reviews said, I thought I would be fine wearing them. I was soaked through! I was very disappointed with them. They fit ok, but if it says they are waterproof, they should be.",2
637827,"I read the reviews that said it ran a little big. I am 5'5"" and 160 and a medium fit me perfectly. I love how i actually feel pretty in this versus traditional nursing nightgowns. I ordered the pink and blue and it is so pretty. I just wish they weren't so expensive so i could buy a couple.",5
89321,"These are great for everyday. I don't like to change my earrings often and these are comfortable while sleeping and talking on the phone. They are not cheaply made like some of the reviews I read said some of these were. I recommend them! They are small, about 1/4 inch smaller than a dime. I have small ear lobes so they work great, I had some that were 16mm, but they were too big, (about the size of a dime). These are a much better fit. LOVE THEM!",5
492895,Perfect condition when arrived.  Very happy with this.  The color is slightly different than viewed on the computer screen.  More of a magenta than deep purple as pictured.  Still will work just fine for what it's needed for.  Arrived packaged very securely and properly to ensure it wasn't flattened in the mail.  Very satisfied with this and looking forward to using it in a costume of Effie Trinket soon.,5
527519,I had mine tailored before it was shipped. I love the gown but I was disappointed that the embellishments were not as in the pictures. I was able to communicate with the seller and she will be sending me additional embellishments. This gown is going to be my wedding gown. It is stunning and I've had many compliment on it. I would have given it a 5 star if it didn't lack on the embellishments. I do give 5 star for the seller DressyStar.,3
806558,"This is very long and extremely heavy, but I chose to cut it about halfway off and now its perfect. It looks enough like my real hair that its not super obvious thats its not real. It doesnt look like doll hair, like others I have purchased. I highly recommend.",5
500648,"Beautiful swimsuit, but not true to size. Fits more like a size medium instead XL. Gave to my daughter-in-law, and she tried and we both had a big laugh at the fit of this swimsuit, she wears size medium and large, only way she could wear this is if she had the body of a 10 year old, short and flat chested.",1
437371,It was hard for me to fit the set of keys and hard to get the keys in and out of case. I have 7 keys of various sizes on my key ring including a car key fob. The grommet on the top of the case where the key belt connector is attached came loose after a couple weeks of use. If you only have a few keys on your ring and you need to protect your clothing from your keys this may work for you. Quality is OK. I wouldn't purchase again though.,2
632620,"When I pulled it out of the package I thought,  no way!  It fit amazingly well.  It had jaw dropping results!  The only thing I was a bit down hearted about is that the shoulders tie.  But in the end, just made it easier to slip out of.  I am a size US 10.  So, I am not tiny, but I guess close to average.  It was soft , but softer after washing and even silkier.",5
260746,"This is a beautiful pendant.  The colors, in person, are as vivid as the product image.  The chain is the weight of inexpensive costume jewelry, but is sturdy and bright.  Although I purchased it as the centerpiece of bedroom mirror decor for spiritual reasons, I'd have few concerns about the necklace breaking with repeated wear.",5
692717,"Way too small. I got the biggest size, but it still didn't fit around my boobs. I wear a 36DD, so this is always a challenge.

Also, the material was crepey.... sort of like that stuff older ladies' suit trousers might be made of. Even if it had fit, I don't think I would have wanted to wear this out in public. I sent it back.",1
56650,"My only regret is that I didn't order 2 or 3 in the first place.

When you get into your third trimester, wearing pants is a special occasion (at least for me). I want all skirts and dresses all the time, but I don't like my thighs rubbing together. Problem solved! These are so comfortable-- they smooth things out and keep them in place, but aren't constricting or tight on the belly. Order a pair (or three) now, you'll be glad you did!",5
336398,"I love it. I have a 5 month old son and when I don't feel like carrying a heavy diaper bag around I slip a few diapers and some wipes in my purse and I'm good to go! It fits his diapers, wipes, my phone, my wallet, keys, and more. I'm so glad I chose this to be my purse :)",5
651450,"Love it! Bought it for my husband to wear during deployment so he could leave his real ring at home, and I think this is the one he'll wear even after he returns. He likes this one so much more. He often complained about the weight of his wedding ring, and the discomfort. This is lightweight, but still visually appealing. Plus, for the price, it doesn't matter if he loses it during a deployment or in the field, and we can keep the ring with sentimental value safe at home.",5
43936,"I bought this as a gift for Xmas for my wife. In fact, I bought her the same umbrella two years ago, but she lost it. She loves it. It's sturdy, reliable and best of all, classy looking. It protects her hair from the rain and wind. She's received many compliments. It's better than your standard umbrella because she can see through the clear plastic while protecting more of your body and clothing from the bad weather. Great product...",5
623932,This shirt is loose fitting and a little larger than expected. The quality is equivalent to similar priced tops from Kohls but I didn't have to pay a shipping fee which makes it kind of less expensive than ordering just one shirt from Kohl's who didn't offer a brown shirt.,5
733784,"These are cheaply made. I loved them at first, until the seam that is on the inner surface rubbed my ear to the point of it being raw and bleeding (I had only had them in for two days!). The outer rims are huge, making it more difficult to get in and out of the ear.",1
514736,"It's a little big on my daughter. She's 5'2"" and 120 lbs. The waist is slightly loose and it's a bit long. But she just pulled it up high. Other than that it's comfortable and it looks great! The lining inside makes it not itchy. We would reccomend this product (I might even get one for me!).",5
608252,"The sizing is accurate (unlike most plus size costumes). I got this because I host a Halloween party every year and I need something non-bulky where I can move easily around the kitchen prepping food and drinks, slip in and about my guests without knocking them over and look fabulous. This is the perfect hostess costume!!",5
648288,"I was excited to find a cool contemorary wedding band like this one. The band is thin and dainty, but incredibly strong. I was worried the tension setting holding the stone wouldn't last, but I've worn it daily since I received it and it hasn't budged. Highly recommend this if you're looking for a cool unique ring! I received this ring at a discou,ted price in exchange for an honest review.",5
329564,"These were so cheap I was skeptical they would work out, but I got lucky and these turned out to be amazing.  They're nice and stretchy, but the pockets are such that I can wear these to work and look professional.  I wish they came in more colors!",5
852524,"I loved everything about these pants-the fabric, the style, the quality-but the waist elastic was so tight I couldn't breathe. No way I could wear them, unfortunately. The rest of the garment fit fine and draped nicely for a very flattering look. I read the other reviews about the fit and measured my waist to be sure I ordered the right size. I am 5'4"", 166 lbs. and pear-shaped. I would have just replaced the elastic with a longer piece but it was securely sewn in with several lines of stitching, too big a project!",3
277014,"I purchased my Wear Me Pro Eyewear sunglasses here on Amazon. They arrived really quickly. They come in a little soft case. They look great on me. I think they are pretty well-made. They work great while out in the sun, driving, etc. I love them. I received my pair of sunglasses for free as part of a promotion from the brand to try out and then give my honest opinion/review of them here and I really like these sunglasses.",5
107081,"My daughter has two cats that sleep with her and she always tells me about how and in which manner they snuggle up to her. Well, all of the positions the shirt shows are the exact ways they sleep, so when she received this as  gift she loved it, it made her laugh and she said
"" they nailed it "" !!!",5
275197,"A bit of assembly required at the start, but if done right it assures an accurate fit.  Belt and hardware are of good quality at a fair price.  It comes in a lovely box, and it would make a wonderful gift.  I would recommend this item to others.",5
858412,"Fit just like the picture shows! Very nice quality . Really stays put while in the water too. I would normally have gotton a medium but I read the sizing and got an extra large .
Make sure you order according to directive.
I am 5ft 3inches and 135lbs and their extra large fits perfectly.",5
694618,"My wife is mostly of Irish descent and happens to have been born on St. Patrick's Day. So... I'm always buying her stuff like this. The size is perfect for an adult who wants some bling without being overpowering. I certainly wouldn't want them bigger. But, the size is fine. You would think this cheep jewelry would look like costume jewelry. Nope! They look great and you can feel free to lose them!",5
699790,"Super cute. Very reasonable price. It is a cardboard with a felted finish material, but you wouldnt know it once you have it on. I prefer fascinators, so I just clipped this to a headband with the little hair ridges on it and it didn't budge a smidgen and I wore it out dancing to a punk band! I got lots of compliments! Went back to the vender and bought another one in black!",5
87636,"Beautiful ""long shirt"". I never wear allegra K dresses as a dress because they are too short (and I'm 5'4). I always pair this with leggings or skinny jeans underneath. Also this came with the cutest belt (so for that alone its worth buying this dress). I wash it delicates, no softener, and then hang it to dry. This is one of Allegra K's nicer dresses (and I own like 15 of them now lol)",5
286344,"This is a super cute necklace and the quality is pretty good.  The problem is, unless you stay still all day, the bird portion of the necklace moves and most of the time, the bird i up with the leaves so you can't even see what it is.  If it stayed in place with the bird about an inch from the leaves, it would be perfect.",3
37864,"If you ever watched family matters and thought that urkle was fashion foreward, these are the trousers for you. I instally felt like a mid 40s single lady with no kids, which I thought would be glorious, but in fact it was quite lame. Alson no pockets, which is the main reason I want to light these pantaloons on fire.",1
435825,"I love it. Size is good, it is a little bigger I wear S but here the size is S/M, but it is Ok. Also it is not short, I would like it to be shorter. I am very satisfied with the service shipping was very very fast. I am very happy with my purchase",5
741052,These shirts coming from China are NOT true to size. I was chosen to receive this product at a discount for my honest review. The sizes that come fit more of a youth/juniors Audience rather that adult sizes. You would have to be an X-small adult to fit into the XL shirt!!,1
206142,"Looks are very nice and fit good, except my girlfriend said they're a little uncomfortable in the creases of her leg and crotch, and there is a tear or rip under the waist band. Not sure if that's how they came or what happened but she is very gentle with things so that's my only concern.",4
805805,"Loved the costume I wore it to comic con however, usually I wear a medium but it seemed rather large particularly in the stomach area there was quite a bit of extra material that looked pretty bad so I ended up having to wear a corset over the outfit to hide the excess bunched up material and that worked out pretty well. I would recommend this outfit I got many compliments on it!",4
629206,It's nice to wear with a jacket or sweater runs a little small.  I wear a medium to large I bought an xlarge it fit well.  I'm glad I looked at the size chart first. The front is not as see through as the back so you could get away without a tank if you're wearing a jacket.  If not just throw a white tank and it will be fine.,4
4455,I got mine and love the color and plushness of the fabric.  This is a very thick robe!  Problem:  way too big.  I ordered an XL because I wanted it to be big so I would wrap it way around my body and have lots of room for lounging.  I had to send it back because it was just too big.  I will be getting a smaller size of the same product.  I am interested in seeing how it washes... not sure about that yet.,4
343557,"So this wouldn't be my first choice regularly however being large and pregnant I lowered my expectations and just went for a reasonably priced bathing suit. So at 6 months pregnant this fit me well, its pretty comfortable the only thing that's a down side for me is the chest area is a little droopy and doesn't have the best support and makes me feel a little exposed. But all in all I'm happy with my purchase.",4
802621,"The adjustment clasps at the bottom of the stirrup have sharp pins that jab you in the shin. I wouldn't recommend these as the way the loop and clasp are designed, the adjustment clasp is turned so that the sharp end is pointing towards your leg, not to the sides. I recommend the Shirt Stays that either attach to your sock, thigh, or are like this but without the clasp.",2
754853,"Very thin material, and one side of the dresses seam was not stitched along the seam, so there was a noticeable gap on the side of the dress. It almost looks as if it is coming apart. I will have a seamstress fix it, but the quality of the dress was very poor.",3
714001,Absolutely in love with these! I ordered three different patterns and pleased with the looks of them! The material is super soft and light weight. They wash well and are true to size. My daughter is four months and the 3-6 m is slightly big for her but she is on the small side. I am so bummed they are no longer available in her size!  My absolute favorite outfits!,5
284218,"If I had that models shape I would look stunning in it. But I am a petite small (5'3, 110 lbs), so it fits the best that it can. I ordered the small. It's a little short for a dress (if like me, you are older than 25, and do not have Heidi Klum's legs), but will pair well with leggings and flats or boots. The color is true as shown, very pretty blue.",4
227938,"The top fits perfectly snug, the stocking are black and that surprised my but it is that way in the picture. The skirt was way to small. We felt like we got a large top and a small skirt. I contacted the seller and he didn't have any larger sizes but did offer a refund. Shipped fast and as shown, still having fun with it but if you have wide hips the skirt may not fit.",4
108815,"Three sets of sterling silver 'happy backs' - which I had nver tried, not heard of before.  They seem to be working well.  They prop up my clunky weightier earrings and don't cause any skin irritation.  They arrived quickly and as expected.  I just think they were a bit pricey for what you get.

-m",4
588066,"I now understand why the price was so very low for this item.  My daughter only wore this one time and the links are breaking.  Also, it warns you that the color may be different...it is VERY different.  Not pearly, but a dull yellow.  The bracelet we received was also tarnished when it arrived.  Even at the low price, this bracelet is not worth it.",2
222116,"My husband tried these pants and he said they were comfortable. He was able to stretch in them and sit without them riding up. No digging into his belly either. Yet he said the pockets where short and not deep enough, especially the back pocket. He would barely fit his wallet. Also the pockets on the right side were short too but the one on the left was nice because it did have a flap to hold any items he put in the pocket in place.",4
165482,"Wow I love these pants! They are a nice, thick (not too thick, but substantial) material with a good amount of elasticity so they fit well and are super comfy. I bought them for the gym but wore them to work under a tunic because I couldn't wait to wear them. The material is thick and not at all see-through. I haven't washed them yet, so I can't say if they'll pill, but right now I'm very happy with them - I ordered two more pair...",5
248846,"I got the multicolor in XL I usually wear. Medium but wanted a loose fit. I'm 5' 3"" 124# 34DD I love it.
The only thing I didn't like was that the back is super long but that's my fault, I didn't see the picture of the model showing the back side till just now.",5
384762,"They look nice. They don't have typical clip that you can open and ""clip"" your tie to your shirt. The design on line looks like they slide over your tie and shirt. Which seems like a cool design until you they arrive and you try it on. The clips are so tight that there is no way a tie or a shirt can fit in between them. Cool idea, horrible execution. DO NOT BUY THESE CLIPS IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON USING THEM.",1
86611,"It fits just as you would expect. But it's a little see through and the lacy part on the back isn't connected at the bottom so it looks like it's falling off but that's how it's supposed to be. I'm wearing it to an adult convention though so it isn't a problem for me, just not everyday wear.",4
397389,"I bought these dolls (all 4) for my girls and they really enjoy them.  They are well made, the hair doesn't tangle like some of the less expensive Barbie dolls.  The clothes are stylish/detailed/current.  The heart shaped case that the dolls come in can be used to carry dolls around/store pieces.  My daughter (age 5) loves the charm bracelet that comes with the dolls. Each outfit also comes with 2 charms that fit on the bracelet.  This was money well spent.  Quality dolls. I hope there are more to come.",5

868969,"These are NOT women's sizes, they are Misses sizes so they run small!  I ordered an XL and it was too tight.  These should be advertised on Amazon as Misses sizes so larger older women understand that they are a different size category.  That said they are gorgeous and nicely made.",3
589341,I love this purse!  You have to realize it's all leather thus a little heavy.  The wallet is very cute but is not leather and red pieces began flaking off day 1.  I didn't buy it for the wallet but still a little disappointing.  For the price a great deal.,3
123370,"Perfect size for our two-yr-old and so, so cute! She is able to fill it with a few small items and then put it over her shoulder to carry around. It's perfect and she loves it. Quality is also good and I am pretty sure I won't find it in pieces around the house! Thank you for providing a design that is not so pink I want to puke. It's perfectly girly without being obnoxious.",4
180265,"Very pleased with this shirt. It's not as ""slim fit"" in the mid-section as I expected, but it's not baggy at all, and I decided I like the cut very much. Material isn't too thin or too heavy. Color (ruby) and style are as shown. Sleeves are snug but not too much so. Collar is great. I liked it enough to order a second shirt.",5
354713,Opened the package and I could smell it. Left it laying out thinking that it would air out. Only thing it did was stink up my kitchen. So now I put it in my garage and it now reeks out there. Of course I cant touch it much either because it makes my hands smell. I cant say anything about the quality cause I cant stand the smell.,1
283270,So I just received this bathing suit today and I definitely went a size up and got a XXL because of previous reviews that I saw. Im 54 and weight about 155. The bathing suit fits perfect and its so cute! I cannot wait to take this on my trip! Pictures coming soon!!,5
559291,"I love the dress!! I ordered 3 (sailor moon, mars and mini moon) the sailor moon dress came damaged and the seeker offered to send me a new one! each dress fit perfectly and we range from an Extra Small to a Large! I will totally buy from here again!! I love my dress so much!!!",5
445600,"I really liked the shoes.

Pros:
- fit as expected (I have chubby fit, and its laces permits that you tighten them up well)
- comfortable

Cons:
- My purpose was to use them to run at the beach, like wetting them and everything. Turns out that the really hurted my feet after a 30m running and passing by the water while running...it looked pretty bad after and very sore too.",3
88474,It is what you expect to get for the price. I used it for Halloween and received lots of compliments. As other reviewers mentioned it does run large. I had to whip out the sewing machine to take in the waist. And the gloves were oddly small. Other than that I was pleased.,4
198290,"The product is great itself. No padding for the top piece. I wouldn't recommend this bathing suit for 32A to 34A women. It's a good quality of fabric and very vibrant clean colors. I bought the black and neon green one. The only bad thing was it took forever to ship. It took them a week to actually ship my item and another two weeks to get here. Overall, I would recommend this bathing suit to others, just a person with patience.",4
594337,"These gloves are so cute, they're probably the most stylish gloves I own. However they are very difficult to get on, since they're super tight, and they're pretty much impossible to get on if your hands are wet. The interior is super soft, and the touchscreen capability is spot on. I just wish they were slightly bigger.",3

432207,"I know that this review is for the item but the most annoying thing about it was the shipping! 3 weeks...common...
second: the item is just regular quality, nothing special.
third: the curve on the top of the kippah is for a small head, although the kippah is in good size, once you wear it, it bubbles up in the center and doesn't fit nicely. it might change with time but for now. not very happy.",3
36564,The umbrella was decent quality but the time it took to receive it was absurd!  I even paid for fast shipping. I was very disappointed because I ended up having to go buy a new one so I could give it as a gift on time. So now this umbrella is just sitting at my house!,2
282808,"This jacket runs very small, as well as being poorly cut.  The material was a cheap, stretchy spandex blend, but don't think this jacket has any room for things like reaching your arms above your head, or across your body, or at all, really. The lining was reminiscent of the polyester lining you'd find in mid-century clothing--stiff and will rip at the slightest tug, as it has ZERO give.  It was returned immediately.",1
139985,I don't know how well it will stick through my night next weekend but I took it out and loved how it covered me perfectly! It's good quality and I love the smooth finnish. I've seen sticky bras with the weird lines in it I did not like that. I'm a C cup and hopefully it sticks through my night under my halter dress.,4
528216,"So im 5'3.5"" tall. I'm normally a medium so i got a large. Which fits great. Iv gotten alot of compliments so far. Its not as long as i hoped it hits me like 6"" above my ankle. I want to get another color because its so cute i think I'll do an XL for the extra baggy fit.",5
830605,"If I had known this garment shipped from China I never would have ordered it. Obviously, it was going to be too small even though I ordered an X-LGE. Couldn't ship it back for obvious reasons. A complete blow-out!!! The only reason I gave it one star is cuz I still loved the style and look of the garment.",1
126423,"Material fairly good. Waist band isn't too stretch able making it hard to get in and out. Belt was folded up because of packaging. Size medium and it fit comfortably on me but a little loose. I'm 5'3 and it was at my knees. My waist is 26inches btw. Also came on time. Exactly like picture except bottom is less flowy, ragged look like it was just folded (obviously).",4
237382,I had to order this because I'm a huge Harry Potter fan. I wear it all the time. I gave it 3 stars because the quality really isn't great and I have to keep fixing it (the links seperate fairly often). But for the price you can't expect much more and certainly can't beat it! I'm happy with the purchase.,3
4205,"I needed a flapper dress ASAP for an unexpected show I had to perform in, ordered it probably like four days before and got it within two days. Ended up fitting perfectly and won me *Best Costume*. Although if you are planning on getting this, I would recommend either getting or making your own head band because, the measly thing I got with the dress was just a sequinny elastic headband and one tiny bent feather. I made my own headband and it looked top notch.",4
405627,This is a beautiful devotion to St. Michael and all the choir of angels.  Looks like a Rosary but has the St. Michael medal at the beginning.

652210,"For starters I'm 5""8 180 and I wear a 36d size m shirts and 10 pants . I ordered the XXL US 12-14 Option and it fits amazing. The XXL is more like a M-L in real life. If you are D the breast area will be a little small but it's nothing to cry about I don't mind the cleavage it gives. DD and up you are certified to spill but could make it work. Nice quality and very sexy looks just as pictures and arrived fast! Can't wait to put it to use when it warms up.",5
685751,Came in three pieces panties and the two pieces that were supposed to be one it was torn in half looked like it had been worn ALOT before being sold to me I threw it away immediately sad cause it looked cute if it wasn't used and damaged not worth shipping it back and dealing with that headache,1
619714,"I normally wear a medium and this dress is slightly too big. Not the best quality, but what do you expect from a $20 dress? The color is exactly like in the pictures. It arrived earlier than the projected date which was nice. I'm 5'6 and the dress fairly short. Overall, you get what you paid for.",3

595088,Really nice look and decent quality. Waist size was true to measurements but the legs narrowed entirely too much causing the pants to be skin tight from the thigh down. Also the bib on the overall and the suspenders that's included are too short for an average height person (I'm only 5'9). I wouldn't order them again unless they were for children. I bought them for the beach so I might can get away with the tightness... But that's a big might!,3
836243,"The pictures of this dress do not show all of the extra fabric gathered at the hips. It looks like a clown dress.  I tried to return it and was told I might as well keep it and give it to someone because by the time I paid to return it, and they charge me a re-stocking fee, its not worth it.  BE AWARE OF BUYING FROM CHINA!!",1
149615,"These leggings are awesome! Couldn't be happier. One of the reviews before said they were a little see through, and I agree to a degree. I got the small size which is a little loose in spots but the fabric when stretched in areas is minimally see through. If you are wearing bright colored underwear, you will of course be able to see it through the batman logo on the butt.",4

321822,"Within a few days of wearing these shoes, a fold of fabric popped up over the area that covers the ball of left foot. Within the next 3-4 weeks that fold wore through, creating a large opening in the suede fabric.  I expected these shoes to last longer than a month!!  Very disappointed.  I have purchased New Balance shoes for years, and the last 3 pairs have had similar issues.",1
204179,I ordered a super  big size wanted an over size top for Halloween but instead of getting the medium I decided to order the 2XL which of course was too big but I picked that size . It is cute the colors are very vibrant and the material is soft and comfortable . I will wear it with pleather black leggings and a black leather vest . With the vest it sort of looks smaller so this his a good thing . I liked it a lot .,5

It looks real and people think it is, although this is not why I love it, it's just so me! The stones are just the right size not too big that they are just too blingy for me. I've learned my lesson about wearing it to do dishes and gardening...For the money I think no one could go wrong with this beautiful ring!!",5

It is easy to see how the ""one size"" actually can fit most - put it off one shoulder or the other, pull it up the neck, put it under the boobs, whatever, it fits well. It is easy to wash, easy to dry, and no ironing is required. The ""glam"" seems to be  holding up well. Buy it for comfort and looks.",5

They are very small and you can't see the closing at all. I can now wear my favorite pendant with a beautiful chain that I was not able to wear with before now, and the best part is that they are nickel free!",5

315590,"Was very pleased with the overall size of this item and the versatility of being able to either hand carry it, drape it over my shoulder, or roll it when I did not want to do either.  The construction is good and the material appears sturdy.  Good value for the money.",5
132440,"I purchased this item a size smaller than I normally would because of the feedback from previous buyers stating that the item runs too large.  The fit was good except that the items length is not as pictured as the bottom of the garmet falls at the waist not below as it should have. I guess for the price I really can't complain too much, I will just be more weary in the future when purchasing Allegra K garmets.",2

They are very well made though and I just gave it to my 10 year old daughter whom it was almost too small for her.  Good service and quality though, and they threw in an extra hair tie to match the bottoms.",4

I ordered a size large, but cup was not big enough. Definitely doesn't have a cup side anywhere near what the picture is showing.

Suit was well made and soft.",3

582082,"If I had known that these were just pajama bottoms I never would have paid so much for them. If you're hoping for pants that looks like jeans with the comfort of pajamas, these aren't it. They're also way too loose. The drawstring doesn't do much to keep them in place. Definitely  a waste of money.",2
704629,i ordered this item expecting the shirt in the picture - which DID not happen . The color of the shirt was NOT the color shown or any of the colors shown. The shirt didn't have ANY sparkles. The picture is a total different shirt. I WANT MY MONEY BACK. terrible buy. i don't know how there is good reviews this is a total rip off.,1
333115,My daughter wears a12 so I got a size 10 because it's a long dress and it's too long still and a little big in chest area but it looks beautiful on her. The fabric is decent quality so I think it will be a great pageant dress once it is hemmed.,4
435323,in the picture it looks pretty nice but as soon as i started opening up the package i regretted buying it. It just screams CHEAP. It looks like something id find at a flea market. I put it back in the mail to be sent back the same day i received it.,1
384851,"These are super soft and comfy panties. I love the mixture of basic colors and cute prints. They have a silky feel to them but they do not slide around or bunch up. They stay put and even though they are bikini style they do not show bad panty lines. The quality of these underwear really exceeded my expectations. The colors are vibrant and the detail is exceptional. You won't be disappointed with this purchase.

I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",5
400550,"LOVE this bangle. Very pretty. Has weight to it....not hollow. I get alot of compliments! I ordered 2 more. Very quick delivery. One warning though....if the bangle is too big and you need to adjust it,make sure you squeeze it gently. If you do it too hard,you can damage it(like I almost did). =(",4
111827,"Very disappointed. I was depressed and I wanted something to bring upliftment. But it made me more depressed, when I received it, it was discolored and looked bronze. The hard thing about this is because I live in Caribbean I had to pay additional taxes and shipping to get it to me and its very expensive to send it back. It's also very thin and the picture shown is misleading",1
256596,"I think this is a very cute swim suit. After it took me 20mins to figure it out, it doesnt hold up well at all. Its good for pics and thats about all lol. Im 57 and weigh 168 and no boobs lol and it still doesnt hold the small chest that I have",3
571386,"Love these leggings!  I ordered these after I bought a pair when visiting a friend in Texas.  Very comfortable and fit fine.  I am 5'1 1/2"", and they are not too long.  So far, I have not found anyone in Orange County, CA that carries them, so I will continue to shop on Amazon for additional pairs.",5

Shipping was much faster: Ordered it on the 21st June and was delivered on 29th June, although shipping estimated that it would only be delivered on 13th July. Its true to size and a beautiful piece to add to your collection. I'm just not sure what components its made of (real silver, etc) but for the price I can't complain! Chain also has a long extender for those worried that it might be too small. Photos added on.",5
178998,"is not very confortable, and too big. It does fit under glasses, but they are not ergonomic in the least level..  i wanted these to ride on my motorcycle, but wind and dust get inside from underneath.. i had a similar one before that also were over sunglasses...  plastic also is kinda ugly..",2

Its a perfect size for her, and it has a pretty deep pocket, so it blocks the sideways rain and sleet we often get in Buffalo, NY.
It collapses down and she can put it into her school bag without much effort, and it dries really quickly.
Recommend highly.",5

I will say that my eyes feel less strained when I wear these sunglassess.
That is what I wanted from the Eagle Eye glasses, so that part is very good.

Time will tell whether the clip-ons will last 6 months, 1 year, or 2 years.

The lenses are a little smaller than the lenses on my glasses, but that

This one totally conceals it. The snug (but not uncomfortable) fit, drape of the ruffles, and the optical illusion of the polka dots makes me look like I have a much flatter belly.",5
402801,Bought this hat for my daughter in pink and it is so cute. It was one of the best little investments for like only $5. She even keeps it on and doesn't pull it off. Blocks the sun from her eyes very well on bright hot days at the lake.,5
490951,"These looked nice at first. I washed them (as I wash everything before the first wear), and one sock had a gigantic hole afterward. I tossed that and the matching one as it started falling apart. Slowly over the two weeks we have had these come apart. Also, these are way too small.",2
482416,"Where did they go??? Haha
This is a nice supportive bra that really does reduce. I ordered a band size smaller as suggested by other reviewers. Also, from using Chantelle bras, I already knew the band size is generous. Always better to have a smaller band than a larger one. You can always use one of those band expander things. If you are between cup sizes, I would suggest to six up in your cup.",5

They are well made (don't rip at the seams), they don't pill, they are fitted but not too tight, they are 100% cotton, the style and color combos are very cute, and they get softer with each wash.  We will definitely will buy more as the kids get bigger.",5
339425,"I bought this hat because other people posted ""trust me, I have a huge head and this fit me just fine!"" Well guess what, I really do have a huge head and this was way too small for me. I still give it 4 stars because it worked for my wife and the lights did work and it was fun. Actually the lights are super bright, she turned it on in a bar and 4 people went permanently blind. Well, maybe not that bad, but still they are bright!",4
120853,My two year old son picked out the aqua sea friends hat and as soon as it arrived he put it on. There are no fights for him to wear it in the water or even to the park. It stays on easily and he can put it on himself. Best purchase I've made in awhile.,5
602773,I like these earrings for their great orange color and design and weight.  My only problem was they kept twisting around on the night I wore them and it seemed like almost everyone I talked with was turning one of my earrings back into place.  Maybe it was my hair that kept flipping them around but I don't normally have that problem.  They are beautiful but I'm not sure I'll wear them too often because now I'll be very aware of problem and keep checking to see if they need adjusting.,3
524768,"OK... I've read other reviews that say the shorts were cheap or tight... I got them and they are perfect.  I mean I'm 6'1 205, very athletic, and the shorts fit fine.  Not too snug and certainly not baggy.  Great for lifting... my only gripe is it took 2 weeks to get them.  Im not sure if I'll order again because of that.. but I do like the shorts a lot.  Just being honest, great shorts... long delivery time.",3
417053,"This outfit is hot BUT the pic makes it look more laytex, it's not. its actually a wet look kind of material.

The gloves came with it, but they're not as high on the arm as shown in the picture, so they're different gloves. But they still look good for pictures. The gloves will fall down.

Additionally, the stockings that are recommended to go with this dress fall down after every step.

So in conclusion AMAZING FOR PHOTOS, not so good for event wear",4
731043,I ordered this in a large which is usually what I wear. The arms and shoulders were a bit tight. It isn't horribly tight and is still wearable. The lining of the hood is very soft. It is very cute and I love how comfortable the material is. It will definitely keep me warm this winter. I received this product at a discounted rate for my honest review.,4
81254,"The print on this dress was super cute, but it was so long it just hit at all the wrong spots. I am 5'6"" and normally wear a 9-10. I got this in a large to make sure I had room in the chest, which was fine. But the dress came down halfway past me knees and was just not flattering. Would probably work well for those girls who are blessed with a few more inches of height than myself!",2
343200,"They are ok, nothing crazy. I only were them when I'm at work. I am an industrial cst, so I do move around quite a bit. They tend to try and fall out. I find myself pushing it back down a lot. So if you are very active this is not the best choice, but still a good product.",4
172492,"Finally a long dress for the short girls!!! I am 5'3 and the length fit PERFECTLY!  The dress does run a little big though.  I am 130 pounds with a DD up top, the size small was a little big on me (even in the chest area).  It's close enough that I can still wear it, but I probably could of used an extra small if it was available.",4
842742,"I like the belt in many ways, BUT it is easy to make a basic mistake if you have a small waist (mine 33""). I measured and cut it to have about a 4"" overlap beyond the buckle. Then I discovered that the ratchet holes on the back did not extend close enough to the end for the ratchet to catch unless I close it too tight. Now I cannot wear it.",3
396181,"Perfect prop for a Khaleesi Costume! Its very light weight, fits well on either shoulder with the attached strap, or you can use pins to keep it in place without the straps! It looks just like the dragon from the show. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to add an additional touch to their halloween or cosplay costume.",5
847483,"The sizing is weird! I did like everyone in the reviews said...go up a size. So we did. The top and bottom fit great...however the tail is humongous! She still loves it and it is adorable! Do to other reviews I will try to remember gently wash and hang dry, to try and make it through the summer! Considering the price its very cute and shipped fast!",4
550427,"Silky. Beautiful color.  It's a good length - not too short.  Indentation at the waist flatters the figure, instead of hanging straight or flaring out.
 I like the way if provides coverage for the shoulders instead of being too low cut like many other nightgowns.  The lace collar is a nice accent.",5
186684,I usually wear medium or large top. The reviews said to go a little bigger so I went with the extra large and it's a perfect fit. This is a sexy sturdy corset and I would definitely buy it again and recommend it.  I look forward to wearing to the Renaissance festival.,4
836631,"I really enjoyed this outfit and so did my boyfriend. The only thing that sucked is that I'm 5'4 and my torso isn't long, but it didn't come up high enough on my chest. If I would have pulled it up any further the lace would have ripped. For the price, you can't beat the product though!",4
455827,"I ordered this butt lifter for Halloween and upon receiving it I realized immediately that I wouldn't be able to use it. I'm normally a 2X, but I ordered a 3X based on other reviews.  It fit more like a large.  More like a belly buldger than shaper.  My butt, however, did have much more lift.",3
826270,"Really love the style of this dress and the material was much nicer than I expected (was not thin/see through). Unfortunately, the front of the dress where it wraps was very loose and looked like a separate piece of material hanging down. While the rest of the dress fit well, the front wrap area did not fit as shown in the picture. It was not worth altering, as the cost for alterations would have ended up being more than the dress. Decided to return.",3
93388,"Got this for my 11 year old son.  Body suit fits snug ... just as you would want it to.  However the head is too small  Can't pull zip together.  Even if we could, it is so tight his hair gets caught in the zipper.  Haven't check it in the dark to see if it glows.  (BTW, 60 watt light bulb isn't strong enough to excite molecules to fluorescent state.  Direct sunlight is best.)  Doesn't matter - it is going back.  It's a shame because my son loves it otherwise.",2
287794,"I purchased the Lace 9 kimono and love it. Although I have only had it for a few weeks, the material is not super cheap and thin and seems like it will last a good while. Fits as expected. I wear it to the beach, on the boat, and with a tank top going out wherever. Very happy with my purchase.",5
392107,"Nothing Fancy...It's hard to believe this is 100% cotton. It seems too stretchy for cotton. I usually wear a Large, but ordered a Medium based on reviews...the medium is a bit large. For the price it's okay and comfortable. It's not as pretty as I'd hoped. Make me feel a bit dowdy to tell the truth. I won't buy again...I like to feel pretty, even in PJ's...So I'll look elsewhere and pay the extra monies for something a bit nicer.",3
83274,"These work well, as a delivery driver I'm in and out of offices and a package car all day, these are dark enough to cut the glare and bright sun, but light enough to keep on while in the back of a package car or in an office.  Not only do they function well but they look good too and are cheap, so get two pair.",5
655509,"Gorgeous dress. Better in person than pictured. Great for the price. Looked like a designer dress. One of the jewels was loose on the back but it was easily tightened without sewing. I had to put a few stitches to shorten the straps because my daughter is a size 1 and the smallest dress was size 2 - but I expected to have to do this when I ordered a size 2. It will probably fit a regular size 1 or 2 my daughter is just short!
Amazing dress for the $",5
216042,The hat came in a box and was slightly uneven or rolled on one side. I let it sit flat on the table a couple hours and it went back to its natural form. Fits very comfortably and not tight for a large head and provides alot of coverage. Great value and quality for less than $20.,5
214112,"Fantastic tshirts and the quality is more than I expected. The use of spandex really keeps the shirts from being stretched out which happens with all other A type undershirts. While I wouldn't call these spanx I would agree with another viewer that these shirts keep any extra in place. Oh, order your usual shirt size. If you wear L buy L, XL buy XL.",5
579127,"LOVE this style of shirt.  I think I ordered the large.  I am approx. 5'7, 145 pounds, not thin by any stretch of the imagination.  This shirt complements my curves, and I feel comfortable in it.  I always wash clothes on gentle, so unsure what other speeds of wash will do to this lovely shirt.",5
798553,"The pattern was perfect and everything but I got a small (5""5' 120lbs) and it was fitted but I'll still wear it. Also the tie at the halter around the neck had two hooks and no clasp on my top. I'm not sure if anyone else had the same problem",4
629252,would use this as a gag gift ONLY !  LOL  it was comical to say the least trying to figure out what string went where and how it was supposed to stay in one place for any length of time is beyond me.

I ordered this bodysuit in the color white, and I am very pleased! Product came on time, brand new in sealed box. It fits exactly as pictured, very soft and comfortable and maintains that skin-tight look of a bodysuit without being too see through!",4
401592,I love these shoes....Tried them for the first time today in my Zumba class and it made all the difference. I normally wear a size 7 and got the 7M. I would say they run small and it is best to go a size bigger! You will be happy with them!,5
664294,"First even though it was very late to deliver, I'm very very happy fits perfectly well made, not able to tell if it's not one of those extremely expensive jacket that most times you're just paying for the name, this feels just as expensive no roughness like i said no one can tell it's not a very expensive great looking jacket, will be buying again in another color. Happy customers who would like for it to be on time next time. ",5
102235,"Absolutely way too large. I have bought this brand and this style of undershirt for my husband in stores at size XL and they fit perfectly. This size XL was way too big. A friend of ours tried them on after they turned out to be too big and he wears a size 3X. He said they were loose on him. Sizing is clearly not uniform. That being said, the quality of the undershirts is still good.",3
131173,"I recommend this but you should buy a smaller size, im always a size 4 or small and i got this blouse on small and fits too big(and let me tell you i have BIG boobs and even so it fit sooo big), i know it should be big but this is too much. I would buy another oe in different colors but definitly 1 or 2 sizes smaller",4
90931,"THis is the worst case scanerio of my ordering experiences.  First of all the color was not as shown in pic. There were two places where the stitching was coming apart, and last but not least, one of the pockets was just hanging.  SOOOO tacky.  Never AGAIN!!
Try inspecting your items before shipping to what used to be a trust worthy customer.",1
522769,"I love this dress. The flowery design is thread and leather, the material is lightweight but not really revealing. It hugs my curves just enough without being too tight and the colors are very compelling. I am 5ft2, 135 and a D cup, size 5/6 jeans, but I ordered the Large. Hopefully continuing to give out these stats will help someone if they are considering ordering. Just do it, it's a great dress!",5
312755,"Pros:
- Look great: I get a lot of compliments on them.
- Suitable for everyday use: they wear pretty well.
Cons:
- Not nearly as comfortable as I had hoped: The leather is very stiff. The uppers really hurt the tops of my feat for the first few weeks that I wore them. After around six months of daily use, the uppers are still very stiff and not particularly comfortable.",3
150852,"Just touching it with my hands grossed me out - let alone putting it on my body. It smells like China (or what you'd expect China to smell like), and it doesn't fit at all right. Don't waste your money. The ""gold"" clasp was tarnished in the middle. Not one redeemable quality for this dress. You were warned!",1
103418,Beautiful blouse for the price! Fits exactly as the other reviews state. True to size or maybe a tad small when compared to most generous U.S. sizing. In U.S. brands I usually wear an extra small. This blouse I ordered a small and it is perfect. It also washed up very well.,5
1825,This is exactly what I was looking for.  It's a little larger than it appears inside.  Plenty of room for what I need.  The case is rigid but may soften after some use but it's good the way it is.  It opens wide and stays open.  Room enough to pack everything you need when you travel.  I was trying to decide between this one and the larger version.  I glad I chose this one.  The size is just right for me.,5
501598,"WARNING!!! This dress DOES NOT look anything like the picture!!! It looks like a huge shapeless tent that has a sash to tie around the waist. Also, the color in the picture is a nice rich hunter green, but the actual dress is a washed out weird green. The material was okay, nothing spectacular. You definitely get what you pay for with this one.",1
572654,"If I could give this 0 stars I would. Looked shiny and pretty. Gave it to my daughter for her birthday, first off it was smaller than described. Second, my daughter wore this one time and slept in it and woke up the next morning with a swollen and green wrist all around. Unacceptable.",1
598312,"OBSESSED! Its by far the most beautiful dress I own, I'm looking for excuses to wear it. The only thing I would advise is to go up a size, because of the lace, it doesn't stretch too much. I'm 5'6 and 135 pounds, ordered a size 4 and had to send it back and get a size 6. The new dress came within 2 days! It was great. Would highly recommend this dress!",5
164323,"I absolutely love these glasses! Haven't worn them out yet, but as soon as I put them on in front of my family they all complimented me lol. Only one complaint-- it's not the fault of the manufacturer, but my nose bridge is very subtle so I have to slide them up every so often if I'm looking down at something such as my phone. But that's not a big deal! Thank you for these glasses~",4
548137,Ordered a large. MY hips are more size 14 and chest is more size 12 so figured a Large would work.  I couldn't even zip it!  The armholes gap out.  My hips are 42 with pants on.  The vest measures a scant 41.  Sending back!,1
132338,"This shirt took a long time to ship (about a month).  And it was NOT what I was expecting after reading other reviews.  The craftsmanship of this shirt is horrible. The seams are NOT sewn straight, the material is itchy and there wasn't a reciept or a way to return the garment.  I will NOT buy anything more from Allegra K!  Waste of my money, I won't wear this, and I have no way to return it.",2
140785,"As pretty as they were, they didn't last very long. They were difficult to put in and harder to close. Yesterday would've made 2 days they stayed in her ears. I noticed that one had fallen out and when I went to put I back in, the part that goes in the ear detached completely from the hoop. 2 days! Not happy at all! I'm out $30! What a waste of money!",2
243751,"I really wanted to love these jeans...but alas, there are many flaws. First and foremost they arrived with a very strong chemical smell. Like nothing I had ever smelled on clothing. Even after I washed them they still smelled so strongly it made my stomach hurt and I had to take them off. After a few washes the smell faded (but yuck!). The drawstring openings are NOT reinforced (like buttonhole openings) and have started to rip. For a $50 pair of sweatpants I absolutely expected more. I wouldn't buy another pair nor recommend them to friends sadly.",2
537839,"I bought this watch as a gift for a friend. I also bought the black one for her as well (Music Major). The white and black came separate but in similar packaging. It was just in an envelope, which is why the face of the white watch was shattered. I was very unsatisfied and was not asked if I would have liked a refund or a new one. The band is very cheap and was basically a piece of thin plastic. You would have to purchase a new band if you wanted this watch long term.",2
394185,I had my baby four days ago and my milk came in last night.  The clasp on the left cup of the nursing bra I wore today busted after I finished feeding my baby.  I'm disappointed as today was the second time is worn said bra and I'm not so completely engorged that it would merit broken clasps.,2
103782,"It is a beautiful shirt and a really nice fabric but the thing is that is very hard to get your head in...really weird but it is not as wide a neck as it looks in the picture and i guess you have to have a really small head or you will have to struggle to get the shirt in, like me :s",3
879616,"A very nice weight for in-between weather.  Seems well made.  It fits a little bigger than I was expecting, but it's fine.  The only thing I don't like are the smallish hidden snaps going down the front of the coat.  They don't seem that sturdy, like they'll tear off.  The gray color is pretty dull too.  All in all though it'll be a nice coat for cooler weather.",4
3985,"Lovley dress, a little too big though it will work. I'm 5'1 and 132 pounds ( I got the small) and its comes to just above my knees and the top of the dress shows a little more breast than planned. Still it's wonderful, good quality and definitely worth the money :-)",5
103097,"Initially I loved this suit. Fit beautifully and loved the look. After wearing it only a handful of times, the fabric started to stretch and pull apart in very obvious places. It looks terrible. I'm very disappointed having spent so much money on a suit that can't be repaired or worn anymore. I do not recommend this to anyone who wants a suit that lasts. The last one I owned for 15 years. Quality fabric is important in swimwear.",1
32594,"Well, I am a standard 34G, have been professionally measured, so that is what I ordered, well, it looked like a size 28 or 30 G, I couldn't get it on the normal way no matter how I tried, so fastened it and stepped into it and rolled it up to my chest and it was fine, very supportive, I hope it stretches out enough for me to put it on like a normal human being. I am top-heavy and quite petite in the waist and hips so my method won't work if you are more pear-shaped, I supect.",4
716782,"Incredibly nice concept that didn't suit my feet at all.  The design is great but it felt very uncomfortable to actually wear them.  Far too tight and narrow. If you're gonna give these a try - go at least a half size up, maybe a whole size if you wanna wear socks with them.  The burrito tongue is a nice touch and would probably be fantastic in application, but the shoes were so tight that I never even attempted to tie them.",2
486628,Wish it was longer and more comfy looking like the picture but I am still satisfied. This is not a U.S size XXL I normally wear a L to XL in U.S sizes and if possible I would go a size up still. But it does fit and is cute for chilly fall days.,4
339671,I gave them 3 stars only because the metal is cheap and not heavy as I expected it and some of the pearls have damaged surface. The metal has a rose orange gold color not a yellow color like real gold. The flowers are nicely executed and overall it has a nice look.,3
521246,"My five-year-old daughter absolutely loves this jacket.  She wears it everywhere she goes.  The zipper is a little finicky sometimes, but not quite enough to mark it down a star (maybe a half a star).  The little girls' large size fit her perfectly, although I should note that she is tall for a five-year-old.",5
95396,Yes it's small but if u realize the seam is for your chin and not your nose and that the zipper goes behind your right ear it fits fine wouldn't recommend for an adult there's no way it'll fit you but super soft and does the job I want it to,4
375935,"It fits nicely but is a tad small. If you have thick hair or really long hair this is not for you. The material is very nice and it is a snug fit so the likelihood of falling off while sleeping is minimal. It does help to keep the moisture on my hair which is must needed for my course, curly hair.",5
321399,"Looks cute as can be, but the pivot is very loose so the bar moves VERY easily, it is so small you can't really hold it directly so it is pretty difficult to actually put in. However once you get it in it is secure while being very comfortable to unclick when it's time to take it out which is great for a lower cost clicker... I've had them get stuck before.",4
362299,This is pure genius. One of those products that is so obviously a great idea that you wonder why someone didn't think of it sooner. I have Silhouettes rimless and it is a pain getting these in a case the several times I day I take them off. At night I don't want to worry about it. These work perfectly. Pictures attached. I love them and will probably get another one for the bathroom.,5
594388,"I like the coat overall - comfy and warm, but not overly bulky. The only think I don't like about it is the pockets. They have zipper closures, which would be nice for keeping things safely stowed away, but the zipper is rough and scratches my hands to pieces when I pull them in and out of the pockets. They either need to remove the zipper or use a thinner/finer zipper that isn't as abrasive.",4
394924,"I usually wear a 1X in tops but after reading the reviews I decided to order the 2x. The shirt fits my body just fine but the top portion of the sleeves is very tight on my arms. The material is denim, but it's very thin denim. I like the shirt ok, but I just wish that it had a little stretch to it so that i could wear it comfortably.",3
5198,I've ordered several pairs of these pants over the past few years. These recent ones are smaller than the rest and have no tag. They also feel like a different material. Took them to a local store to compare them to the ones they stock and they are very different. Showed a employee and they said they looked like knock offs. Further online research and they were indeed knock offs. Sending them back.,1
880201,"I saw how large it was in other reviewer photos, but I was still a little shocked by how large when it arrived. It's beautiful and I've worn it several times but I have to use my own cord because the cord it arrived with is too short (I have a wide neck).Definitely a special piece to have, indeed!",4
196540,"Way too small. I am between a B and C cup (usually 34C) and ordered Medium. Plus they unstuck about 3 hours into the night...I was paranoid about them unsticking the entire time...didn't feel too secure. These are cheap, so maybe worth a try, but I advise you get a large size.",2
647243,This is cute I did have bunching at the stomach area for my shape it wasn't as flattering as other bathing suits so I decided to wear it with shorts. Know your body! If you are lean and straight up and down this is for you. If you are curvy pass on this one,3
319874,"So i didn't wanted to believe the reviews when i read them, some good some bad, however, most where about it cames a little big, or it is plastic/foam material. Which i didn't mind to pay the $53, however what is upsetting is that the zipper is broken. So not only i paid 53 dollars but now i have to look for someone to fit the dress. Not cool!!!!",2
90274,"These rings were lovely for exactly 3 days before they turned my fingers green and looked tarnished. I can't believe they were the same ones that the other reviewers rave about. Where was the nice packaging? Mine came in a plastic baggie.
I was very disappointed with this purchase and would not recommend at all. Save your money!",1
828709,"Dress originally came with a rip in the side at the waist, but was immediately sent a replacement after I contacted the seller. Very fast shipping to USA and the dress is gorgeous. Nice and flowy, perfect even on hot days (very breathable fabric) and soft against skin. I am 5' 7"" and 130lbs with a 34C bust. I ordered a large because Asian sizing runs small (I normally wear a size Small) and it fit perfectly. Do size up!",5
710775,"This dress is amazing! I'm 5'2'' 130 pounds ordered a size 10. I was so shocked by the quality, it's so well made and fit great (it is a little long and will need to be altered). The seller emailed me shortly after I ordered to confirm the size and color and even quickly resolved a shipping issue. The only bad thing about this dress is how hard it is to take off, I wanted to wear it all day!",5
408156,"This necklace arrived today (quick ship!) and I am extremely pleased with this purchase.  The price was excellent and the necklace looks very substantial and expensive, but not 'too much' by any means.

One thing to note...the backside of the necklace is flat, so it doesn't roll around at all, and it's very comfortable, in addition to looking so nice.

Almost forgot to mention - it arrived in a rather nice little folding case, too, that would be excellent for gift-giving.

I highly recommend this necklace!  Thank you, Netaya.  I will be back.  =)",5
93927,There was I seam rip in one of the fingers as soon as I got them.  I also got size XXL and they were still too small for me... normally XXL gloves fit me.  I am returning them.  I have had many gloves in the past and if they fit without the seam rip they probably would have been decent gloves for the price.,2
429003,"The belts are well made and look nice, but they will not hold anyone's pants up!!
They were no doubt sold so inexpensively because the there is no tensile strength
in the elastic element of the belt. It will stretch to easily twice its size, so consequently
if you want a belt for pants that are a bit large for you, these will not work. If just for
looks then they are definitely worth the price.",2
312178,I absolutely LOVE these shoes. These are my absolute favorite. So light and comfortable. These are actually my 2nd pair. I am still wearing my 1st pair after 2 years and they look good still. I am just afraid they are going to disappear and I want a back up pair for when my 1st pair wears out. These have been the best shoes I've owned!,5
812278,"I ordered one size up, and it fits well, so I would say sizes run a little small in this brand.  Also, the fabric (I got blue) is a little see-through, but not too obvious until you get up close.  But the fabric is super soft and it looks good!",4
795103,I should have listened to the comments about how bad the odor was.  The smell is indeed terrible.  It does not smell like leather or plastic. No amount of airing could make it go away.  Also the credit cards slots are awful. The top slot is so deep it swallows the card and the others are not deep enough and too tight to fit the cards appropriately.  SAVE your money.  It is cheap and now I know why.,1
227934,"Not a bad product. Good purchase for the price but the ""one size fits all"" was too big. It had an ""L"" sticker for large on the package wrapping. My wife had to send it back. She's usually a size 2 and the skirt had about 4 extra inches of room",4
160096,Love love love this! Got it for Christmas to wear over black leggings. It's incredibly comfortable and covers my tush so I can wear it to work. I've gotten so many compliments on it. The only downside is that they don't have more colors! Otherwise I would buy all of them.,5
553123,"It's so nice to find a cami that is long enough, and where going up in size doesn't mean only increasing the garment width.  The shelf bra (size L) is comfortably deep enough for my post-baby 36DD, but not so large that going down to post-nursing 34/36D will make it too roomy.  I love wearing these under lightweight tshirts for my gym and yoga workouts.",5
684020,"The material is soft with some stretch and is thicker than I anticipated. It is flattering on my curvy frame! I'm a 36 DDD and the cups in the bodace are flattering and slightly minimizing, making the dress more demure. This is nice since the dress is a cherry red, you can't help but stand out wearing it!",4
541079,"This scarf is really nice.  It's just as pictured, tassels and all, and arrived very fast.  It's pretty lightweight, which is perfect for here in Texas, and definitely oversized, which is very in right now.  The colors are amazing- blue, grey and brown tones, that will coordinate easily with any outfit or overcoat.  I'm keeping this for myself, but now plan to purchase more for gifts. Solid buy and the price is great.",5
306568,"The photo makes this look like it's a straight line/hem top, that it hits at your thighs, and that it covers your rear.  It's more like a hideous sweatshirt with a gathered elastic waistband that doesn't cover your behind. I wanted to like this and thought it might look cute with leggings, but it's not flattering at all and nothing like the photo.",1
123001,"I love this, I am 5'8 and about 190 lbs (all old baby weight) I bought an XL I was so afraid this would be to small but it's not, it's actually a little big. I would have preferred it be a little smaller at the bottom. Since I got this one I've bought 3 other shirts from this company. I don't know how to post a picture but I will if I can.",5
158535,"These are one of the best tools for looking clean and put together at all times. Sit down, shirt comes untucked. With these, stand up and your shirt does the tucking for you. As a rather wide man, these are the best any unkempt appearance makes a big guy look like a slob, this prevents that , plain and simple.",5
848423,"Super cute suit! The top is a bit too big, but I like it enough I'm going to stitch the strap a little and make it fit. It mostly well made, the leg holes are rather tight, but I imagine it'll loosen up when it gets wet. Overall I feel it's about on par with a target swim suit as far as quality and fit!
I received a discount on this in exchange for my review.",4
500513,"The dress was not as expected.  I looked through the reviews, noticed several that said their order was to large.  As I prefer loose-fitting cloths that allows me to move without feeling confined, I went ahead an ordered my normal size... and its to small.  The martial is thin, inner slip is black and several inches above the knee (I'm 5'7""), the outer dress/tunic is navy and, as other reviewers have stated, the belt is black which doesn't really match.

Its 'okay' but not a must have dress.",3
783100,I love this top! It's comfortable and extremely flattering. I'll be ordering more in other colors! It fits perfectly and the fabric is very soft. It's well made as well. I ordered measuring off my bust. I got a size 4 shirt and I wear a 34 C bra. If you have sizing questions let me know!,5
412385,"This hat doesn't have a lot of structure and the sides stuck out a bit awkwardly on my smaller head. It is lightweight and very functional with no logo (I try to avoid advertising for a company if they aren't paying me).  Not bad, but I don't think you're winning many style points with this one.",3
171332,"I bought this and once I got it, I decided that I really didn't want it. I would have returned it, but there were too many tricks to returning it and wasn't really worth it. I opted to just keep it since I was only going to possibly get back half the money I spent on it.",3
15829,"They should advice that the shirt was a slim fit, I assumed it was regular fit and the reception I went too every time I sat or bent down the buttons would pop out, it was a disaster and very uncomfortable, The quality was very good but !! what do you want to do replace it with a regular fit or a refund ?",3
199539,"I lovethis top. It looks exactly as depicted. The only complaint I have is that the bottom of it needed a few more inches , it was close on the hips as it is long. I received many compliments when I wore it. Would buy others if there were more prints.",4
529846,"We bought this dress at a local children's boutique and it's GORGEOUS. The photo doesn't even come close to showing how full the skirt is - it's a truly voluminous dress and my daughter could not stop twirling. The ribbons for the shoulders are a bit slick, but I was able to tie them in bows with a double knot and they stayed put. My daughter is 38-39 inches tall and 32 pounds and the 3/4 is perfect on her. I love the stretchy top - it's so much easier to get onto a wiggly three-year-old.",5
873008,"I love it! I do recommend getting a bigger size. On clothes I'm between a small and medium so I bought this bathing suit in m and l. I was able to fit in both of them but l felt so much Comfortable with the large since it doesn't stretch much the large gave me more room. I'm 5'2"" 125lbs 34b. It covers all the my flaws and makes me feel sexy. Great buy",5
660026,"Ordered the 3X for my wife who is between size 16-18. This barely fit and it was a tight fit at that. I'd say the 3X is more like a 12-14 that will stretch a size bigger. Otherwise, it does look hot on her... but I don't see her wearing it more than once or twice.",2
466636,Some of the images do not display the correct color. I ordered a dress based off the picture. It showed a plum color but it's listed as rust. I was needing a dress for a wedding this weekend. I'd recommend fixing this so there's no confusion to your buyers. I saw the ratings were good which is kind of disappointing. Delivery was quick and packaging was great.,2
563611,"They fit but I specifically ordered these because the description read HOOK & EYE closure.  They are not and my son (who had hand surgery) cannot get them on and off without help.
Tried to return but learned that I would have to pay for shipping and possibly a 10% restocking fee.

What's worse - paying for an item he cannot use with ease OR a partial payment for an item I cannot keep.",1
409478,"This rolling bag is truly awesome.  It is high quality, roomy and fits my oversized laptop perfectly.  There are slots for files and plenty of room for cords, etc.  Works great as a full briefcase.  It has enough room to be used as an overnight bag as well.  I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase.  Love the color -- a classy deep red leather.

It arrived in a timely fashion and was packaged very well.",5
167216,"These babies are fun to wear and very light. Keep in mind that there not real gold, okay. Those that are allergic to wearing fake rings, I highly don't recommend you buy these. I was able to wear one on each finger except for my thumb. Their all the same size as indicated in the info section. It depends on your fingers, not the rings.",4
422664,"I love Robeez for babies.  Seems better to me than sending baby to daycare with just socks, but doesn't impede their foot development or progress to walking.  These are cute, although the mismatched colors is a little weird and I'm not sure I would buy this exact design again.  But you can't go wrong with Robeez.",5
687185,Our daughter loves Doc McStuffins so we had to get these for her.  She absolutely loved them when we first gave them to her and wants to wear them to bed all the time.  The quality is pretty good but the material does pill up after a dozen washings.  The color also fades some but that is to be expected.  Otherwise they are a great pair of PJ's for any toddler girl.,4
443191,I look really nice but it was a little too big for the finger it's suppose to be on but I rapped some string around it so it would fit and on the side of the side of the ring it looks some what burnt? Or something but it's not noticeable when I'm wearing it.,4
551540,"I am petite, a 32B and a size 1 in pants.  I ordered an extra small. The bottoms fit perfectly and they are adjustable. But the top was WAY too large. They looked like they would fit a C to a D cup. I would not recommend for small busted girls",3
89217,"It's what I expected for the price and after reading the reviews... Big comfy sheer and I love it! I can dress it up with a big belt and necklace or just wear it over leggings or skirt for easy casual. I don't mind that it's thin since I usually wear a tank top under everything anyways and I live in south Florida where it's usually pretty hot.

UPDATE: July 2017 - STILL love this shirt. It's one of my go-to favorites over a pair of nice jeans...",5
115375,These have very dark lenses which is a must have when driving during the summer if you don't want to have night blindness after the sun sets.. The Black Matte frames is unique in wayfarer style glasses and may not appeal to some people that want the look of the classic style glasses.,5
782045,"WOW, what a quality wallet for the price!! The design is perfect and holds everything I need and so much more compact than my checkbook clutch which is too heavy. I got it in the red and very nice. Great sleeve for pen and open side for paper money or paper, receipts etc. Again, the design and quality for what I paid far exceeds my expectations. May order another to keep on hand.",5
41249,"My son and his wife are expecting their first child soon, and I gave one to him stuffed with diapers.  It was a huge hit.  Hasn't been used yet, but looks like it will do the job, looks nice (and manly), and has plenty of pockets for all that baby paraphernalia.",5
120784,"I ordered a size up because several reviews said they ran small, and it is too big. They only reason I ordered these is because a Little Swimmer makes my son chafe so bad on his inner thighs, I think these will work great once I order his correct size.",3
455704,"We ordered this for my son for his spring formal dance. The color on the computer matched the color swatch from his dates dress. When it arrived, it wasn't close to the right color. We were trying to save money, but ended up having to get one from the tux store instead.",1
689331,I purchased this in two colors.  It looks very sexy and attractive on the model. I'm not sure how they get the V to go down in the front.  Additionally on one of mine the string that holds the bead in the back is about 8 inches too long and it drags nearly to my waist.,2
141058,"An excellent tie, good quality.
This is one of 3 I purchased recently from longtiestore to put into my daily rotation. It has a good weight to it like most woven silks, although it's not as thick as some high end products if that matters to you.  It's certainly one of my new favorites.
I'm a bigger guy, just over 6'1, and it is the perfect length for me.
On a side note, the customer service at longtiestore was phenomenal. Putting that together with the quality and value of the ties, and I now have a new go-to seller.",5
73868,"I purchased these for my self but I didn't care for the size of them on my face, as my face is very round and small. I gave these to my daughter and she loves the bigger size glasses. She wears them all the time and they look great on her.",5
432364,"I ordered the same jeans in a different color and the length was almost perfect and the fit was just a tad loose, but these are the right color and fit tighter but were about 3 inches longer. Both orders were regular length.  I'm afraid to order the short.  I usually don't have blue rub off on my white tennis shoes but these did.  I've tried wiping and cleaning off but it won't come out.  I don't like using bleach when I can't actually wash and dry the item.",4
505948,"I love the hoody for my little Pooh fan.  It is as cute as pictured along with being soft and thick.  Appears to be very durable.  We are saving for our son to wear this year trick or treating as part of his Pooh costume and added bonus he can wear this when he wants after. Super cute, very affordable, very happy with my purchase.",5
822972,"I ordered the size medium in these, but I normally order up a size in panty hose or tights because I prefer the extra material and less stretch (I feel it prevents tearing more), and these mediums fit a bit true to size on me, so if I had ordered a small, I think it would feel too tight. For reference, I'm 5'4"" and 110lbs. They are nice quality, and feel durable. My only qualm is that the nude hose are a bit shiny. I wish the nude color looked more natural. I'm still keeping them, though.",4
389946,"I prefer FTL over the other brands, so ordered a pack of these, and a 6 pack of the fashion briefs. The six pack is not a good fit at all and were returned. These have better and wider elastic in the waist band, and are cut perfectly....so I bought another 4 pack of them.",5
611157,"Literally the cutest sweater ever. I was confused when I got it at first because it doesn't technically have sleeves, there's just 2 holes you put your arms in. But once you get it on, it's so chunky and slouchy, I love it! It's about 3/4 sleeves and super soft. I'm 5'3"" and 135lbs and it fit so comfortably on me! Buy it!!",5
830689,"Beautiful dress, quality is good. Runs very small. I normally wear a Small (B cup), but went with Medium after reading reviews. It fit very snug, so ended up with Large to get it to fit correctly. Very low cut, I stiched the bra area to cut down on cleavage.",4
262396,"This was purchased as a wedding gift by my sister for me. It arrived in a very cute box, well packaged against harm. I think it is adorable! It's meant to be fashion jewelry, which isn't going to be fine quality- ever. It's got a good weight to it, and fits well. I've got rather big wrists and had very little problems getting it on. I don't think it's a bad deal at all, especially for the price!",3
659757,"This is a great cover up. I'm only 5 feet tall, 143 lbs, size 9/10.  It fits just perfect. I think it can fit up to a size 14. The front is about mid thigh.  The back side is just long enough to cover my bottom.  The white color kept me nice and cool in the hot sun. Even when wet,  it did not weigh too heavy.  My husband said it made me look sexy in it.  : )",5
133997,"The material is thin, but I'm not sure exactly what people were expecting for the price. Overall, this cardigan is way cute!!! I'm usually a size 8/10 and a medium fits perfectly. Looks cute with sleeves pushed up. Comfy and easy to throw on whenever you need a topper. So satisfied with this cardigan!",5
405782,"I just bought the new version of the Nike+ Sportsband at Nike Town, and I have to say I LOVE it. I've heard negative things about the first generation but so far the new second generation is great! I don't have Nike+ running shoes so I bought a Nathan pocket from REI and the accuracy is right on straight from the box. Syncs flawlessly to my Mac and keeps track of all my data via the [...] site.",5
268774,"This dress started falling apart the first night I wore it. I washed it once and it completely fell apart at the shoulder where it's stitched together. The clasps near the breasts also came off within the first two times wearing it. Definitely NOT worth the money. It was made very cheaply and I felt really ripped off. I LOVE the way it looked and fit on me. I'm super upset that it's falling apart because in theory, it's a really cool dress",1
253761,I bought this wallet after trying many that didn't for my phone. I love it. It's spacious and fits everything nicely. It even fits lipsticks with everything packed in. My phone is safe and secure. The  soft leather is a great look and feel. I would highly recommend this product!!!,5
63867,"I thought that it would at least be made of real material. Instead it is the same plastic used in the clear ponchos we use to get at rainy football games. Holds in the muggy heat so that even though not getting the rain on you you are sweating so wet anyway.

So not worth the money.. I wish I could get my money back.",1
258893,"I have used these swim diapers for years for my two kids and they are truly the best swim diaper.  Absorbent and contain the poo.  My kids have sensitive skin so we can't use the disposable swim diapers or they get horrific diaper rashes.  These are gentle, wash up well and do everything you could ask a swim diaper to do.  Just size up and definitely refer to the size chart.  My daughter is a thin 2 year old, 25 lbs and wears a 3T swim diaper.",5
99754,"Although i love the way the bag looks, it came with a shoulder strap but no where to attach it! I was very dissatisfied with my recent purchase, I thought it was going to be a hassle to return it so I just kept it. Regardless of the fact that i think its cute,  I will probably not be buying anymore items from this seller",2
828498,"The other reviews did say that this ran large. However, I am usually an extra large so I ordered a large, the larger is actually still a bit big. I am keeping the large because I am afraid the medium will end up being to small. Also the garter straps are long.",3
812340,"Nice hat, all wool.  The fit was more than tight, and I don't want to walk around like some ridiculous hipster in a too-small trilby.  This hat is not a trilby, by the way, nor is it broad brimmed.  It's tailored and fairly ladylike.  After I pulled the ribbon and bow off I was able to stretch the hat to fit my 7 3/8 (58 cm) head.  I'll sew on another band, or maybe keep this narrow black ribbon. Overall, for the price this is hard to beat.",5
95380,"If you're expecting a mask that also covers your neck like in the photo then you'll be disappointed, but if you're just looking for a cheap quick Kakashi mask that goes around over your mouth and nose then this will work fine. It took a little fixing to get it to actually come up and cover my eye though. It's not bad, it's just not great.",3
442328,This is my very favorite running bra -- I sure hope Moving Comfort keeps making this style.  The thing that makes this style so special is it provides excellent support without creating that uniboob look.  I also wear the Urban X-Over playing golf for the moisture wicking and I feel great in it.,5
324921,"Best pair of sunglasses I've owned. Especially for the money. I have to complaints, they look great, they shipped fast, and they protect against the sun really well. The little bag they come with is great too. Oh and if you've seen the movie Nightcrawler, they look just like Jake Gyllenhaal's character, Louis Bloom's sunglasses. Seriously, like exactly like those.",5
52936,"Love this hat. Very easy to strap onto our 17 month old's head without her easily being able to pull it off. Blocks the sun well, which is really needed because of her fair skin. Plus the price was so reasonable. Thought it might be cheaply made but it was a really nice quality. Would definitely recommend.",5
652088,"Don't have time to send it back, so glad I can sew.. Ordered an XL cause it was my measurements, yet the measurements of the jacket i received are far bigger. It looks nothing like the sellers picture. Its not well made and the quality is definitely not what was depicted in the image.",1
223193,I ordered according to the size chart. I am 5'6'' and wear a size 12. I could fit 2 of me in this shirt. The sleeves fit well but the shirt itself if way too big. Too bad I ordered 3 of these! The model must be wearing an XXX-SMALL.,1
485020,"The fabric is see-through, so you have to wear a slip under the dress. There aren't enough pearls on the necklace so some of the string is exposed. I'll probably end up just cutting them off because they look cheap anyways. The belt does not come with the dress. Wore this dress once and it's been hanging out in my closet for two years now. I'll probably end up just throwing it out to be honest.",1
71047,"I like these socks so much that I took out all my old, cotton socks, and made them into napkins!  (Really!  I cut them open and serged around the edges, creating perfect little napkins ... with a bit of bas-relief.  Waste-not, want-not, don'cha know.)  I will only purchase Incredisocks from now on.  These Incredisocks really do warm up your feet ... and they feel wonderful!  I highly recommend Incredisocks Diabetic Crew (or Ankle) Socks to anyone who has trouble with poor circulation and cold feet.",5
537989,"The black vest is sooooo short!  I ordered it in Brown, same size L and it looks great. This black one barely hits my waist and I'm a petite 5'1!  How can the seller send the ""same"" product yet they look/fit completely different? Look at the picture below The black also sheds horribly. My bathroom floor had so many strands on it from just opening it, trying it on taking a pic and putting it back in the bag.  I really wanted the black. I'm disappointed. I have requested a refund.",1
206089,"Blue was darker than picture, runs shorter (not as long) than it appears in their picture. I wish it was lighter in color. It looks more black than blue. Came with string dangling from it which I pulled. a part of it unthreaded. Wasn't sewn correctly. Other then the string, I think it's beautiful",4
462239,"The size was to be a 12-14 UK this made me think it was a large USA 12-14 dress.  It came as a Medium 8/10 I gave it to my grandaughter which is a size 5 it fit her ok.  I will not order any more dresses from this seller.
NOT HAPPY AT ALL",1
697396,"Bottoms fit as expected, but the top was a bit small. It also came with the back strap sewn in twisted, so it wouldn't lay right.  It was an easy fix to rip the seam out and untwist the strap, then re-sew it. Wore it to a beach vacation, and it stood up well.",4
868369,"Nervous about online buying but this was a great purchase.  Great fabric combo, nice colors, great fit.  Will say the green mesh panel is not see through. It is layered on top of the pant and that works great for me as I do not like that much mesh.  Also note, these are 'squat proof ladies.",5
33795,"I like these a lot, they're very comfortable, I just didn't think they'd fit me since I'm quite curvaceous, but it works.
The only problem is that they do roll down a bit, but I'll find a way to battle that lol The shipping was fast, and I didn't even pick that fast option. I would recommend these.",4
371033,"LOVE these ~ the quality of these was so surprising, for the price. I ordered a second pair. They do fit a larger face, I usually have trouble finding sunglass to fit, but these are comfortable, stylish, and excellent quality. Again, for this price, they feel and look like they cost 5 times what I paid, at least!",5
371270,They have small frames and I was looking for something with bigger frames. They stole one of the pictures from shevoke. The Misha Rose Golds. So that's supper annoying cause those are about $100 glasses and these are a different color and very delicate. But you get what you pay for so I'm not too upset about it.,3
836406,Cute purse and nice size can fit my note books for work in it my main complaint which is important is that the inside of the bag smells terrible no matter what I sprayed in it the smell never left so I don't know what I am going to do with it. May be returning it!,2
198889,"Nice quality fast shipping,  but they are too small.  Bought a pair for each of my kids and NONE fit.  I just got them all the same size shoes from K-mart (as a spare/gym shoes) and they have plenty of room to grow in those.  I couldn't even squeeze their feet in these DC's so it can't be that I just goofed and ordered the wrong sizes. :(
I'm returning and reordering in a bigger size for each,  hoping they get here  and FIT before school starts!!",3
196967,I bought this for a hospital robe to use after the birth of my son. It still fit while I was 9mo pregnant and VERY round. I got the color muave and it is beautiful. So silky soft and the design is vibrant.  Excellent quality and makes you feel beautiful.,5
96007,"I ordered it a size  up after reading the reviews. I like the fit to be lose enough to sit down in it and that's what I got. The hubby still thinks it's sexy and it's not showing anything. I think it will even get my mother in laws approval :D
So it is a great dress for the price!!!",5
362208,I bought 3 of these eye glass holders. They are exactly what I wanted.  I put one next to my computer for my computer glasses.  I like them so much that I ordered another one.  One is for my husband for Christmas.  I am sure he will like it.,5
521861,"The dress fit as expected, the size chart attached was very useful. I'll say if you happened to have a tall frame you might want to go up a size if you really want a good length. The dress tends to run short, so you really have to use the chart provided or you'll be setting yourself for disappointment. I'm very happy with my purchase, the dress is very flattering!",5
656303,"My husband loves his Festive Santa Cap! This Santa Cap helped make our family Christmas pics even more fun. It arrived quickly. I did have to reshape the cap by placing a rolled up damp towel inside the cap; and placing a soup can on the brim. I guess its shape got messed up during shipping, although the box was fine.  Absolutely recommend.",5
427977,"We actually bought these for a Halloween costume since my son wanted to be ""Tiger Boy"".  Since I am kind of piecing this costume together, I figured pajamas were the way to go so I could get double duty out of them!  They fit him perfectly.  He is 5 years old and is between an 5T and an XS in ""big boy"" clothes.  These are perfect!  Just the right length and snuggness.  He loves them and wants to wear them all the time.  also the fabric is really soft.",5
336412,It's great because it has lots of room.  Maybe just too many pockets for me.  Will take me too long to find which area I put my phone or keys...You have to be really organized not to have to sit around and fiddle with every zipper finding what you need.,3
737218,"The color was perfect, THe belt was nice, decent material in general but I think mine was a miscut- I cannot wear it. I generally wear a size 2-4 and I ordered a small and it fits everywhere but it won't button the last two buttons its like it taken in on one side. I think it was just a oversight. Will try for a new one, or a refund.",1
631714,"I love this dress! It is elegant but can be worn for casual occasions as well, I am roughly a size 8 and fits great around my waist. The length is a bit long so I will always have to wear heels with it but I planned on that anyway!!",5
644121,I just love it....wanted it somewhat larger so I  could wear it up to our olympic  size pool in a gated community and when I  got out of pool wet anf it's  cold it doesn't  cling trying to get into it....so yes would recommend it....want another one but will wait for the sale again,5
798240,"I love the back of the top piece on this swimsuit. The top is amazing (a little sideboob shows, but not too much to be noticeable). The small was pretty perfect for me ( 5'4, 115 pounds). The bottoms are extremely small though. They still fit, but shaving is pretty necessary. The bottoms do cover everthing.",4
17700,I bought this set to wear with my ring that my husband had made for me.  I have tried several rings and used the 2 smaller bands. They clean up so wonderfully and blend rigt with my platinum/diamond ring that I wear with it.  I would recommend this ring if you are looking to make a set with an engagement ring.,5
43792,"This umbrella is going to be great for taking walks and encouraging my four year old to play out in the rain.  It came so dirty however that its clear plastic looked like it had been scratched or something.  It was just dirt but a little bit disappointing.  We did not return umbrella - just wiped it clean because surely it will get dirty from use over time.

Great size, great colors and the plastic smell is reminiscent of smells from my childhood",3
833872,"These are cute but the discription is inaccurate. It says it is a fully fibboned hair clip however, the bottom portion is the clip is exposed and NOT covered with ribbon. Can very easily snag or scratch children's scalps. Yes they are cute and seem to be of good quality but was disappointed to be mislead and. Or have the entire clip covered.",1
35311,I needed to get a set of glasses because I kept losing mine. I got the assortment of black and brown.  I handle them with care and they work just fine.  They seem to be made for smaller head but I'm just careful When I put them on.,3
688764,Love the dress but it seem a little too small ( sz NB) and not stretchy at all. I had to return for a size 3M.. I rather had it fit my baby big than for it to be tight or small. I'm currently 8 months pregnant and my baby might be on a little big according to my doc. So I wanted to be safe than sorry. I think it will probably fit a preemie rather well.,4
150775,"The quality of the dress was fantastic...especially for the price.  I'm 5""5, 155 and 38C, so I ordered a large.  Which fit me great.  The hip area, where I am ""smaller"" at, was fine.  The dress didn't fit like a second skin and I actually didn't want it too.  I could move and dance around in it.  I paired the dress with a 3 inch heel ankle stap pump and it was a success, if I should say so myself.

I will be ordering from this supplier again.",5
259810,"i love this top! its super comfy, and really cute. Holds up to heat transfer vinyl. Got a TON of compliments on it, and the woman who does my decals even bought some for herself. I usually wear a 1x and sized up to 2x so it would be a little loose. It fit perfect",4
842534,you get what you pay for .... it does not look like the picture at all !! if you are crazy about Oakley spent $140 and get the real OILRIG OAKLEY .... when I request a return they said I have to ship it to china and pay for the shipment what a waste of time and money!!,1
564375,I ordered my normal size medium but be warned it is a generous sized tank.  So I contacted the manufacturer and they kindly accepted my return for a refund and I ordered a size small.  It fit as expected without being too tight or too loose.  The material is soft and solid feeling.  I ordered the light blue and it seems like it would not become sheer even after a sweaty yoga practice.  Highly recommended!,5
26838,"If you suffer low back pain or knee pain I recommend giving these a try. I own 6 pair and leave them in my shoes or swap around. These changed my life. I suffered from low back pain my whole life. After an injury a podiatrist recommended these to me because of my natural high arch in my feet. That was in 2011, I started putting these in all my shoes and I haven't had back pain since. Give it a shot. Your comfort is worth the minimal price.",5
14663,"After paying $300 for custom-made orthotics, I wanted to give these a try. I had my #1 metatarsals shortened to relieve the stress on the toe joint, but the weight of walking got shifted to my 2nd metatarsal and it has been giving me pain.  I purchased a set of these and put them in some shoes that weren't prone to work very well with orthotics.  So far so good.  I work in situations where I have to do a lot of walking and I am encouraged by the early results.",5
615223,"I love the shirt, but pay attention to the reviews... This runs very small... I wear a juniors medium and ordered this in an XL BC of the reviews stating that it ran so small... Needless to say it fit fine in the XL, glad I ordered it in an XL",5
704375,"This shirt is made exceptionally well, fits perfect. Follow the sizing chart when you order. I can't brag enough about the stitching on this. It is made to last, I will be ordering my boyfriend more colors. 
I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.",4
43057,"These are great little cheaters.  Since they are inexpensive you don't have to worry about losing them.  And if you have a big stupid slobbery dog like I do, breakage is not so traumatic.  Plus you get enough that you can stash them around the house (car, purse, RV, boat, batmobile, dog-sled, treehouse, whatever).  I will probably order this a couple times a year when I start running low!",5
831948,"Only reason why I'm not giving 4  is due to the fact that this bag does not stand up on its own. Must be propped up against something. Otherwise it is great quality, fits my hp 360 13.1 inch laptop perfectly, even with a laptop case. Plenty of room for charger and lots of other necessities.",4
821496,"I really like the idea of this cover up.  Unfortunately, it's a little small for me.  I am a L or XL and it doesn't fit around me with enough room to drape in a flattering way.  With that being said, it's a beautiful color and the fabric is very soft.  So I've decided to still use it as a cover up, but more like a sarong.  I just tied it around my waist.
I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",4
803857,"THIS IS A GORGEOUS JACKET. I don't know why it got 3 stars. Yes, its thin, but its not meant to keep you warm its meant to be fashionable. Also, it doesnt show you it looked closed. Theres a button up top and it goes across the neck, its really cute.",5
323032,"This ring was really cute, however it was so small that I had a lot of trouble getting it on my ear...and then I spent a good 30 min trying to get the ball in after finally getting it in my ear just to have the ball fall and get lost.",3
504663,Im honestly surprised at how much I really like this suit I really only got it because I just wanted some black high waisted bottoms although the sizing is a complete lie a large totally feels like a small so I would suggest you go a size up and the top is way to small it comes with a metal clasp on the back so you can't adjust it but all in all I love it like I said I bought it solely for the bottoms,4
724699,I wore this for the Disney Half Marathon at Disneyland in California. I wore a running shirt and running shorts underneath and it was perfect. Got lots of compliments while running. It was the easiest costume to put together for a long race. And I might wear it in the springtime with wedged sandals. Could be fun!,5
180707,"After following the advice to buy 2 sizes up, it still fits oddly. The sleeves are too snug and collar has two large extra ( unnecessary) flaps that can't be snapped down. Some type of metal stud is supposed to anchor or ineffectively weigh the lower flap, making it look a bit sillier than anticipated.",1
115479,"Cute dress but it does run a little small. I'm 5'6"" & about 165lbs. It's really nice looking on. I couldn't quite tell where I'm supposed to wear the dress, if it's best with the belt just below my bust or do I try to pull & stretch it to work with my natural waist line? Low cost, decent for a few wears I'd say.",3
100363,"This is 2 steps above all passport wallets/holders even twice the price. Slots for 4 cards, passport slot, and 2 extra pockets for cash or whatever else you need to put there. Protects my passport very well, and it's not as large as most passport holders- just a tiny bit larger than my wallet that I keep in my back pocket.",5
615880,"I love this dress because it's cute and comfortable. I bought it in 2 colors, pink and black and the black is true to description but the pink was a little off. I gave 4 stars only because the fabric is a little cheap feeling. Not enough for me to care, though. Especially not for the price. I plan on wearing these dresses all summer long and I will probably buy more for the inexpensive price that they are.",4
253811,"I was a bit skeptical about the quality of this wallet due to the price. All bad feelings were quickly washed away when this beauty came in. Perfect quality, nice and soft with many compartments. I love a purse, don't get me wrong, but a lot of times you don't feel like carrying around a big purse so you need a cute but semi big wallet! It fits my iPhone 6S, all my cards, cash, Chapstick, and lip gloss!",5
134386,"I like it.. I haven't worn it out yet but I did open the package and try it on for a brief second. I will be wearing it tomorrow probably.. and we'll see how it really looks out.. but as far as the fit.. I bought a large and thats what I normally wear so it was a little loose but in a good way kind of loose.. it was perfect bkuz I only wanted it for a summer,  everyday, throw on dress type thing..",3

The first one is red, and I've found myself using it every day, even when it clashes with the rest of my outfit.  Thus I've ordered the basic black.  It's such a convenient size, not too bulk to carry with me, and easy to access the various pockets.  I know this one will serve me well, too.",4
207212,"After waiting for almost a month for this blouse, I was very disappointed. The blouse is cheaply made and the x-large size looks more like a x-small. I usually wear a medium and so ordered a larger size to be safe. The sleeve on this blouse did not even make it past my elbow. I gave it to my daughter who is several sizes smaller than me, but the blouse did not fit her either. The blouse looks more like a little girl's 12-14 size.",1
96725,"I am so happy with this purchase. I feel like I'm barely wearing a sneaker when working out. Another plus is that when I take off my sneaker, my sock is barely sweaty! I have never had that experience with a shoe. The shoe is also very attractive and flattering and looks nice on my feet.",5
649878,"The chest was extremely tight on me and set very high on my waist.  I normally wear an XS/S in tops and a 2/4 in dresses, and this was still way too tight.  Also I wasn't thrilled with the quality.  It was your basic cotton dress.  No frills.",2
633398,This chest is beautiful. The picture doesn't do it justice.  It's well made and sturdy.  It's very well packed and heavy so be prepared to have a little difficulty maneuvering it as you unpack it.  I have gotten more compliments on this piece of furniture than anything I have ever owned.  My home is decorated in a beach theme and it fits perfectly at the same time adding a classy look with it's beautiful finish.,5
481438,"I had mt doubts when order this and it isn't anything spectacular or horrendous. It is a very thin cheap material, you may be going for that look though or just want a light sweater. It fits like a size small so be warned. I personally like this sweater, I can layer it and not be too hot.",3

There is an interior liner that is stitched in a triangular fashion, unfortunately, they aren't stitched in the right place, so that liner is going to either be removed completely, or the stitching needs modified. Otherwise, these are very fun, but the red color bleeds.",3
442982,"Material Sheds.  Leggings are not comfortable on the skin or to be in.  High top waist falls down or bunches up. Eww. Not cute.  The leggings are made out of material that makes you feel like plastic, you sweat you legs thighs everything for no reason because they don't breathe.",1
311946,"Perfect, and I have problem with hats and bandana's and such staying on my head without sliding off.  This stays put very well and is not a tight fit.  It does begin to look a little frayed or shaggy after a couple of wears though but nothing bad.",5
619939,"I'm 5'2"" 36/29/39 and this top in Medium is tight like a T shirt down to the waist. It is beautiful but just doesn't have as relaxed of a fit as I expected nor is it as long. I plan to order another one in XL to get a relaxed fit similar to the picture....otherwise everything about it is great! good quality fabric. The sleeves are beautiful and sheer  and the gray part is not see through at all. I definitely recommend this top!",5
607540,"I just received this swimsuit and I'm pretty impressed! I sized up (due to other reviews) and got a medium (in 5'4"" and about 115 lbs) and it fits pretty perfectly. the top is neoprene (or at least looks and feels like it) and fits very nicely. the only issue I had was the orange showed up a little too neon for my liking but was fine other than that. the bottoms are NOT neoprene (which I was a little upset about,) but are still pretty well made. overall I'm pretty pleased!",4
848523,I expected the top to be a bit large after reading others reviews....but for the price this is really a great suit.  My 6-year old loves it and she can wear it right over her mono-fin/mermaid tail she wears in the pool.  Really pretty mermaid-like color if you choose the green!,5
239204,Bought this set to wear at work since I'm a cosmetologist and didn't want to risk my real set going down the drain. I've now had it for a year and a half and it has held up beautifully. I shampoo hair 15-20x's a day and all of the stones are still there and it has no discoloration.,5
655796,"I love Nate. I've been a fan forever. Although I usually don't wear t-shirts or sweatshirts promoting artists or musicians, I felt like I had to in Nate's case. The material is very nice and sturdy, the ink print is resistant and sturdy as well, and the color are very vivid, but not as much as to blind you with their pigment. Fits perfectly, although the medium is a little big for me because it's unisex. I think it's meant to be oversized.",5
8405,"I expected these to be fitted, but as a ""one size fits all"" product, I did not expect them to be so tight at the top. I'm 5'4"" and 125 lbs and the top of these squeezed into my thighs giving me muffin tops on my legs...not at all flattering. I bought them for myself and a few friends (all a little bigger than me) to wear with tutus and no one will be wearing them.",1
18272,"I had this same hat from about 2 years ago and my little finally needed to size up. I was a little surprised how snuggly the 2T-4T fit after consulting the size chart before ordering. She has a larger head but is only 17 months. This size probably won't work next summer which is a bummer.

All that being said, I LOVE this hat! The string tie, adjustable head part, colors available, washability. Totally worth every penny! :-)",4
264994,"It came dirty whith what could be food or some sort of human fluids, completely disgusting. So I guess, what I got was something somebody else returned but Amazon didn't check how it was. It's terrible.
And it is somewhat small for an 18 month old baby. Not returning because it would cost me even more. I will wash it several times with hot water and hope for the best.
But I'm never buying Gerber's baby clothing ever again from Amazon.",1

The picture of R2D2 is clear, and the leggings are pretty long, fit better than expected. Delivery came when they said it would. Overall, worth it for the reason I needed them.",4
26014,"My podiatrist gave me a pair after diagnosing my Plantar fasciitis. I was in a lot of pain and didn't know if I'd have to stop running. These really helped, after wasting my money on the Dr, Scholls and other brands (which were useless) I now use them for running and also put a pair in my hiking boots.",5
314132,"Love them... looks so chic. Fits as expected. very true to size. I use 8. I was a little worry about the size so I took the risk ordering my normal size. Very strechy, love how it looks, exactly as picture. It doesnt lace domn when walking..I recommend to anyone to buy them. I bought a similar pair before to another seller and they didn't fit well. this ones are the hit.",5
130745,Reluctantly returning it. I suspect it would fit up to a size 16 or 18.(snugly) Just a hair too small for me. I loved it upon unwrapping. The sleeves were pretty narrow and the back was snug. I could just barely get the snaps closed but I looked like the hulk about to rip this poor beautiful light weight coat into shreds. I would have happily kept it if the size wasn't an issue though so I deducted no stars.  The embroidered skull was lovely. :),5

How can you have the shirts in that size but not the matching pants??!!!!!

SPIRAL GET IT TOGETHER!

I would rate better if you made other sizes!!!
Us curvy girls like your line too!! Start thinking about us!!!!

I have other clothing from you guys, and it fits great

Im an INBETWEENIE: is a person who can get away with wearing clothing considered for thin people. But also looks great in plus size clothing. Basically your neither thin nor plus sized.

PLEASE PUT UP OTHER SIZES SO ALL GIRLS OF ALL SIZES AND SHAPES CAN ENJOY YOUR LINE!! :(

402580,"Apparently not a great deal of film footage has survived this year. The whole thing lasts less than an hour so coverage is pretty short for each race. Picture quality is good. Also, there is no coverage at all of the last two races of the year. However it may me the only video coverage available of the championship year of the last American World Champion.

 I had difficulty playing this DVD on my regular player, but it played fine on my region free player. I believe it was marked Region 0.",3

Also its adjustable and washable. Good protection from direct sunlight. I can recommend this product to toddler 3 yrs and above.",5
870246,"I love this swim suit. I am 5'4, hover between 140-145 lbs. I bought size L and it fits perfectly. I thought it was going to be loose because I ordered a similar swim suit with boy shorts in size Large and it was too loose, so I had to give it to my sister and ordered myself a Medium. I can't understand they size discrepancy. This one in size L fits great.",5
101257,I'm keeping it because its cheaper than sending it back (!) but although the design is great the fabric has no stretch in it and is therefore shapeless - looks like school uniform.  Wish I could find this style from higher end manufacturer with stretch in.  Skirt is more A line than the pic shows.,2
139208,"I gave this as a gift.  It is so pretty, you can't believe that it was less than $10.  The material is beautiful and the bows are sewn on with clear buttons down the front, finished with a ruffle on both sides, even though it is sleeveless.  It fits true to size, the color is very nice and it is machine washable.  It was delivered 1 week from the day I purchased it.  I've never had anything from this brand, but I would surely buy from this seller  again.",5
348680,"I bought this for my hubby on our wedding anniversary, and he's a deer Hunter, loves camo, and just absolutely LOVES this ring. I couldn't believe the great quality of this ring, given that it was so affordable! Hubbys been wearing since I gave this to him a month ago.. the ring fits true to size, perfect fit. He was worried about wearing to work because he's a farmer and mechanic, but this ring has proven scratch proof! What an amazing deal for a quality peice, Thank you!",5
718634,"The item arrived in less than a week after I ordered it. I purchased a 2XL one and hoped that it was not be too large.  The jacket fit a tad tight, so if you order this jacket go a size up.  The jacket is beautiful but it has a musky smell probably because it was in a plastic bag for an extended period.  This jacket is a nice addition to my Negro League attire.",5
718020,"This is cute but I can't wear it. It's way to big and hangs down too far. Also the stone isn't quite as turquoise as the picture shows, it's a little greener than the picture. If it was smaller I would definitely wear it. I'm pretty bummed that I cant.",3
52544,It's cute.  My 7-month old's head circumference is at 50% and she fits in it with no problem.  I think she can still fit in the hat when she's 1.  The hat has a little band inside to allow adjustment for the hat to fit the baby's head.,5
699704,"Bought this for my wife who is due this October. We are huge GOT fans so she was thrilled when she opened her gift. It fit her great out of the package, but I would buy one size larger because it shrank drastically after I washed and dried it. I doubt she will be able to wear it towards the very end of her pregnancy. The drastic shrinking is the reason I give this shirt 4 out of 5 stars.",4
351399,"Terrible fabric, looks and feels very cheap. Not see through though. Stitch work sucks. Waist band is thick (in a good way) holds everything in well. I could get way better leggings at Walmart or the dollar store for either the same or probably less. I ordered both light blue and light grey.",2
339387,Not very happy that this is a knitted thin cardigan instead of the crochet looking sweater as it seemed in the first 2 pictures. Wish I'd read the reviews and looked at the last few pictures of what this item really looks like before I purchased. It is soft though and fits in my true size.,1
665609,"I am so sad I couldn't keep it, My Lenovo pro 13"" unltrabook wouldn't fit by the tiniest of margins.  The top of the bag is slightly more narrow than the  bottom so when you look at the measurements, take that into consideration.  I thought the feel and look were great.  Hate to send it back, but need something that will fit my computer.  Oh, and there was no strong odor at all as was mentioned in some posts.",5
835826,works good for a swimsuit cover-up but wouldn't wear it away from the water. It is lined with swimsuit liner but it doesn't go all the way down - on me the liner is just barely long enough to cover my small butt. it kind of looks odd because it isn't long enough so you see where the liner ends.,3
578850,"My daughter stats: 6 years old, 4'1"" tall and about 70lbs (looks like a 9 years old) and I ordered medium.

Comfortable, fitted but it shrank after the first wash.  The fabric used are super soft and 100% cotton.  Great as undershirt or as is for little girls.  My 6 years old likes to wear a short denim bolero over these undershirts.  I would recommend and planning to buy one size up but is now currently unavailable.",4
277673,I've purchased quite a few waist cinchers and this one by far has the best fit.  I ordered my size based on the measurements and it fit fine.  It didn't roll up  like some of the others in the past.  I've only worn it three times so far and my waist was 32.5 inches when I started.  (all during the workday) I will check it again in a few weeks.,5
816160,"It's fit generally as expected in my opinion. When you receive this in the mail though, check it for weird blotches or colors that aren't supposed to be there. The first one I ordered had weird brown spot on it, but they gave me full refund. The second one I ordered was just fine!",4
195791,"American Indian motif, including tribal regalia worn in dancing ceremonies, form the patterns on the cloth.  Attractive print, but use discernment so that you are not unwittingly opening up invitations to spirits of ancestors.  I did not carefully view the print when ordering and when it arrived, even though the colors and design were attractive and flattering in the mirror, I would not wear due to spiritual ""conflict of interest.""  Love all American Indians.  Just cannot get into the spiritual liaison of the dances.",1
452758,"I haven't worn these a whole lot, but they have held up and they fit nicely. As good (if not better) than what I'd find at a convenience store, and the polarization adds a subtle color swirl to my otherwise meaningless life as a multi-cellular organism hopelessly floating on a wet rock through time and space on the back of a one-eyed rainbow-snake butterfly tongue.

Cosmic.",5
280238,I love these sandals because you can adjust them all over.  If you feet might swell you can just adjust the straps.  It adjust even down to the toe area and in the back and ankle area.  I get a lot of compliments on these shoes.  They are very comfortable too.,5
698130,"It doesn't look like the pic and doesn't fall the way it looks like does so not good to get unless you have a flat stomach and the openings for your shoulders are smaller than I expected. I might have been too big for it. I got the biggest size available and i am 5' 5"" and about 160 lbs.",3
364832,"I got tired of buying these and they always turn out too small. I am 5'4"" 165 and heavy on top, but not so much on the bottom. I remedy this problem by re-sewing them to fit like a regular pantie. Save your money unless you want to do what I did or if you are just petite.",2
493863,"This shirt is SMALL and TIGHT. I bought this for my boyfriend not thinking that since it was coming from Asia that it might come smaller than expected. I also did not realize that it was going to be a somewhat spandex-y material. Anyone considering buying a cheeseburger shirt, go ahead and spend the money on the more expensive shirt. Not this one!",2
445996,"If you want yellowish ball studs with just a tiny touch or rose then these are satisfactory. However, they'd I not look anything close to the rosiness of the product image. And like the first reviewer mentioned, the balls are hollow. The backs are so tiny -- the tiniest of any earrings I've ever bought anywhere -- to be worthless. I already chucked them and am using the backs of other earrings.

In short, these earrings are okay. Would I buy them again? Not if I wanted rosy earrings, no.",3
738416,"The picture does NOT represent the item that was delivered. It's is definitely not the same fabric as depicted in the image, but more of a heavy t-shirt fabric. Also, the neck is just this added flap on top of the shirt, doesn't look a think like what was represented. I am VERY disappointed.",1
279807,"I really wanted to like this. The print is cute and for all intensive purposes, it looks good out of the package. But the fit... Not good. I'm 5'4, have a slender build and weigh about 121 lbs. The shorts are SHORT. And tbh, that doesn't even bother me that much. It's the riding up of them. Just not super comfy. I suppose I could have ordered a size up... but then the top part would have been too big.",2
719493,"Fabric looks a little cheap, but sturdy. I like the overall color. Looks like the teal in the picture. The only problem I would find is that it came broken. One of the straps wasn't attached which is a not disappointing but fixable. The zipper you have to be gentle with. I love the zipper charm.",3
764993,Make no mistake this is a snug fit. I assumed it needs to be so to perform the task it's designed for. Once you develop a way to get it on it fits and wears well and does promote positive posture. I did notice that it's a little more snug under the arms than I was expecting but again to do its job I believe it has to be.,4
650151,"I really like it. It is very form fitting and although it is stretchy, it seems kinda tight around the belly. I wonder how much longer it will fit without looking too thin. It is a little thin, I have to coordinate my underwear well or it will show through.",4
416686,Well built and pretty ring. The only thing I would watch out for would be that it does have 7 stones and so the side two stones will be in contact with your other fingers. This irritates me and I find myself turning the ring over during the day but if you are not quite so fidgety as I am it may not be a problem.,4
396025,"Could not be happier with an online dress purchase. Just as described. Right length - I got an M and am 5-4 and 135 lbs. Hope it won't shrink. Not see through. I did need a tank under it. The top portion is a bit loose but even the online pictures show that. The material is soft and falls nicely, does not look like cheap polyester at all.",5
861615,"This dress is so much better than I had hoped. the fabric is slinky and flows nicely. Very flattering. I'm 5'1"" and about 150lbs. I ordered the large and it fits perfect. I plan on wearing this with cognac colored booties, but surprisingly enough, it is the perfect length even if I wanted to wear flip flops.",5
59430,This case works for people who have to travel with contact lens and eye glasses!  I wear RGP and sometimes I have to take them out for various reasons and resort to my glasses.  This is an excellent product except for 1 thing: the lens case and the slot to hold the case is shaped with a curve making it impossible to use a standard size lens case holder.,4

However, I had to use a 5VDC power supply that I already possessed to supply power.
The USB cable supplied had a bad connection to the unit and could only get the LEDs to momentarily flicker.
Battery power worked fine, but they only illuminated 4 LEDs.",4
75779,This is great to extend your clothing for a short time while pregnant. I bought it later on in my pregnancy so I didn't get as much use out of it as I could have but I would recommend it. Once you wear maternity pants there is no going back. They are so comfortable!,4
292279,Just like the ones that cost 90.00. ! Better off getting this brand over an overrated expemsive brand. Literally just got it and now im tyling this review while i wear it. Its just what ive been wanting for so long. I thought i was never gonna get one since they're so over priced everywhere. 10/10 must get yourself one. Dont waste money buying a known brand when you can just buy this specific one!!,5
430042,"A lot of reviews commented on the small earring back, personally I love it.  I wear in my 2nd pierce so the small back is great.  I lost my CZ earring I had worn in my 2nd pierce for about 34 years.  My husband tells me he cannot tell the difference from my original one.  Great earrings at a great price, very happy!",5
220022,This necklace was a gift for my daughters friend. She was so excited to give it to her friend. Usually when you buy these trinket necklaces they are not worth it but this one is totally different. Its pretty Nice! I am really pleased with the shipping and the customer service provided by the seller. I am delighted to share positive feedback so other know this is a great gift item.,5

First I want to make a note that GUESS is very quick at getting their shipments out. I ordered these yesterday (8/5/13) at 5:30PM-MT and they got here in 18 hours! At first I love them, they fit great, they look amazing! This is not my first Guess purchase, I have their Seductive Cologne which is also amazing.

657567,"This bag really needs a shoulder strap.  The person they have modeling it must be a very tiny person because she seems to conjure the illusion that one can easily slide the bag onto the shoulder but in reality the handles are very small dimension and you cannot get it onto the shoulder.  If you are carrying heavy items be prepared to handle the weight with your hand.  I've always wanted a patent leather tote, and I was excited about getting this one, but now I'm rather disappointed.  Its just a really large pocketbook.",1
754972,Has no stretch whatsoever. Does not fit over my boobs and i usually wear a medium in tops. That is the size i got so i was surprised when it was too small for my chest. :( Cute top for smaller boobs i guess. Hopefully I can adjust it because i would like to wear it.,3

I will say the color fades and changes over time.....I wear mine daily so they get truly tested.  If they came in more colors I'd probably get them all!",5
375852,"Pretty disappointed in this item it's much smaller than the discription and images lead me to believe. Will be returning.

Also for anyone looking to figure out how to put it together you take the spare strap they give you and feed it through the shoulder ""o"" rings then cross it over your chest ending with securing it behind your beck to create the pentagram design.",2
334933,"I love these shoes. I have a wide-ish foot and big calves. So I always have to worry about ankle booties rubbing around my ankles/being too tight. These were not! They were comfortable and fit me like a glove. They are a LITTLE bit noisy (clack clack), but I like that . I mostly wear a 9.5, maybe sometimes a 9, but I bought a 10 in attempts that it would be wider for me, and it was!",5
118828,"I love this but I bought it for my middle finger and it's a smidge too tight. It works on my ring finger, but that wasn't my intention. Recommend you go up a size since this isn't available in half sizes and it is two rings going around your finger and compressing it. Much different to a typical one-loop ring.",5
132787,I like the material. It is warm and fuzzy and washes well. On me they are about mid knee so i wear them just to the bottom of my knee. There is no way they would be over the knee except on a petite woman. I still like them for the colors and warmth.  I would recommend and would buy again.,4
76019,"Just starting my second trimester and I love this BellaBand.  I was going to go with a cheaper brand but decided after reading reviews that I should just invest in this one.  Worth the money, has made my work pants (which I can no longer button) fit longer, and I don't even know if I'll end up buying maternity pants in the near future at all!",5
641856,"I ordered a medium and it was way too small. I am 5'3"" 120 pounds and i usually wear a small or xsmall with everything so i ordered a medium. The medium was still really small. Knowing the fit now, I would have ordered an x large top and a large bottom, but i don't think you can order different sizes. Cheap material, but for the cost, it is good. It shipped to me very quickly.",2
308474,"This is beautiful bracelet watch but know that it is big. Not only in terms of the size of the design (which is beautiful) but the wrist size. There is nothing to adjust the wrist size. I am 5.3 ft with 125 lbs weight so my wrist is not too thin but It was very loose on my wrist so did not do justice to its beauty. I gave it away to someone who has a thicker wrist size.
The color is more of a rose gold with pearls and crystals on it.",4
868412,"Hat fit exactly as expected, but must be a Costa reject or knock-off - NO WAY PASSED COSTA'S QUALITY CONTROL.  Front panel is Tan, not White or Off-White like I was expecting, but not a deal breaker for me.  My major issue is that the Logo has Grey streaks through the Red/White/Blue - See picture.  Extremely disappointed in my purchase",1
232282,"They fit fine, but if my calf was any bigger you would see through some of the knit. I'm 5'5"", 135lb (athletic build). They took awhile to come, but not any longer than indicated at the time of purchase. That's what you get when you a buy a product that gets shipped from China.",4
574434,"Cut and style as pictured. Size 2xl equivalent to American medium.  Fabric felt similar to felt, soft, not sure how durable as I returned it. It looked a bit more orange than the nice salmon/orange pictured. I am an athletic/fit build and I looked huge and orange in it.  I would recommend for petite orange lovers.",2
95328,"When I first received this, I was thrilled with it, but now it has turned black and nasty. I've tried jewelry cleaner, silver cleaner and baking soda but it still looks nasty. I had my last silver chain for years and a little cleaning with baking soda would restore it to new. Unfortunately this one didn't even last a few months.",1
156505,"Had I seen this product in the store the way it arrived to me, I would not have bought it. It was scratched all over the top. I wondered if I received a re-box. I decided I would live with it. I hope it lives up to the intent with which I purchased. I'm curious what it would look like with a clean nickel finish. Still, it is really fun to pull out of your purse to grab your card. That's the reason for 4 stars!",4
460739,Love the bag great fit awesome how it holds its shape but DEAR GOD GIVE A SLIDING PADDED STRAP. The way I wear it the damn pad is pushed over the shoulder towards the chest. With a sliding pad like the 5.11 rush it would be amazing. Give me a sliding pad sling,4
139161,"It's from Hong Kong where the sizes are different, so definitely order a size larger than you'd normally order. It's great, soft material and definitely durable. Not see-through at all which is a giant plus. Not sure if it will shrink in the dryer, though. And i'm not willing to to try that out. definitely hang dry! but absolutely adorable",5
20036,I bought this for my 6 month old.  It fits well and it's nice that you can adjust the size around his head.  The only downside is the drawstring that you pull to size is in an uncomfortable spot on the hat.  It is right in the back so if your child was in his carrier or carseat it would be pressing in the back of his head.,4
540285,the size is very compact.. fits nicely in back pocket... and plenty of room in zipper pocket for essentials.... The color is gorgeous and the quality it great. As far as blocking i have no idea...  i trust the claims are real... they are a company of  integrity.,5

I saw these Nicole Miller frames at my eye doctor's office for over $200 and liked them very much, but could not afford them, so I looked online at Amazon and found the exact same frames for $39.99!  I ordered them and when they arrived I took them to my eye doctor to get the sunglasses lenses put in.  The frames are sturdy, they look wonderful (modern & stylish), fit great and I will be glad to get them back as soon as they are ready!",5
178137,"Bought the dress for less than $7, got a large because I read so much about it being tight especially in the bust/waist. I wear a DD and usually a medium size top, and I have athletic arms, it was a little loose on me, but very comfortable. Shipping was very quick from Asia, my only complaint is that it was a little short (I'm 5'5).",4
502412,This product was huge. It wouldn't even stay on my hips. I usually run within a small to medium. I got a medium and it was huge I felt like an xs was in need. I would suggest to order your actually size on clothing and not go by the chart.,3
580080,"Love the fabric and the cut, but the waist is a little unforgiving due to the stitching.  I haven't washed them yet, so will be curious to see how that goes.  I could have easily rated these 5 stars but for the waist (and I need to see how they hold up.)",4
360715,"The clothes are adorable, but I ordered a 0 to 3 month size and I received a newborn size. Newborn isn't an option on the size chart but apparently when you select 0 to 3 months they consider that newborn.
I'm not sending them back because they do fit her for now, but it is frustrating because I was hoping she could wear them slightly to. If right now and then grow into them and get more time out of them.",3

680463,"The ""dress"" is so cute and the blue looks so amazing with the white. The pattern is also very nice and elegant. The one thing I don't like is that it's not a dress, it's more like a long shirt. Which is alright.. It's super short, definitely can't pass as a dress. I do like it though just be prepared if you do purchase it!",5
480870,Beautiful! Love the bling and the design! The only things I would suggest is to make sure to keep it away from a thick sweater/top it could get caught it. Also it doesn't hurt to make sure the jewel are secured in before wearing to avoid losing any. I am in love with this and enjoyed wearing this ',5
407748,"Tend to stretch easy but a simple warm/cold wash fixes that. Get more compfy after a couple of uses, fallen asleep more then once wearing them lol. Use them more to stay warm vs looks. Very simple layering that helps on those colder days! Lost a star due to the easy stretching but yet I'm kinda hard on them...",4

Dont size up. Get your size",3
59250,"I ordered this wallet in hopes to buy something that is fun and long-lasting. Unfortunately, the material is very cheap and flimsy. I started transferring my cards from my old wallet to this one and I was already afraid of it ripping. The ""leather"" on the outside is also not very pleasing. And on top of it all, there is no ID slot for you to be able to view your drivers license/ID, which seems pretty inconvenient to me. This product would last a month or two, tops. Really disappointing. The wallet is very cool-looking, but not worth the risk.",3
878100,"I love this dress. The fabric so so soft and it fits well. I got a large and it's kind of short but the back of it is a little longer so it's not too bad. definitely need to wear a slip because it's pretty see through when you pull it tight. I'm 5'7"" and it's a touch short but other than that it's fantastic!",5
135167,"These are pretty, silky and feminine panties.  Their colorful pastels are attractive.  As another reviewer commented they are a very good choice for men who enjoy wearing smooth and comfortable women's attire.  I feel sorry for all those males that limit themselves to wearing unattractive and uncomfortable boxers or briefs.  These sateen panties are as liberating as they are comfortable.",5
328300,So the dress fit okay. isn't a stretchy material. the arms were tight and it was tight around my boobs and butt but VERY loose around my waist so i have to get it taken in. but the fabric is true to the picture. if you have a butt the skirt rides up so you have to keep pulling it down,3

I was offered these tools at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.",5

Update 1/6/18

We have repaired the chain 3 times in one year. My fianc loves this necklace but its absolutely ridiculous how this chain just breaks. Also note that the chain is not breaking from pulling or being roughly handled.",1
15120,I've used these insert for the last 10 years and they work awesome. They are more expensive then some other brands but they last for a long time! Depending on which shoes I use them in they have lasted easily for 3 years still having all their arch support. I'd definitely recommend to anyone. I use them for my flat feet and it definitely helps my back and feet fell better.,5
502113,"I purchased an XL hat. Was misshapen in the box. Fit too big (I usually order a size up from normal as I have a larger head). That's fine though I sold it to a friend who really liked it and didn't mind the permanent dents and bends. I purchase a second one, size large. It fits perfectly. Though it was even worse shappened than the first one. Completely disappointed and dissatisfied. Added pictures are the first hat and the second hat. Hats were not delivered in their advertised condition.",1

I made the buy the 7 of December and yesterday I received the product. I checked the tracking number and the shipment was held on January 10, more than one month later of the purchase... Finally the product is not the best.",1
740696,"This is a beautiful prop, but I could only wear it for pictures as it is so very heavy! I also had to bend it this way and that to fit me and stay on. Another problem was that when I received it, the front jewel was partially covered with hardened glue. I contacted the seller for advice on these issues and did not receive a reply.",3
232158,I got these for my cartilage and I didn't know what my gauge is so I bought these. (same size as a standard ear ring) I only have one in but they are perfect and I sleep with it in my ear: you'll just need some help putting the ball on!,5
164707,"Very see through. The waist band is good, very thick, supportive around the waist but the leggings are very Thin, like nylon material!!! No one could workout in these unless you wear a long long shirt, even then they feel so thin theyd rip at a sudden move ! Did I get a bad pair because I feel like the reviews compared them to lululemons !! Not even close!",1
44604,"A fun boot for winter with longer dresses and skirts.  Look a little trendy, but, are better in bad weather than leathers--no worry about wet or salt, as they wipe clean.

Will show some marks where boots may rub together, but all patent leather does.

Worth the price for a no-worries, funky boot.",5
879988,"Very comfortable and very sexy. The back straps stay put and the front package keeps things in place. After ordering the first just to see how it fit and felt, I ordered five more. Total of four black and two white. Caution - if you get the white wet, everyone will see whats underneath the material as the it becomes sheer. My girlfriends love it!",5
418086,"Fits perfect, item as described couldn't be happier. I just want everyone to know they should have there measurements taken before hand if they don't know it. Anyways love the Kakadu brand quite a bit this is a great hat with great stitching I may have to buy another one for my friend, for the price and looking so good.",5
690746,"Tiny bit large but a very pretty dress, may need a slightly puffier petticoat than the one recommended with this. Also, I'm 5'7 and it's about a knee length, so keep in mind any slips or petticoats will need to be longer. I otherwise thought it was very pretty and wore it to a New Year's outing.",4
303382,I hve been wearing this ring now for a month and I have to say it looks as nice as the day I received it from Amazon.  The back that gets wear is scratched but since it is sterling you really do not notice.  The size is very realistic and I get compliments from people who think this is a diamond ring.,5

This spirit hood is amazing, and you'll get compliments for days whenever you wear it to your favorite rave. However, I've now used four of these hoods between my brothers and I and all four of them have stopped changing color or having problems after only being used two to three times.",3
469158,"Tight around the shoulders, loose around the waist. Length was just above the knee.  The location of the belt loops was just a tad too high. All around a very odd fit.

I think it'd fit someone with a pear or banana body shape very well.  Hour glass, busty or tall girls should beware.

I am 5'7 and 125 lbs.  Wear a size 4-6, got the XL.

The detail in collar and hem was nice though.",3
448020,"I'm 5'6'', 112 lbs. U.S size 2. The Small fits perfectly and the sleeves provide enough room for you to wear layers underneath such as a thick sweater. I prefer trench coats to be a little more fitted in the arm area so i'll probably take it in some, however the waist is well fitted. It has a hint of a shine to it but nothing to be worried about. Its slightly thinner than the other trench coats I own but the quality is exceptional for the price. It's certainly worth it! :) do buy!",5
791,I've tried these on a few times before buying them. I must have tried different standard white v-necks as one medium seems to fit a lot tighter (which is desired for an undershirt) than others. I bought another two sets from Marshalls and they appeared to be the exact same product but fit a lot looser. They are very comfortable and I kept both.,5

Seriously tho, if you are looking at these, then get them. They're exactly what they look like, and sturdy, and don't scratch easy!",5
722869,The maker of this dress clearly doesn't have a conception of 3xl size in the US I was highly dissapointed. Fortunately my Neighbor could fit the dress so I gave it to her she is a size 14. The look on her face said it all and I was happy to have made her day.....,2

Light as a feather, but warm as toast yesterday in 17 degree wind. It starts warming up the instant that you put it on. I'm so glad that I chose it. Will be ordering another color. There so many colors to chose from!",5
745748,"Very nice quality jacket. Nice long sleeves, the leather is soft. Super cool looking but the fit is off. I think these may be junior sizes. It was way too narrow in the shoulders and arms. I ordered an XL and it fit like a medium. Ended up giving it to my much-tinier 15 yr old daughter and it looks great on her and she loves it so at least wasn't a waste.",4
859724,"I just received this insect dress this evening. It's such a fun and vibrant dress, but the collar can be improved.
The dress itself has buttons from head to toe, and I wish the collar would fall flat for a more relax yet refined look. With this style, it looked sloppy around the neck.
I ordered this in size Small. I'm 5 feet and weight 103 pounds. The dress hit slightly above my knees.",4
488875,"The listing said this runs a size small...more like two full sizes or more.  I am a size large (12) right now since having my second child.  I ordered this in an extra large and I couldn't even pull it up over my legs.  It looked like a size small.  Yes, I understand that this is a shapewear garment and should be snug, but really, this was ridiculous!  I gave it two stars because it did look pretty well made.",2
565136,"The shirt weight is very heavy and stiff, like the free shirts you get for promotional items when you fill out a credit card application or something.

The tank top did not over lap the waste string at all. Just looked like i took a string and tied it around my waste.
Top was not proportion correctly.",1
582786,"Alright - first, I love Amazon.  We ordered this dress for my daughters upcoming Military Ball.  It looks very pretty in the picture.  It arrived and what a disappointment.  It looks like a $15 cheapo wedding dress.  Sending it back.  Don't waste your time.  There are better dresses on Amazon.",1
102660,"I was searching for some casual blouses to wear for everyday, so I came to Amazon. Fortunately I was able to find this pretty 3/4 Sleeve Poplin Blouse,  I placed it in my ""wish list"" and the next thing I know I had a pleasant surprise at my front door! My husband had (secretly) browsed my wish list and purchased!! It fit so well & was so comfortable he ordered 2 more for me in different colors as a surprise!! Yes...I am a very blessed woman!!!",5

He loves this dress form and has asked me to order another one for him at some point. It's pretty and elegant...although a little flimsy. It arrived kind of bent out of shape, but he was able to fix it.",5

280626,No complaints so far. I was replacing a pair of vionic flip flops I had. I just felt I wasn't getting the same support from them. I opted for the heel strap because I struggle with plantar faciitis. This way I have a bit more stability. I've only worn them once but I was able to wear them standing 8 hours as a hairstylist with no problems.,5
487919,"Recipient seemed happy with them.
One of the posts was bent when they arrived but it was an easy fix.
Nice stocking stuffer - if you buy these you shouldn't expect high-end. These are marked as costume jewelry and they are just that.
Not a ding on the product. They are pretty and worth the price paid.",4
296830,"I bought a size small for this swimsuit. I am 5'3"" and weight 125 pounds. The swimsuit is somewhat short in length and wide in girth.  The pads sit low as a result of the overall shortness.  If I yank it up enough,  it  looks really cute. The quality is good for the price I paid.  If the pads are removed it is actually a really cute one piece.",3

I've tried charging it over and over, but it always says that it's 90% charged. The directions are descriptive enough, either. I've given up on this watch and will now switch to the Garmin Forerunner.",2
358807,"These mittens have Velcro strips that go around the wrist. Seems great at first but after a couple wears and washes (maybe five) the Velcro begins to curl out causing baby to get ""stuck""on blankets, you, crib etc. I always washed these in a laundry bag to protect Velcro. Unfortunately I bought three pair. What an expensive disaster!",1
386233,"When I saw those skirt on amazon I had to have it. When it arrive it looked exactly like the picture,beautiful navy flowers. The fabric was very light weight cool. I gave it to my grandaghter she is a six and I'm a size 16 .It came to knee length. The skirt is stretchy, very beautiful. The size I ordered was 2x so it runs kinda small.",1

43229,"I bought a blue one for my little boy and a pink one for my little girl, and they're sturdy and great at protecting kids from the rain, due to its enveloping dome-shaped style. These last longer because when the wind kicks up, the umbrellas don't suddenly invert, leaving you with a wet and rain-soaked kid. I call them my jellyfish squad when they're walking together. Great product.",5
19434,"My darling, pale Irish baby girl needs any and all protection from the sun. This has a nice wide brim all around, and you can loosen or tighten the crown so it stays on nice and snug. My daughter doesn't usually try to take it off. I feel better when we're outside and she's wearing it.

The color is beautiful. The picture doesn't really show its vibrancy.",5
253615,"This is a very attractive wristlet.  The color was very similar to that depicted online. Plenty of room for cards, cash, and coins.  My iPhone 6S was a tight fit in the middle compartment, with a slim case on the phone. Not sure a phone larger than this would fit. I removed one star for the horrible smell...even 2 weeks later it is still quite noticeable. The smell seems to be from the material on the inside of the wristlet...it is like a bad plastic/burning smell.",4
3194,Its a cute costume except I should've listened to the reviews before buying... the top part was a bit big and the boot covers kept falling off when I tried it on. I couldn't wear it for Halloween unfortunately. I should've ordered a size smaller :( Maybe I will do that next year.,2
253328,I actually liked this very much.  It does have a very strong leather-ish smell. the color is awesome!  It feels like it's made with really strong material.  I break everything I owe... I am rough on things. Hopefully it will last.  It seems like I will get a year out of it... which is rare,5
424643,"Overall it is OK.  There are a few changes I would make.  First, there is no separate change compartment.  Second, I would have liked a longer strap.  Third, the snap on the front pocket is poorly made.  I really expect this to tear out.  I find the credit cards difficult to remove, but that could just be me.",3
379967,"These are so cozy that I not only use them for yoga but also for regular use just around the house and such. They are very soft, cozy, and non slip. They have little tiny rubber grips on the bottom so safety first. No slip comes in handy for yoga. I love these. they are super convenient and cuuuuute.",5
764910,super cute and mine fit as expected although if you cant wear certain metals i don't recommend this purchase but for those of us who can it was great... I know the size can be an issue for some people with this style so if you have larger ears it won't fit UNLESS you have your ears pierced more than once and can position the pin higher up,5
81974,"I wasn't expecting much when I ordered this item.  I assumed it would look and feel cheap, which it does not.  It's quite heavy, the detail is impressive and it seems to keep time well.  It came with the correct time already set and also included a spare battery.  I purchased it to wear with a Halloween costume but I will definitely wear it with other attire.",5
340946,I purchased these because you can not find black lula roe leggings.  They are ok.  I don't care for the shiny material.  I was hoping for something a little softer.  The waist band is such that it slides down.  The length was a little long but easily adjustable,3
314373,"These shades are pretty bad ass. I had bought them, along with some others to try on before a rave. I have to say that this product tops the competition. The light up white stunner shades are just the trick to bring in the attention with the ladies. Battery-life is superb, and the color matches well with any club attire. A+ product, I would recommend again!",5
484398,"i would buy this again, and again and again. i ordered a medium 10/12. im about 5'4, 130 lbs, and busty. i loooove it. it fits just right and is warm and comfy. only slightly disappointed that it came in more of a red rather than a ""wine"" type shade. but still would buy again. :D",5

Disappointed to say the least. Not up to Amazon standards.",1
392612,"I bought these yoga socks for my daughter and she totally loves them. They come in four fun colors and have just enough ""grippy"" spots on the bottom to make them work well at the studio where she takes classes.  They are stretchy enough to fit well without being too tight or uncomfortable. She either takes classes or assists in teaching them almost every day, so they'll get quite a workout!

More colors please!

I'm rather small breasted and don't need much support from bras, so I decided to try out Nudwear's Daisies. I've worn them everyday since they arrived! I can wear them under anything - the reusable adhesive nipple covers are made from second skin matte silicone giving you the smoothest most seamless coverage.  I love them and I will purchase them again!",5
5607,"I have owned several pairs of these pants throughout the years. I have often purchased them through local stores as well as Amazon, using the same serial or model number-whatever you want to call it. The material Carhartt has started using is rougher and stiff, probably more durable but the old kind was soft and more comfortable. The fit is still the same which I like, but the texture/rigidity of them is annoying.",3

The straps/sleeves are so wide, I didn't feel uncomfortable at all. So, I skipped wearing a cardigan, like I normally would have. The dress is very flattering and I would absolutely recommend to anyone, especially plus size ladies, for a cute summer dress.",5
160770,It is exactly what I expected. The only down side is that the ring that connects the upper part to the lower didn't hold for long. I have had to put it back together 4 or 5 times already. The key is to not do anything too active while wearing this. Sitting or bending puts strain on the chain and it won't hold. Otherwise it looks great and was a great price!!,4

133343,"This is so perfect for my son.  Granted, my 6 month old is a little short, but this goes all the way to his ankles.  I love that it covers so much of his little body, which means I will only have to put sunscreen on his face, hands, and feet.  The quality of the fabric and the design are awesome.  Plus, the colors are super cute.  I can't wait to get to the pool with him this summer!",5
299182,"So far, so good! I researched how to wear the waist trainer. So far, I am wearing it on the first clasp set and only for 2-4 hours a day. It is not uncomfortable as I would have thought...I actually like the feeling of wearing it. I was intimidated by the amount of clasps when I first saw it but they are so easy to clasp it is a non factor...I am moving my clasps next week and adding an hour, will edit if things change.",5

I ordered these hoping to like them and they fit great, were comfortable but the color was all wrong.  The brown is a weird color and almost reminded me of a color an elderly person would wear.  Sent them back.",3

The blouse is packaged in a small plastic bag and it has a tag. It looks very elegant and is flattering with a simple skirt.

I ordered mine in Small. It fits perfectly! It is long enough to be worn with trousers or a skirt.",5
194954,"This is a stunner.  Lots of presence for a small price.  This could be worn in most offices, casual or dressy.  It would be great for prom or a special evening out, but I'll wear it with jeans.  Because of all the colors it'll go with nearly anything.  It has a lobster claw clasp so it'll be easy to adjust the length, and while it's a large piece, it's not huge.  And at this price, you can give it to all of your daughter's friends for Christmas.",5
314466,"Definitely not the worst dress I've put on. The fabric is nice and thick and I love the skirt length. The collar part is kind of weird I couldn't figure out how it was supposed to look until I looked at the photos of the product again. Also, you'll definitely want an iron if you're going to purchase this. I am a size 2x, so that's the size I ordered. It's slightly tight but not so much that I can't wear it. I got the wine red color for a valentine date dress and the color is spot on.",4

We reordered a small that is labeled a 6/7 and it fits great.  This shirt runs small order a size up from what you need.,5

Very disappointed, I will be returning this.",1

I have no choice but to return... otherwise I've purchased a dress to send to Goodwill.",1

I strongly recommend you to take in consideration this remark in order you stop offering things that do not fit to reality.",1

I had to be mindful to keep my legs crossed at the knee or ankle. 3. THE SEQUINS WILL RUIN YOUR ARMS! Maybe not a big deal if you won't be in the room for a while. My inner biceps were irritated and scratched after a night out. Not the end of the world, but something I didn't consider about the dress.",4

It fit immediately.  I was thrilled and send it with her to daycare to protect her little bald head!",5

813808,"As a gift to a friend, the shirt is very soft against the skin and I love the powder blue color, when he tried it on,  it contoured to the shape of his masculine body which looked very nice as the size was an XXL because of the slim fit style.  I would purchase more shirts from the seller. The package was nicely snugged but the only thing I didn't like was it was full of wrinkles. I purchased this product for a discounted rate to write this review but will purchase this nice shirt at regular price.",5
314438,"Does not look like the picture as advertised. For $20, the yarn material has very shiny synthetic cheap feel the and workmanship is desperately lacking; threads coming out and woven crooked.

744358,Great bracelet!  Fits perfect.  Durable also. I wore it for four days straight sleeping in it and worked in it and moved and nothing was damaged. I have a lot of friends with pugs and Im going to order a few more of them for gifts. Theyre perfect for gifts and the price is right.  Its absolutely an adorable bracelet and an excellent value.

He is still a little small for it, but for what I wanted to use it for, it was perfect. It even comes with a detachable lunch box for my babe :)",5
221171,"I looked at reviews before buying these socks.  I usually find that socks are just too big, especially after wearing them a few hours.  I bought these because reviews said they are on the small side....and they are!!  These fit GREAT.  Thanks to the reviewers who said so.",4
311637,"Shoes seemed to hold up for about a month on this 3 year old then the Velcro strap came off.  I stitched it back on.  Lasted longer then the Disney shoes we bought from JcPennys.  Fit was very good as advertised, part of the reason I bought them.",4
124009,"Very form fitting.  I orderd a size large based on the reviews I read.  I normally would wear a size medium.  Definitely shows off my curves.  I needed to wear Spanx under it to smooth out my tummy area, but then again I always wear Spanx.",4
599137,"The medium fit my daughter. ( size C cup). I ordered a size S for my daughter, but received a medium. Too much trouble to send back. I had ordered my other daughter a medium(she ended up with 2 bras). They were delivered on seperate dates in seperate boxes. She likes the fit and says they are supportive.",5
82143,"This is a perfect pencil case. I was looking for a large pencil case to perfectly fit all of my items, which includes four dry erase markers, four highlighters, and multiple pencils and pens. This case does the job perfectly. In the past I have loved Herschel products because they are so durable and they last a very long time and I imagine this product will as well. Don't hesitate to buy!",5
400669,"I have 2 sizes in Swiss Army & love it! However the last one purchased which is a 26"" ""spinner"" tips over easily when fully packed without a hand on the handle. Annoying. I don't know if the wheel placement on the ""spinner"" is different but we have owned Victorinox Swiss Army luggage for years (never a spinner) & never encountered this problem. It is made very well & has very useful compartments. Would purchase again, however, if purchasing a ""spinner"", I would consider a different brand.",4
141107,"If the handle drop were just a couple of inches more this bag would be perfect! I love it though! It is beautiful, looks rich. I love the color (I chose the navy blue). The bag is dressy enough for work, but looks great with jeans for the weekend. This was my first Scarleton bag, and will not be my last!",4
425470,"I had to attend a black tie event in Las Vegas for my husband's business, had nothing to wear and no time to shop. I ordered six dresses from Amazon (all with free return policy) and had them shipped directly to the hotel. I ordered this dress as my one ""risky"" choice.
After trying them all on for my husband and his manager this dress was the clear winner. I'm still getting compliments on it months later from other associates. Now I know where I'm shopping for next year.",5
684961,"Definitely need to go a size up. I have a long torso so it makes it a bit tight in the hip and crotch area. Overall I really like it, but definitely need to go up a size or too. I got a large. I'm 5/7 size 36 DD Hips are about 42""",3
834383,"I'm 120-125 (depends how many burritos I've eaten) 32inch chest, 26-27 inch waist and this fits perfectly and snug. It has a lot of stretch so I think it could fit a small to medium no problem as long as it's long enough. If you have a long torso, I'm not sure you'll love it as much. It's great for layering under sweaters, jackets, etc. It has a moderately high scoop neck which I think is extremely flattering.",5
444266,"I am always focusing on details. You only get one shot! My new fiance was sooo excited to see the ring in this lighted box that with all the excitement and the light it displayed, she took the ring out and placed it on herself. I was in shock! Stole my thunder but this box purchase was well worth it! I recommend it!",5
574589,I haven't a clue how a man of average endowment is supposed to fit into these ridiculously small pouches and heaven help someone like me who is larger than average.  I couldn't get one ball into the pouch much less my entire package.  Don't waste your money on these way-too-small pieces of junk.,1
560163,"Very cheap looking and cheap material. I attempted to wash just to see if it would look better. Unfortunately since I now can't return, I will send to a woman's shelter in hopes in an emergency someone will get at least one wearing. I likely will never purchase clothing from Amazon.com again.",1
55518,"Thanks for the perfect fit & I was comfortable all night long, the shoes are great.  I plan to get a lot of use out of them, you know there's church on Sunday & the ladies tea, plus other functions that they will be a good fit for.  A lot of fun is to be had with these great shoes.
Good fit, comfortable & great price.  THANKS for a really good product!",5
239757,"Purchased this ring for my hubby. Great quality, exactly as described (size, color, etc.). Nice feel on the finger, he loves it.  Shipping was prompt.  With Amazon 2day, i ordered on Thursday afternoon, received it on Sat.  Very satisfied and would buy from MJ Metals Jewelry again.",5
393834,"I bought these and a similar pair that have glass lenses but not polorazed. Very lightweight the 58mm fit well. These are not super dark which is exactly what I wanted. I prefer the glass lenses even though they are heavier but those were not polarize. Come in a soft snap closed top pouch.
They both are very good for the price depending on what is important to ;you.",5
381470,"I just received it and time will tell, but so far it appears to be sturdy and functional, with plenty of pockets for organizing items, and a padded laptop section in the center. I especially appreciate that it is lightweight and has a comfortable shoulder strap that is long enough to be carried cross-body.",4
757300,"It is a little bit large, BUT there is an adjustable stretch band that solved the fit problem immediately.  I thought from the description that the hat would look like the baseball hat, but it really is just a bowl hat with a very small visor. For the price, it is a great purchase.",4
180682,"Pros: This jacket is so adorable.  The materials are nice--it doesn't look or feel cheap.

Cons: Based on what other reviews said, I ordered two sizes up.  However, the size that I ordered was much too baggy.  If you normally wear a medium like me, I would suggest ordering the large (NOT the extra large!).

Sad to send it back because it is so cute, but it just didn't have the fitted look I was hoping for.",3
695892,"This bag meets TSA regulations of what size of bag you can bring on the plane. It's super cute and made of a strong vinyl material. They have those little round legs on the bottom, that way it won't get scuffed up if you put it on the ground. It comes with a shoulder strap for easy carry. Lots of space. I bought the matching tote bag too to go with this. Great price for a bag too. Highly Recommend it!",5
195526,"I love these! I have now purchased 3 of them! I have Orange, Floral, and Stripe because they are so beautiful! I'm a big gal. 270lbs thanks to some medications I'm on. It makes me depressed when buying clothes and nervous about how they will look. These tops give me confidence and I love getting dressed up now! They are also very cool for the summer. Just match them to some nice tank tops underneath!",5
157884,The stripes on the pants are orange. Orange. They should be red as shown in the picture and to match the shirt. The leg cuffs are red. They were made using the same material as used in the shirt sleeve cuffs. I'm very disappointed. The quality of the shirt is on point.,2
276514,"Only had them for about a week so far, but all three pairs are even better quality than I expected for the price. The polarization naturally isn't going to be as good as glasses that cost $200, but they are at least polarized which is great! They look good and are sturdy. If anything changes, I'll update this review, but so far I'm very pleased!",5
412220,I was surprised at the amount this carry-on holds!  I used it for a 6-day trip and was shocked at how much it held while still being able to use it as a carry-on.  You can't go wrong with American Tourister.  It's the only brand I buy.  The quality of their workmanship speaks for itself.  Plus you can't beat the price!,5
212449,"They are a great, elegant, smooth gloves, just what i wanted, and i could text and use touch-screen devices without taking them off, they fit great. But the only thing was that they aren't very cold resistant, i was hoping they would be, but I'm not complaining! I love them",4
164647,I bought three other leggings along with this one (Red Quince) and I received it with without a tag and looks as if it has already been worn (lint pieces all over fabric) or previously returned. It also kind of smells like detergent or as if had been washed. Really bummed out because this is the one I was really excited for. Will be returning.,1
500168,"This skirt feels like your wearing nothing it is so comfy-but I can't go outside w/it on for fear of blinding my neighbors. I even wondered if I could place different fabric over it to cover the horrid ""mandarin/navy""stripe pattern. It was then that I realized I should return it ;
even@the sale price of $19 that is too much to spend for just around the house.",3
706176,"These are my favorite gloves!!  They are thick & warm enough for some pretty frigid temps.  I take long walks outside, even in the winter, and these gloves have kept my hands very warm.  Them being able to use touch screens is an added bonus.  They're also super cute.  If I ever lose my first pair, will definitely be buying another one!",5
402682,"The teen size worked really well for a small adult!  It's sets you apart from everybody else.

Love that it includes boot covers so you can wear comfy shoes.  The hat/horns are somewhat odd fitting.  It comes in 2 pieces...the pink fluffy part & the grey horn part.

Overall, very nice!",4
432000,"I got hold of this item;it was beautiful and was delivered on time. The problem is, I bought the item for $4.23 yet I could not understand why I am being charged $4.95 for the shipping when it weighs only 3 oz. Before I oredered it, I checked on the rates and it is a grat disappointment that I bought it at a lower price but had to pay more for the shipping of a 3 oz. keychain.",5
235568,Although cards do not fit all the way into the pockets this allows easier access and I have had not problem of cards falling out.  And yes it would be a good idea to put a rubber band on to make it more compact.  This holder is great for all those cards you need to tote around for doctor offices. Product is great for what I need it for.,5
675720,I couldn't believe these earrings when I saw them.  The are absolutely breath taking!.  They are a nice substantial size and the opals are beautiful and very colorful.  I bought them as a Christmas gift for my mother.  They didn't make it by Christmas but they were well worth the weight.  My mother absolutely loves them and wore them the same day we received them.,5
611738,"Came in earlier than expected. Is smaller than I hoped for it to be. It is not at big as it looks on the model. The holes are bigger on it (completely see through) and definitely need to wear something. Is very cute, just not what I expected. Might give it to my 12 year old cousin",1
467802,I ordered this and when I recieved my shipping confirmation it said I wouldn't get it for a month which made me very upset because I need it to finish my Halloween Costume but to my surprise I got it in the mail like 10 days later (maybe less than that) either way made it here before our party AND to top it of it's a better quality than I thought!,5
420476,"I got these chocolate/floral boots for the winter and after reading the reviews, I sized up from an 8 to a 9, and good thing too! The 9 fits perfectly and I even get to wear thick socks! I will definitely buy from this brand again, very good product all around.",5
642758,"I have purchased these before and I'm not sure this was the same vendor.  I am so disappointed with these.  I have ruined so many sheets and clothing because although I have washed each of them over 100 times, literally, they still have the dye.  My sheets are now black, my sleeping clothes, the toilet seats. Also the size wasn't true to form this time and gave me a muffin top.  Really disappointed this time.",1
528748,Definitely a lighter pink than the color shows in picture. Order a size bigger than you normally would if you have a curvier bust and bottom order your normal size if you have a smaller chest and behind. I am a M and I ordered a large fits just fine. Color is off that is all. Still like it and material is decent quality for the price. You would never know it was cheap.,4
112849,"My father bought these for my kids.  They arrived in a timely manner, but one pair broke within days of having them.  My kids are older and very careful with their possessions.  Actually, these broke with my kids actually using them for a total of 5 minutes.  Heed the warnings from this and other reviews.",1
397830,"Nice beret. If i dislike anything about it, its the headband. Its uncomfortable. I recently ordered an authentic beret from the Basque Country, and the quality is leaps and bounds above the kangol. The basque beret has no headband so its much more comfortable to wear. All in all, its a nice little beret if you're going for a look but not for daily use",4
861746,"The product runs small.  They didn't want to hassle with a return so I was given a 5 dollar refund (was supposed to be 50%) but I paid more than 10 initially.  So,  I don't know what happened.  They were too tight and pinch your jewels,  according to the bf",3
388087,im pregnant and my boobs are growing by the day. i wanted a comfy sports bra that was spandex so i could also substitute it as a swim top. i read 8 pages to figure out what size to order and finally decided on an XL. im currently a 36 DDD and this fits perfectly! very pleased for the price!,5
1281,"I got this chain in the 30"" length along with several pendants from Gem Ave.  I love this chain, it looks nice and is really tough.  I am kind of hard on chains and was worried about buying one online without seeing it.  I could not be happier and the price is great.",5
803714,"This is a great white shirt but it is see through and the metal on the sleeves are silver so if you like gold and are really into coordination, this will limit the wearability of the shirt. It is a lot more boxy than it looks on the model but the material isn't stiff or uncomfortable",5
239071,These fit like a dream and I really love these jeans. These are very high quality for the price and comfortable. I wore these all day to an amusement park and they didn't stretch out at all. The only little critique I would give is that these are not true skinny jeans the are actually straight leg because they fit in the thigh and are loose on my calves.,5
307241,"This is a really nice short. The fit is a little narrow in the legs, and I wish they were an inch longer. However, the fabric is great with a little bit of texture, and they are quite comfortable. The look is a little dressier than most of my other walk shorts, but it is nice to have options.",4
880900,"I love it, it's beautiful, but I will have to lose some weight to wear it.  Hard to get on because of the tight waist and having to get it over my hips....shoulders are loose, but hoping to get it altered a little or wear off shoulder.  You need help getting into this because the back laces up, no zipper",4
448507,"Purchased this for the groom to wear at his bachelor's party, and it was the star of the show. From a distance, it looks very real, and closer up, it's quite a shock that a guy is wearing it. I would HIGHLY recommend this shirt for such events. A real conversation starter!",5
221211,"Great colors and styles. People on my Ultimate team loved them as we dressed up as ""Wet Hot American Summer"" and I gave everyone a friendship bracelet because we where at camp. But if you are going to be playing with these and playing ultimate make sure to tie them very tight with some great knot because they will slip off.",4
416076,"TOTALLY too small! Im a 34D and it just covers my nipples. LOL! Sorry this is super cute to tan in but definitely not to wear anywhere in front of family/guys. hahah! Ok, Im a confident gal and don't really worry too much about that BUT this is a little risque for most. Also, the material is pretty cheap. I guess you get what you pay for. I'll make it work.",2
105435,We have purchased multiple Leveret footed pajamas. They are great COTTON pajamas. Cotton pajamas allows for a little  stretch so you can actually get your little one in the pajama without feeling like you are going to break them! They do fit about a size smaller than labeled. So in my opinion you should buy a size up.,5
458799,"My son is an anime fan and has gotten several costume jewelry pieces (necklaces, rings, etc) and most are cheaply made and fall apart within a short time.  This ring is more substantial than most and the glass/plastic gem is solid and attached well.  He likes it better than others he's gotten over the years and fits well.  If  you have big fingers may be small - my son has thin fingers and fits well.",4
778441,"I like the feel and look of the pants, exactly as pictured. As for my taste the size chart if misleading, the 1X should be marked 2X. unless you like and want a baggy look. Not as fitted as picture., yet still like and wear them mostly as casual house wear.",4
444264,"We are planning a surprise party for one of my older sisters who just loves the Fancy Nancy character in childrens story books.  Bought this for dressing her up to be Fancy Nancy.  From the description wasn't sure if it would fit an adult size head, but very pleased that it does!",5
656561,"I like it it's nice , the slit isn't that noticeable unless your leg is sticking out & the material see through , you see the second layer from the front too , I got a medium because it said it came smaller but I should have stocked to my original size which is small",4
9734,My son was so excited to receive these shoes for Christmas. After a couple of weeks of wear the soles have completely seperated from the canvas. He has worn vans for years and these did not hold up in quality compared to his previous pairs. We were very disappointed. I hope it was just a fluke in production.,1
86304,"Yes it is a very cute dress in the picture I like the style and print but I do not feel confortable wearing it! It is way too short and flowy and I'm a very petite girl (5'1 ft. and 105lbs) so most clothes run big on me but this one its just too small. Also, was it supposed to come with a belt? Because I did not receive it.",2
809642,"This fits really well! I love the bottoms! I got two sizes and the fit is pretty true to size. The bottoms are very form fitting and really hold my mommy stomach in. I've received lots of compliments on this bikini! Love!

I received a discount in exchange for giving my opinion and review of this product.",5
567683,"I tried them on and the shirt was fine, but the crotch of the pants were very holey around the crotch seams and already had a run in them starting from the crotch up to the middle of the waistband and center of the butt.  Very cheap material for it to have a run like that already.  Nevertheless, I will only be wearing the shirt.  Photo attached.",3
708909,"When I think of the term ""one size"", the first thing that usually comes to mind is an oversized item, big, roomy, comfy. This was not the case this time, one size, may fit my young niece but not an average sized woman, I was very disappointed. All in all, it was a beautiful sweater, well made, was looking forward to wearing it, now I'm looking forward to giving it away since I do not like the hassles of trying to return things.",1
334465,"OK.....I received this tiny wallet and actually laughed at it. I was just about to return it when I started adding the mountainous amount of cards I carry around every day in a less than adequate antique wallet. I put 12 credit and insurance cards, driver's license, 2 business cards and 5 different denomination US currency bills and still had room! So I put 6 other business cards from lawyers, plumbers, doctors, etc. and still had room. I keep opening it up to make sure this is not a trick. All cards are easily accessible.....I'll be damned!",5

They won't stay up without them.
If you have garters then go ahead and buy them, if not... stay away.
To the seller... change the picture or add a description.",2
510573,"The dress looked nothing like the picture. It was obvious that the dress was poorly made. The area where it seems like there's a black mesh all around had the mesh cut around the embedded flowers. I could have done a better job!
Not worth spending your money. Good thing Amazon offered free returns on this item, I surely used it.",1
770042,"Top was very small although I ordered a medium. The shorts fit great, but the top barely covered my breast! Afraid, shorts will be too big if I exchanged for a large. I am usually a size 0-3  and so I followed the advice from Customer review, and ordered  a medium.",3
49907,"Everything is great about the portfolio, but I have one complaint that is probably particular to my situation.  I don't use it to carry a laptop; only books, a leather folder, and miscellaneous stuff when I travel on a plane.  While the description states it is ""top zip"", unfortunately, this folder has zippers along three sides, so there is a chance it could unzip and some of my smaller items (earphones, etc.) could unknowingly fall out.  It simply means I need to be a bit more careful.  Otherwise, it's great.",4
233324,"Love  it, this hat is warm.  I  bought it in Ivory for one of those complete fashion sets, Ivory & red set, this set it off a little  better.  The hat  has an ""BRAND TAG, IN TAN LEATHER / C.C  IN bedded  on the hat.  I loved seeing this, shows name brand  quality rather it's or not.  Looks like C.C. for Chanel, or what other name brand with cc.  Coach.  It's worth the buy.  Should have bought 1 for each color coat, I have.",5
612026,"Every size is the same.  I ordered a small and returned it because it was too small, than I ordered a medium and it was the same so I returned it and ordered a large and it was also the same size.  I'm still confused.  I'm 5'4 and 124 lbs",1
304607,I love a Big Buddha purse and have several.  This one is the right size for the person that has a bad back and is not allowed to carry a big purse.  It is also good for people that are trying to walk again and still be stylish.  You can carry what you need and no more.  Like I said the perfect size.  I got this one and gave one away for Christmas to a girl who has a bad back and neck...she LOVED IT! !just right for u er also and her husband agreed.,5
795994,"This is an absolutely beautiful dress. It runs a little small and is quite long, so take that into consideration when ordering.  Will need to alter. Still for the price and the beauty of the dress, worth the money to alter. Although in China the sellers were easy to work with and quite willing to work anything out. We had an issue that was worked out satisfactorily for both parties. The seller is very willing to settle any and all problems. Would defiantly order from them again.",4
728871,"I love the color of the seed beads on this bracelet; the photo doesn't do them justice. They're like Aurora borealis beads, shimmering with different colors, depending on how they are caught by light. It's comfortable. One size fits all, even if you have trouble with bracelets being small enough as I do. Many bracelets slide up my arms but this stayed firmly on my wrist. I love it! The carrying pouch Is also adorable! I gave used it to store not only this bracelet but two others and it still cinches well.",5
329889,"Absolutely in love with the looks of this bracelet, unfortunately the clasp on mine ended up breaking after a month.. not sure if this was a common problem for anyone else or not.  However, they did send me two bracelets in the same package (not sure if by mistake) so I had a replacement for the first.",3
406536,I used this iron logo to add to my black grad robe to make it into a Hogwarts robe for Hufflepuff. It was a cheap and easy way to make the robe until I could buy a better robe that looks closer to the actual robes at a later point in time.,5
643827,"I really love this dress! The fit was great! I wear a size 16. I am almost 5'8, 190 pounds smaller chested..I wear a B cup and am a bit hippy. :0) I have the black, blue and the blue paisley. I wear  them with a cute shrug and it looks adorable. This dress  can be worn shopping, work or church. Oh and the shipping...it came in 2 weeks early, all of them did. I ordered all at different times and they all came in before expected! love it.",5
363898,"I bought this for the top only. I knew the bottoms would be too revealing for me. For the price, I was fine with that. The top is awesome! Four stars, because straps on the top were very loose. All it took was two safety pins to fix to the appropriate length. I plan on sewing them soon. Overall, I love this top!",4
600354,"I love this dress. I got married and did not want to spend a ton on a wedding dress. I paid for expedited shipping and got it in 2 days. It was prettier in person. I do recommend getting it a few sizes bigger (3 to 4 sizes) Mine was 2 sizes up and still was snug, I ended up getting it slightly altered, but because of the price, it was still within my budget. I even added a sash to match my shoes. I got so many compliments on this $65 dress!",5
776315,"The material is terrible! Not elastic whatsoever! The fit is bad too. An XL fits me with any other spandex or leggings I own, so that what I ordered. However, they are definitely not made for someone with thick thighs and a butt. Im 5 7 a size 12  so the length is like capris on me. Also the waist band isn't the same size at the material its covered in, its a very awkward arrangement.",1
466041,"These are odd fitting shorts. They were too big in the waist and short in the crotch. I am 5' 1"" , 120lbs, and athletic so crotch waist length should not be a problem. They pulled up in the crotch and inside thighs while walking. You cannot adjust the waist in these shorts as the draw cord is decorative.",2
80139,"These pants are great and comfy!! While I'm a size 2/3 and workout 5 days a week, I still get cellulite in my butt and legs. I have had the hardest time finding pants that will hide it. I FINALLY found them!! I love the pockets on the back as well. :)",5
579769,The jacket is fantastic. The only thing is it's just a little tighter than expected around my hips because I have a smaller torso and wider hips and the cut of the jacket is straighter rather than the slight curve they show in the image but honestly its not an issue at all and I'm absolutely in love with the color as well as how it performs.,5
829516,"The dress was pretty and traditional, the look we were going for but when we got it in the mail the outer part looked way to big for the undergarment. When I tried it on my baby it was huge. Quality is good tho. Had to return due to size.",3
577388,"I love this sweater! I am actually wearing it right now. I love the way it fits. It is slightly baggy, but I like that boyfriend style. I receive several compliments every time I wear it. It is super soft and cozy. I machine wash it and tumble dry it. I have not noticed any difference with the shape. I highly recommend.",5
337257,"At first glance these aviators look great in every way- size, frame, and color. As far as functionality, they might as well be an eyepatch. You literally cannot see through them! In addition, I'm appalled that the seller actually texted my mobile number, let alone had the audacity to ask for 5 stars and offer a $1 Amazon card in exchange. I shop on Amazon daily and I don't recall granting permission to allow a third party seller to use my personal phone number. Not appreciated",1
265768,"These are pretty good. Was hoping they would be a bit more narrow, since I have a narrow face. I'm able to use 2 of the 4, out of the pack. Though really thought they would be more narrow. But for the price, it's ok that just 2 work for me.",4
370441,"Love love love these leggings! Bought a pair since they were a lightning deal and loved them so much I just bought another! I'm 110lb and 5'1"" tall. The XS/S fit perfectly. Since I'm short the ankle length actually fit me like full length legging which is what I was hoping it would do!",5
829786,"I purchased the orange cover up and the color is nice and vibrant and the material is good. The only thing that I don't like is the weird, black lace bordering at the end of the garment - which is not depicted in the photo! This gives it more of a nightgown/sleepwear feel than what I was going for, which is a sexy, pool ready cover-up. However, it can be fixed by simply cutting out the lace via alterations. But do I want to spend $11 to do so when the garment only cost $6!! SIGH!!",3
85809,"This stretch belt is very pleasing to the eye.  It looks good on black or khaki pants.  With this belt, I followed reviewers suggestions to order one size UP from what you would normally wear.  That worked for me.  I am very happy with my purchase.",5
406034,"These are just what I was looking for.  I purchased several pairs to give to my bridesmaids and I am very impressed.  The earrings look beautiful and they arrived in cute little boxes each with a small satin ribbon.  I was going to put each pair in a jewelry box but the boxes they came in are really cute.  No comment on comfort, wear, etc. because the girls have not worn them yet and I doubt they will tell me if they are not comfortable!",5

I have several different pairs that come out of the wash just as nice as they went in and show no ill effects from drying on medium heat.  Love the fact that the socks are mirror-images of one-another so you can have the same design showing on both sides.",5
458967,"I had a wallet of the same brand for the last 2 years and it did start falling apart in the end but using it daily for 2 years, I feel like it's a good product.  The only drawback is that because it's not leather, the card compartments are a bit stiff and difficult to get the cards/license out etc, they would be softer and more supple if leather.  But for the price and fun designs, it's still a great wallet.",4
862048,"VERY QUICK SHIPPING and FREE!  Ordered on Wednesday and Delivered Friday! What a QUICK seller! I decided to go with black on this one. It's MATTE black, and the lens had a blue tint to it (also UV 400 protection). Nice modern style to these shades, similar to Oakley Frogskins or Ray Ban Wayferers. A must buy for this summer, or any weather for that matter!!!",5
416183,"I am new to Switchflops and I have a size 6 kitten heels. I bought the small size because that is what Switchflops says for a size 6.  Next time I am ordering the medium because even though they fit, they don't go all the way to the sole. The quality was exactly what I expected and was new in package.",5
245587,"It didn't look cheap and flimsy like I kinda thought it would, and I gave it my aunt for Christmas, who loved it. I got the blue one and it was really pretty.

Took like 2 months to get to me though, and arrived at the end of January despite me ordering it in November, so that kinda sucked.",4
311386,"The belts are very good quality but an 1 1/2 inches wide and very heavy canvas and the rings are to large and heavy for a small woman or girl.
I was hoping for 1 inch and lighter canvas plus smaller ring. I don't like the buckle/rings to show under my blouses/shirts on low rise jeans/slacks.
Great quality but just to big and bulky. To return them, I must send them to China so I can't afford the postage.",1
140448,"I know they are fake, but im still disappointed to not have diamonds on the cats eyes as shown in the photo. The diamond on the fish eye is really large, falling off, and not at all realistic looking. The fish looked old and kind of dingy instead of new.",3
821138,I just bought this bag for my daughter to go camping with.  We received it quickly and in good order.  I got it on a discount and would happily paid full price.  It seems of very good quality and has just enough pockets for all her gear.  The shoulder straps seem very good and padded also.  This blue and the blue we got also matches the color well.,4
306500,My daughter *just* started wearing 3T but I ordered a 4T so these would fit for a while. However the shirt is SO small. The arms are extremely narrow and will even be tight on my 12month old. It is not a long shirt either. A 4T should have come past her waist but it barely will cover her tummy. But that pants are the opposite: Big! I'll have to roll up the legs. Very disappointed in the poorly sized pajamas.,1
398759,"Great looking buckle but it was a little smaller than I thought it would be. The seller does have the measurements listed in the description but of course I didn't read that so not much room to complain. I like the finish and it looks good with the distressed, black belt I bought to go with it. Overall good buckle. Would recommend to others if you're in to Celtic stuff.",4
274149,I chose to go with this belt based off the reviews but I didn't understand how a belt would work with a ratcheting system. The answer is it works great! No holes to worry about. Always a nice fit. Easy to adjust if you have a little too much dessert. I'm very happy with the purchase.,5
465267,These fit kind of strange on me.  They are tight on my hips and long in the length of the pant legs. I have long legs so this is usually not an issue that I have.  I like the style of pant and they would be good with heels. But I don't want to always wear heels to work so it's a toss up.,3
617985,"Good product for the money. It fits snug, but then again, I'm fat. And if you have to use the bathroom before riding ... well, you might as well strip, because that's what you will have to do. Try that in a port-pottie without letting anything but your shoes touch the floor.

OK...follow up on this one. After the fourth wash, the stitches started coming out of the shorts and not at stress points. I doubt this suit will stay together for an entire summer. I have lowered the rating from four stars to two.",2
76185,"While this isn't a substitute for well-fitting maternity pants, it's really great to have on hand to convert your regular pants or even to help reinforce your maternity pants early on if they're too loose.  My only caution: if you're nauseated during your first trimester like I was, wearing one of these may be uncomfortable, but hang onto it for later when the queasies will hopefully go away!",4
688399,"It came super quick, even before they said the first day on the range of delivery!! It looks exactly like the pictures, beautiful and shiny. Great quality and feels like real silver.

234539,"The reviews on this product don't really help and but I am giving you the honest truth hear. You get what your pay for! The metal bar one, has some type of coating and it peels off after few wears also instead of 3 different necklaces, its one big thing AND IT TANGLES. THE TANGLING IS UNBEARABLE. You can't even wear it for 20 minutes with out it tangling. If your crafty you can fix it up with out a problem so its not too bad but if you want a quality everyday necklace this isn't it.",3

Well Im coming up on fifty so at least Ill qualify for AARP . Plus shes my ex-wife now anyways. I love this product so much Im buyin 2 more. One for the mud room and one for the closet, and one for my dad!  Seriously though it also prolongs the life of your shoes by not crushing the back of the shoe with you're heel.",5

624727,"I had been looking at these online for 2 years and so happy I finally purchased them. However, as with all of the women's Dunks, they do fit a bit small. I am usually a comfortable size 6 but I have these and two other pairs of dunks in a 6.5 and they fit perfectly and I couldn't go any smaller",5
419294,"On cold days, it gives me a warm, comfortable feeling when I wear it!!  Fits exactly the way I like a 2XL to feel, loose and not binding at the shoulders, waist, hips.
 I also like the color and after washing and drying  it,  I can still wear it as I had the first time!!  Thank you!!",5
243418,"The picture doesn't do these earrings justice.  The sparkle is excellent.  My sister thought I had a new pair of diamond earrings.  I also love that they've stainless steel.  I cannot wear a lot of costume jewelry because of the nickel that's in in, so I end up spending a lot more money to get silver, gold or platinum.  These I could wear with ease--no trouble with skin irritation at all.  I would encourage anyone considering these to go ahead and purchase them.  You won't be sorry!",5
433617,"I'm glad  that the product appeared to be looking exactly like on the picture. I am mainly pleased with this product. It's good for office and also going out after work.
Since it's not from leather, then you can smell a bit the material, but this i felt only when taking it out from the package. After using it couple of times i couldn't smell it anymore.

I got it in black and black is looking very stylish for this bag.

Overall I am very happy with it so far!",4

Update: I had forgot to update this review. Two weeks after getting the necklaces the chain broke in the most inconvent place. No I'm having a difficult time finding a decent chain that will go through the charm, match it, and not turn my skin green.",1
231335,"I have several models of Saxx and wondered how the fit was across the models and ultimately I wondered what 'Modern fit' means, well after receiving these and comparing them to the Ultra model, modern fit means Millenials must have extremely tiny wiener and no cajonnes! Because the ball park pouch is a third of the size on these compared to the ultras.  If you are a modern person with apparently a tiny package these will fit great!  If you are average or above the Ultra or platinum models fit your packed lunch a lot better.",2

Perfect for my shape!",5
746501,I love this bag - I want others to match when I can. This purse is great - has pockets just right size - holds my tablet when I want - light weight - and I love the colors and quilting on the purse too. Straps are just the right length for me also. Can you tell that I like it.... I am so happy about this purse.,5

I bought the royal blue color and it looks great. The mesh is actually white not nude. I'm not crazy about the gold bead that sits on top of the bikini triangle so i just slid it to the end of the strap. Not bad at all for a $13 bikini set!",4
745697,"Beautiful, and so soft with lots of room pockets and credit card slots. The wristlet is such a safer way to carry a wallet.

Naturally, I am a size bigger than i was before I had my child, so I ordered an XL, reading the measurements.  The fabric is SUPER SOFT, for starters and made quite nicely.

834228,I expected this bag to be a lightweight nylon so was surprised to discover it's a heavier canvas like fabric.  I like all of the compartments and the blue color is very attractive.  I have found the zippers to be a bit stubborn at times which is why I'm not giving it five stars.  It holds a lot of stuff and would even be a good small carry on bag.,4
521222,"These were a bit snug on my feet, but that's mostly because I didn't think of the fact my feet are kinda bigger than average. Like someone else has said, it did have an unpleasant smell but I'm used to it and luckily the con I'll be wearing these to is still over 100 days away so that'll give me time to let the smell die down. Otherwise, I already love them and think they were decently made!",4
322239,Bought this for my friend and she loved it. It was shipped from Korea so I expected it to come later on but It came way earlier than expected. The socks felt like it was made from good material and not to mention they were beyond cute. I would totally buy these again.,5

I purchased this for her in hopes it would give her some comfort that her dad is always with her.  She received it and was in tears (with joy).

Bought it in navy and very pleased with the color (love their charcoal as well).",5

The inner zip up layer is shorter and ends around the belly button.  There are also no inner pockets.,3
374625,"I am loving this belt! It is super adorable and really good quality. It came in a velvet pouch with instructions on how to tie it 3 different ways.  It is a bit snug in me, but that is my fault for not measuring correctly. I'm 5'9"" and 250 lbs for reference. If you are smaller than that, I would definitely recommend this belt!",5
345551,"I love the price for these. They are both very pretty and look good without a hair band on them. As some other reviewers said, the edges of the cuff are a bit too low so the hair tie can slip off the bracelet occasionally. I don't really mind having to put it back on every once in a while, especially for the price.",4
721844,"A previous review states that this top is sheer, I agree, the left side of the top is an open weave and requires a cami or tank underneath-I did not expect to have to layer other clothing with this top. While it is nice, it's definitely NOT worth the $64 charged for this top.  It's worth about $30 at most.",3
772201,"Glad I ordered this at less than $50 b/c I thought about returning it at even that price.  Poor quality, spent first 10 minutes cutting off threads.  But, loved the pattern, even though it's a big gaudier than pictured,  so I kept it.  It doesn't feel like the material will be cool in hot weather, but I live in N. IL so it'll be a few months before I can find out if my impression is right or wrong.",4
311774,"I initially thought about trying to sew my own vest. I don't sew: it would have been a learning project. As it turns out, I'm really glad I didn't. This vest was perfect! And the pockets are functional so it would work quite well for actual use (vs costume), as well!",5
553468,"I can button it but am uncomfortable when sitting if it's buttoned.  Whether I'm wearing it open or closed, it is small across the shoulders.  I bought the right size for my frame so I would say it simply fits slightly on the small side.  It seems to stretch over time however, or else I have just gotten used to it.",4
579516,"I really liked the design and feel of these. They are soft and warm. However, within one week of wearing, the strap came off one glove. It is beyond my sewing ability to fix. These are cheaply made, and they were a waste of money for me.  I should have known, as I believe they came from China.",2
390764,I have a problem  with pierced earrings so I thought I would try these.  They are very pretty.  At first they were a little hard to get adjusted to fit my ears but once I got it right it was great and still is great.  I love them.  I would highly recommend them.  I did receive a small discount to try them out and give an honest opinion.,5
66073,"I love these! So much cheaper than buying them at the mall. When I first got my tongue pierced, I bought 2 for $10 at the piercing place and the acrylic balls broke on both of them. I didn't have that problem with these. They also work as nipple rings. I kind of wish there were solid colors but there doesn't seem to be any in the picture, so thats my bad. Definitely worth the price.",5
164622,"I have tried expensive workout leggings and these by far are so much better !! You get quality for a fraction of the cost AND they never roll or pinch or move like my $79 Nike leggings did !
I workout 6 days a week doing high interval training and strength training and these are my preferred brand to do it in !",5
452588,"I bought this version opposed to the women's version due to sizing. I didn't want a shirt that ran small. This shirt is not only large on me (normally a 3x in women's), it is long enough as well, but it is also very comfortable and the detail of the design is great! Fast shipping too! Thanks!",5
722702,"It's beautiful!!!! So comfortable and the color is what you see in the picture!!!! I purchased the Wine colored coat and in so in love!!!! Wearing it for the first time today as it came in the mail yesterday evening, also it came in the mail ALLOT quicker than expected.",5
106655,"This shirt's material is a little too ""swimsuit-like."" It's a polyester that reminds me of  rough dolphin skin.

The cut is too cute for me to return it, but I honestly think that if anyone were to hug me in it, we might catch fire. It's a really rough polyester.",3
676162,"It's so hard to find baby gear that isn't kitschy or blah, so finding this company was wonderful! The print is very bright and true to photo colors. Slim fit which is great for us because my son is very slender and he looks like he's wearing a sack with most of the sleepers that are long enough. Extremely happy with this buy and will definitely be ordering more clothes from Leveret :)",5
109738,This shirt is nice but definitely very tiny. I usually wear a L-XL depending but ordered a 2XL. All of the other 2XL shirts I ordered from other companies are perfect or slightly larger than expected. I could barely put this sucker on. If you a S I would order a L just to be safe. If you wear a Xl then don't buy.,1
429825,"Well, the dress itself was VERY CUTE and the material was really nice, but it was a lot shorter than I thought...and also made me look kinda big. I would recommend if you're a tiny person, for sure! But I'm shaped like a tiny pear, so didn't really work out...",3
655787,So cute. Bought as part of a Halloween costume and my daughter refuses to take them off. She wore them in semi wet weather and the bottoms are not peeling away (it's cardboard from the feel of it and the way it bends) but I don't recommend much outdoor play in them.,4
659896,"UPDATE -- After washing these ONE time, the small straps have come off. I could sew these back on, but it's frustrating. The stitching lacks quality. I really love the design, but I would purchase this style from another manufacturer.
-------------
This product is just as I expected. I purchased these to wear under low-cut tops for an extra interesting layer. It's very lightweight and thin, so I wouldn't wear it alone. It's not very supportive but it would be perfect to wear to yoga class. I really love it. I would purchase these in other colors as well!",2
656746,"This is a cute necklace, and about what I expected for the price. The pink on the outside of the necklace is super bright and darker than in the picture, the resin the pink is made out of is raised, and the back of the pendant is plain concave gold, but it suits my purpose perfectly, and I'm happy with it! It'll work wonderfully if I ever want to do a Kingsman costume, and it looks super cute just for daily wear.",5
303383,"I have had this ring for about a month now. I wear it 4-5 days a week, and it hasn't change my finger any colors, the ring hasn't changed colors, it still looks great. I've received several compliments on it, and nobody has noticed it is fake. If I look up close, I can obviously see that it isn't real, but nobody else can. I recommend!",5
733040,"Snowsuit is a good value for the price.  However, it is hard to get my child's legs in easily when dressing her, and the zipper area tends to irritate her neck (she's a little short, so we can't zip it all the way up just yet).  To mitigate this, we have her wear a turtleneck, but it's not a perfect fix.  Otherwise, it's a warm suite, decent fit, and waterproof. Temperatures have been in the teen's and this has managed to keep her warm.",3
88398,"This costume is perfect ,the skirt its not too short its appropriate for trick and treating with the kids and at the same time is also cute. It does not need to purchase a underskirt or Pettit skirt. The only little disappointment is the size of the gloves-they are small if the costume is plus size I will expect the gloves to be bigger than size S or M",5
56549,"These are ok. I bought them to combat thigh rub when wearing dresses and they work for that. For me they were very small in the thigh area and too big in the belly, even in my last trimester.

There is a seam up both sides of the belly that shows under your dress, even if it isn't tight. The material is a thick nylon so can be hot if you are wearing in hot weather. The material of mine got runs and holes after wearing several times.",3
71864,"This was perfect for my son's christening. At just 3 months old though, we ordered the 3-6 month size. He is a big baby though, about 14 lbs at the time! The pants were kinda weird like Steve Urkel all the way to his pecs - but a size smaller would have made the shirt & vest way too tight. The hat was so cute too and the little bowtie just made it. I would recommend for anyone looking for a boy's baptism outfit.",4
242734,"I liked this ring, but I ordered a size 4 and it was a little on the small size. I probably should have gotten the 4.5 size. I still can fit in the size 4, but it's a bit snug. Very comfortable. Hardly notice it's on my finger. Nice mm for my small hands.",4
184036,"Absolutely love the top. I ordered another in a smaller size because I think im bigger than I am. I first ordered the xl . Im 5'2"" 140 presently and the top hits my knee. I shrunk it and it fits pretty good (big) although it didn't shrink to much I have to pull it up to my hips to get the look in the picture. I think the large will fit better. The fabric is nice
 I love it.",5
641794,"The shirt fit as expected and colors are beautiful, but the shorts are entirely too small and do not flare like bermuda shorts as the picture looks like.  They fit like dance tights and the material chafed my girls legs.  She is petite, still fits in 2T and she is 31/2.  I ordered the 3T.",3
33572,"Love these! They are nice and snug. My thighs are probably about the same size as the model in the picture, maybe a bit thicker, but not by much. They fit perfectly. I am 5'4"" and these come up pretty high, but they are flexible enough to fit lower or higher on the leg. Love them!",5
444223,"You will not be able to use the hood at all, and the body area will fit a little larger than expected.  Trust me, this jacket is warm, but if it will rain, do not use this because it is not water proof nor does the hood function well.  It is a tiny little hood that only fits the very back of your head.",4
868509,"This bathing suit us SO cute. I feel in love with it from the moment I saw it. I did get the product for a discount in exchange for my honest review, but I would pay full price for it and then some. The top does run a bit small(or I'm a bit more chesty than most), do beware of that if you're big busted though. With the money! Got here super fast! So happy with it!",5
459092,"They were definitely fun colored. The fabric was cheap nylon, scratchy (not that I really expected any different that at <$5) and for me (5'9"" size 14) the large fit but was too tight and the fabric stretched so much the design was faded. Gave to a friend also tall but like a size 4-6, haven't gotten report back from her but I expect if she can get over the cheap fabric they will fit well.",2
564951,"It's so soft and really hot , which is what I wanted because I stay cold. It's super soft inside and out and the drop crotch isn't too low at all. Nothing has fallen off and I can't spot any loose threads or seams. The feet in the picture don't come with it! I suggest ordering a size up from your normal size or maybe two if your over 5""0 because I'm 4""8 ( I'm short ) and the small fit me perfectly.",5
649575,"The glasses look nice and very well using on sunny days. However, I personally think that I would expect the bridge between both lens is narrower.
And the cutting of plastic nose pad is poor. There was a sharp piece of excess plastic scratch my nose, so I have to cut and scrub that out.

However, with the price, I'm OK with the quality.",3
89928,These glasses were exactly what I expected and more! I bought them for my 6yr old daughter to wear to a 50's theme party. she loved them! And they fit her good. We have had them for over two weeks now and they are still fully intact ! They arrived to my house on time no issues what so ever.,5
411032,"I mean, is good but they are WAY too short... See I have long blonde hair and i was expecting it to look good and be atleast long enough for me to put it on the bottom of my head and they would look good.. no it looks so stupid. im so upset and i have to return them.",2
774291,I ordered a large based on the other reviews. I normally where a med in jackets but I didn't want it to be to snug so I got the lg. It fits really good and the sleeves comte down over the top of my hand which is exactly how I like for my jackets to fit.,5
94536,"This is a nice product, I like it in my speedy 30 and it does help. However, the interior pockets sometimes allows the items to go into the interior rather than the pocket itself. The only thing I don't like about Louie's...no pockets! Stupid design and this product does help.",5
231552,I'm on the hunt to find boxer briefs that will stay put. These are the closest I've come so far in my journey. The construction keeps me in the right place but I still haven't found any that don't rise up the thigh. But the light weight breathable and soft feeling material make any minimal bunching way less noticeable and uncomfortable than the every day underwear we can buy at the big box stores.,5
334194,I had purchased a different one with a different type of clasp for my boyfriend. He didn't use it but once bc the clasp was so difficult to release. It basically trapped you in. This was not the case with this belt. It was beautifully packaged and he loves it! Would highly recommend.,5
268279,"I love this purse, it is just the right size to hold a large cell phone and a few small items.  I had to contact the seller due to an error in my order, they responded quickly and resolved the issue very quickly.  I would definitely purchase from them again!",5
865907,"Very beautiful dress and well made!  Arrived earlier than expected.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is due to the beautiful fabric was thin and quite see thru.  I wished the fabric was thicker or has an under garment provided.  otherwise, it was very nice.",4
160032,"I LOVE this outfit! It fits slightly bigger than what I wanted it to but still VERY wearable!! I am going to order more from this company. Great price, decent shipping and great quality romper! I was expecting thinner, less quality and this is a good thickness without being heavy for summer! I have only tried it on a couple times I will update if I have problems after a wash or all day wear.",5
53087,"I had to get a sun hat for my 10 month old son, and we are leaving next week for Florida. I had ordered this because it was Amazon prime and would ship in two days. The picture shows this hat as a light tangerine orange. When I opened the box it was a bright, borderline neon orange. It's too late for me to return it and do an exchange. I realize it's all preference but bright orange doesn't look good on my kiddo while light orange does. Over all the fit was good and it looked cute.",3
422208,"I loved this. I purchased it for a baptism and it worked well. It's pretty thin which is good for warmer climates. The pants border being see through but I wouldn't have noticed if I wasn't looking for the diaper pattern. The outfit is very cute and was perfect for the occasion. I feel like it runs slightly large. My son is a solid 18-24m and I originally purchased the 24m size, which was much too big. I returned it for the 18m size and that seemed to fit perfectly so I would probably recommend sizing down if between sizes.",4
831190,"This is the first body chain that I've come across that is not a flimsy little chain! It is a nice thick, sturdy chain and I can't wait to show it off. Also, I was a bit concerned about if it would even fit someone with my body type (36-31-40, about a 8-10 in clothing) but it fit incredibly well!",5
286688,"I have a Casio Pro Trek PRW-7000-1AJF.  With my watch, this unit works exactly as described.  The watch was showing a ""medium"" battery level, and after a night in the charger, it showed ""high"" - so it did charge.  I've only used it once so far, but it does work with my Casio.",5
837410,"I LOVE this swim set so much I ordered a second one! Definitely order a size or two up. I am one of those people who spent my teen years tanning in a sunbed and now that I'm older and have a child I'm a lot more sun conscious. These suits are perfect for having stylish full coverage. It does form to your body when wet, so it isn't necessarily the most modest suit on the market, however for sun converage it's great. I love being able to swim without worrying about slathering myself head to toe in sunscreen!",4
384920,"First off, my order came very fast, so I was happy about that! I also received the cute and soft pink fluff ball keychain inside my backpack too, so another plus there too!

The size is exactly what I wanted! It can hold a good amount of items and has a durable feel to it. It's a perfect substitute if you're not a purse person or want something different that still acts as a purse. Highly recommend this product!",5
291570,"Just got my package in the mall I usually wear I medium but I read the reviews and it said the outfit ran a bit big so I got a small and it fits perfect I'm not wearing til my boyfriend's birthday on Friday so I'll post pics then, thanks guys!!!",5
378611,"I don't know why this is advertised as a swimdress because it is not. It is not made of swimsuit material, it's see though and at best could be used as a swim suit cover up but its so poorly made Inwouldnt even use it at that. It looks nothing like the picture and the straps were barely even sewn on. When I tried to put it on the strap broke off because of how poorly constructed it is. I also went by the size chart and it is huge.",1
613806,"The product fits as expected, but read the size guide. I had to go up 2 sizes from what I order in American brands like Jockey and Everlast. I've long been a fan of the string bikini-style underwear--and JinShi makes a great one. It's sleek, comfortable, breathable, and holds things in place. the only down side--you're not supposed to use a dryer. But if if you tumble without fabric softener and on a no-heat setting, they're fine.",5
398428,"I buyed a diamond, but the certified does not match whith my selection.  even when the certified of Amazon is correct, the certified of GIA doesn't match.  I leave this as well, because the issue that does not match (cut), don't have relevance in the price.  I buyed an ""Ideal Cut"" and I recieved a ""Very Good Cut"".

The ring, (18k gold), is excelent!",4
94309,"I received this product today and I LOVE it! The fabric is comfortable, and stretches nicely. It is long enough to not give me discomfort, and overall I would recommend this to anyone who is considering it. I didn't realize by looking at the picture, that the collar has a really soft lace material over the black fabric, making this product even MORE than what i expected :) I am truly satisfied!",5
240623,"Like this as a work ring. Worn it for a week non stop, no scratches, shine is still present. Like the comfort fit and weight if the ring. At first thought 4mm was too wide for me but have gotten use to it. A nice ring that I don't have to worry about.",4
815800,"Exceeded expectations! I ordered this in a small in white and both the style and fit is great. The best part about this off -shoulder top is that you can pair with a short or jeans on a cooler day, and both looks equally chic  It is not see through so it makes life easier! I washed it in the machine and it did not shrink and being lightweight, it dried fast as well. Great price point for this summer trend!",5
149982,"I realize that there are cheaper shoes bags available on Amazon, but you get what you pay for. These shoe bags fit every type of shoe and it stretches to accommodate bigger shoes. Also, it closes tightly. I love these shoe bags! I even ordered another set because when I travel I have multiple pairs of shoes with me and I like to keep my shoes separate from clothes and in great condition. I highly recommend these shoe bags for use when traveling or even just for your gym or sports shoes that you might have in your car.",5
399238,"Not sure if it is really Prada...it is way too small; even for a child that is 10.  I got it for pre-tween, and it's like a little pouch.  You can't even wear it on your back like a normal backpack...the straps/handles are not like a regular backpack.  If you are looking for something for school or even to walk around the mall with, this is NOT it.",1
356008,"The sewing at the seams is unraveling and there is extra hanging off. There is s small hole and a sizable stain. How did this get sent out?? Ill let him sleep in it as pajamas because its a pain in the bit to send things back, but this was horrible quality.",1
823060,"It's so cute. I wanted to love it. However, it's way too short through the waist. The length of the legs were good for a wide range of heights (if your height comes from your legs) but the waist length is just too short. I'm 5'4 and I couldn't even get it in my shoulders without it cutting me between the legs.
It just does not work and for that I am very sad  ;-)",2
277874,"I'm only 140lbs and bought a small, when I first tried it on I instantly went to the second row of hooks. It runs just a little bit big but it might be that I've lost inches around my waist as well, when I had placed the order I had not been working out yet. But I'm super happy with it and would definitely recommend it",5
411684,"The Scarf is a perfect size and a brilliant color. though the color is slightly off from the scarfs in the movies the scarf is an amazing buy. The price is very reasonable. The insignia is a little thick and patched on a little to far from its border but it's beautiful none-the-less. Not for kids BTW, its a full size scarf ^.^",5
283987,"The thread chosen for these is some cheap and fluffy nylon nonsense. If you breathe on this wrong it will completely unravel! It doesn't matter if you put this in a sturdy wash bag. You would have to wash them carefully by hand and pray for them. If Amazon wants to offer this two pack for $5 get them. If not they're not worth the hassle of mending, because they won't survive the season, LET ALONE ONE WASH ON DELICATE.",1

68101,Christmas gift for my son these were a big hit. He says they are comfortable and well cushioned. He wears a size 11.5 so I purchased a large and they were a perfect fit. Being a Seahawks family these were an ideal gift for the man who wears this style of slipper.,5
835934,Honestly when I bought this shirt I thought it was a simple dhl shirt I had no idea it was an actual brand for vetemens and once I bought the shirt I said oh well hopefully the coloring is right and it wasn't. The shade or yellow is very pale and then red is pale too. Next time I'll do more research.,3
239044,"These have seriously been my favorite pair of jeans this season. They are SO comfortable. Just the right amount of stretch and they don't get baggy with too much wear. I was also worried that washing them may make them way too distressed, but it hasn't. Would highly recommend these!",5

15168,"Yes these definitely helped and keep helping me, I was having a very bad time due to my plantar fasciitis and I tried Dr. S. Nothing, until these insoles got to my feet. Totally made a difference! From day one my feet felt better and now I'm getting better just by wearing them, just keep in mind, if you have real flat feet, you must get use to the arches but once your feet get into it you will be good to go.",5
161315,"I don't have super skinny legs, like the models they use for thigh highs, so when I do buy them, the socks don't fit like the way I want them to. These socks are amazing and fit just exactly how I want them to! So comfortable and I will defenetli be purchasing more!!",5
503276,"Pretty top, the straps are neat. Bought an extra large, but it was really a volcom-sized large. The volcom tag said large, the seller's tag that was stuck on top of the volcom tag was marked XL. Wish the seller's page would have advertised the right size, as the ""XL"" is not for anything over a B cup.",3

Ont he whole we like these products and would order again.",4
606734,"Decent price for resin beads. I like the color, I like the choice of charms... my only issue is the fit. 4 wraps is way too loose, 5 wraps is way too tight. It IS cute though, and goes with most of my summer clothes. I'm just going to have to restring it so that it fits me, and save the beads I'll have left over for something else.",3
632511,"Definitely expect the top to be super snug.. Some of the crossing literally squeezes you and is decently uncomfortable. I'm normally a medium bottom and top, however the bottoms maybe cover one side of my butt on a good day haha. Definitely go a size larger than you typically are because you can take it in WAY easier than letting it out due to the design on the back. Definitely cute though. Also gives you terrible tan lines heads up.",2
432475,"My daughter likes these because of the kitty faces.  She will keep them on better than other mittens because of this, so they are doing their job. They are easy enough for her 4 year old hands to get on and off. After an hour in wet snow, they were soaked on the outside. They didn't seem wet on the inside.  Good mittens for the price.",4
452559,I ordered these for my 3 year old who loves scooby doo! I ordered size 4 so she had room to grow in these. They fit loosely (as I was hoping) but perfect for size 4.

Most of them helped a little, but these insoles made all the difference. They are comfortable and fit my shoes well.  I transfer them from one pair to another, but I am going to purchase more so I don't have to do the transferring.  They have worn well, and I do a lot of walking.  I highly recommend them.",5
514951,"Awesome hat. Fabric and design are solid. One gripe, and it's my fault for not noticing before I rendered it unreturnable, is that the stitching of one of the 'breather holes' is ever so slightly tearing. My advice, just like when receiving anything else online, be sure to inspect all seems, stitches, and components of anything you get. I'm sure 99/100 of these hats are in perfect condition. Minor manufacturing flaw I could've easily had replaced had I noticed it before I sewed a ptch onto the front of it.",5
156755,"Very lightweight wallet.  Easily holds a good amount of cards.  You have to push the cards down into the slot, but at least you know they are snug.

Very strong case (just received it today), much better than the plastic quality I have used.

Would recommend this wallet.

If the slots for the cards could be a little bigger, that would be bonus.",5

823889,"This fits strange! The length is just at the length it's too short , the shoulders are too small, and the arm holes aren't right...but I gave it 3 stars because the material is nice, the price is cheap so I cut it open down  the front and made a tunic style top for my daughter.",3
444410,"I normally wear a size 11/13. I ordered the 13 just to be safe. The pants were way too small. They were more like a 7/9 than a 13. That being said, these do seem like good quality pants. I just suggest you order a bigger size than you would normally wear.",3
814178,"The ring is beautiful and I love the look of it. I gave it 3 stars because one of the small zirconias on the side fell out. I wore it only a.few times and did not hit it, or do anything that should cause it to fall out.
 I haven't yet called Amazon about it, but I intend to. I'm hoping they will replace it. A replacement will give it 5 stars.",3
539047,"I got 2x, usually 2x is a little big for me, which is how i like it, I don't want skin tight (tho it's not skin tight either) it's long enough to not show my @$$ when i stand up, but if i sat down it would. I really like the shirts, I just wish they were longer.",4
536804,"Even though the shorts look very nice. They feel a little tight at the bottom, but I could handle that. What I can't handle is that the fabric is see through. I know I could wear matching colour underwear but I would know that it's see through and it will bother me eternally.",3
61643,"Bought the S/M as well as the L/XL for c-section recovery. The larger size was great for earlier on and now that some time has passed and I am slimming down to my normal size, I am glad I have something a bit smaller. The silicon patch felt great on the incision, as the three different kinds of undies I had previously bought all rubbed against it in an unpleasant way. It is also nice to have the extra support for a post pregnancy body! Would recommend this product to anyone I know having a csection.",5
390456,"Great that they came in the three sizes. Perfect to fit most shoe heel widths. I bought these for my daughter's outdoor wedding and they fit nicely over the heel, are clear so they are not noticeable and provide an extended surface so you don't sink in. I think these are going to work perfect for the wedding party and we are going to buy more to leave in a basket at the entry incase our guests need some. I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion and I'm thankful someone thought to make these!",5
267108,"It is adorable, but it is teeny tiny.  I ordered a medium for my daughter but it was so small i had to give it to my friend who is 5 feet 1 inch and 100 pounds who wears a size zero. It just fit her.  Definitely measure and for reference I say it runs 2 sizes smaller than US sizes.",3
312893,"It fits great and helps when wanting to wear a dress without having to worry about chaffing or something of the sorts. It comes to just above the knee but if needed I am able to adjust accordingly. Very comfortable and soft, and they wash up nicely.
The only problem I have with it is the band around one leg didn't stretch as much as the other. And when I opened the package they had a smell, almost like a plastic chemical smell. Went away after the first wash.",4
488370,"This Bracelet is for my 15 year old daughter who is a HP nut. She absolutely loves this and it seems to be made fairly well. I don't think the clasp on would hold up to much abuse, but other than that, it's an inexpensive Deathly Hollows bracelet. For what it is, I think it's pretty decent. If your looking for an unbelievable piece of jewelry, than I would pass, but if you are looking a ""get what you pay for"", then this is the one.",4
256907,I get tons of compliments on this bikini.  The top took a little to figure out but I got it.  Do not get into the ocean or wave pool with this on.  The waves of the Atlantic ripped the top off of me like it was nothing ! lol,4
228081,I love it! The top is a little see through and the skirt has one piece of velcro to attach it together. But I actually kind of like that about it. Plus it was shipped discretely (it was packaged in a clear bag that was inside a larger white bag that was inside an even larger white bag that was shipped inside a clear very large bag.) if that's not discreet I don't know what is.  Overall I would give everything 5 stars. The outfit was wonderful and shipping was great ,5
282020,"I loved this backpack. It was comfy and had good amount of space for my laptop and papers. However, within two weeks, I noticed the stitching on one of the straps coming loose. I contacted customer services for help, but no one has responded in the past 3 weeks. I'm disappointed in the quality and warranty.",2
296331,"These shoes are super comfy and so cute!!  I wear a 7 so I ordered a 7 and they are perfect.  Also, they were packaged perfectly!!!  Which is very important with fringe booties.  The way they packaged them all the fringe was laying correctly and was crinkled.  Would definitely order from this company again!",5
846819,"So the new ""in"" thing is to wear chokers once again. For the price, this one is a good deal seeing that you get the necklace, ring and bracelet. The material is strechy and soft, so it won't be rubbing on yoiur skin and irritating it. If you want to be in style but not pay a lot, this product is for you!

* I receive this product at discount in exchange for an honest review*",4
376041,"My sister bought this bag as a beach bag for me, but I used it as a diaper bag all summer. It's very durable and cute, nice pockets inside, and easy to clean. I'm very happy with it and plan to use it next summer as a beach bag. Very spacious, holds a lot!",5
243368,"These are thicker, like cotton knit socks, not like panty hose, which is exactly what we were looking for. The white doesn't sparkle, but the black 'shoes' do. They have rubber grippers on the feet to help keep the baby from slipping, but they don't make it difficult to put shoes on (we put on black flats for walking outside). The only reason I didn't rate 5 stars is because after one wash, one of the bows came off in the washer. If you're decent at sewing, it could be easily reattached, or you could just remove the other now.",4
160760,I received this item and when I got it..it was open my item was not in the bag it was stolen and I wanna know what you plan to do about this because I paid my money for this and it was stolen and I mad as hell...I been waiting to long for it then when I got it...it wasn't there,1
165381,"I love these leggings! I ordered the ""purple impressions"" color, although they don't really look purple, they look much more blue than purple (see picture) I still love the color. They are very comfortable, and not see-through which is a major plus. I would definitely ordered these in other colors :)",4
478369,"The dress is different from the pictures. The lines on the dress are not like in the picture and the material is SUPERRRRR cheap. I wanted to return it and the seller refused to pay for shipping back, which doesn't make sense since the dress was NOT same as the picture. Would never buy from seller again. Don't waste money on something that is falsely advertised.",1
610517,"Buy a size up! I'm a size medium which translates to an XL for this, and it's pretty tight on me especially in the shoulder area. If you want your flannel to be comfortable and large enough to layer order another size up. Other than that this is a really thick, soft, and warm flannel. I will probably order again.",3
480736,"Excellent customer service and a terrific product at a terrific price.  I have a ton of waxed cotton from expensive labels like Barbour and House of Hardy, and this one is exactly right for what it is.  It has an inside pocket that is not mentioned in the description but is a good place for a wallet.
Remember, it isn't a 200 gilet, but at this price it is a winner!",5
707291,"They are a tight fit, which I like. It keeps my shin guards in place. Also the padded in the back is nice, but how many shots really hit the back of your leg. However, I bought these because I thought they were cut resistant. They are not. Worn them three times and already have a rip from a skate. Also, the stitching on the black part that connects the sock to undergarments is coming undone. Probably won't buy them again because they are pricey and not cut resistant like they said they were.",3
53251,"This seemed to be the perfect sun hat, but after just a few hours in a beach bag before we washed it it had molded and the mold won't come out. Not sure why it took on the mold so quickly but seems to be something wrong with the material.",1
448715,"I bought this dress for my dental school formal and received so many compliments for it. It is beautiful, elegant and sexy. The color is a bit more of an orange-red rather than the deep red. The Sheer length didn't bother me because there is a lot of fabric. I'm about 5'2, 112 lbs and I got size 6 based on their measurements chart. I had to alter a bit due to length, but again, I would recommend it if you want to stand out from the crowd",5
818950,I ordered this shirt for my husband. He wears XL but I read reviews so I ordered XXL then size was just right for him. But unfortunately the shirt had a large yellow stain around neck and buttons were very loose so I returned it. The seller accepted it and refound me quickly. You know I needed to pay $5 for the stamps to return the shirt so i wouldn't recommended to purchase this shirt...,3
79025,"I'm very pleased with my new leggings.  I have a hard time finding leggings that fit up around the waist.  If they don't fit around my waist they tend to slide down and I'm constantly tugging at them.  Most unbecoming in public.  These new leggings fit nicely around my waist and do not slip down.  I would highly recomment them.

Amazon is my go-to place to shop on line!!",5
112283,"I love the bracelet in this photo, but it isn't the one I received. And the one I did receive was broken when I received it. It is still pretty but much less my style. Don't get me wrong I will fix it and wear it but I'm disappointed it isn't what I ordered.",2
868773,"This bag was exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately when I opened the
Package, it smelled  awful. Like chemicals. I tried tossing it in the dryer with a dryer sheet. That didn't help. I then washed it and dried it, and that seemed to help for a day or two.  A few days later the smell was back. I should have just returned it but after washing it I didn't think they would take it back. It ended up in my dumpster",1
257187,I love the set itself. The colors and the feel to it are perfect but when it arrived it came with the bottom part ripped and falling apart. Strings everywhere. I am sending it back in hopes of getting another one in better condition but I do really LOVE how it looks on me.,3
224526,"It's definitely a cute shirt. Bought it to wear for a Halloween costume but will be wearing it for raves as well. Bought a large since a lot of the reviews said it ran small, I'm glad i did! I'm a 32DD and a large fits great on my chest but the waist is too big on me but I would rather have the bust fit and the waist be too big than the other way around. All around great shirt and I love the stretchy fabric :)",4
146138,"I was amazed at how awesome it looks. I wore it on my honeymoon while I was out and about exploring the town. Went in to some jewelry stores and the sales people kept telling my husband how expensive it was. They kept trying to get him to spend thousands of dollars on accessories to ""match"" the price tag of my wedding band.

I wear it regularly while working out (kickboxing with gloves on a lot of the time) and have not had any issues. Absolutely love it!",5
583896,ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS DRESS!  IT WAS WELL MADE AND DOUBLE STITCHED.  IT'S A STRETCHY MATERIAL THAT'S LIGHT AND COMFORTABLE BUT NOT SEE THROUGH.  I WILL BE ORDERING AGAIN FROM THEM.  IT ARRIVED ABOUT 10 DAYS EARLY AS WELL.  THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS HELPFUL AS WELL.,5
776271,"I purchased this for my son's Halloween costume. He is 4'11"" and weighs 84 lbs. I purchased the medium--I expected it to be a little big, and it is, but it is exactly what we need. The shirt came in great packaging and arrived quickly. Great product and great seller!",5
832075,"Size chart is way off! I bought XL as my usual size would be L, and I want a swimsuit cover-up to be nice and loose. Arms were fine but the body of the thing barely reaches to side of breasts. How annoying! Yet another item I have to return because of incorrect sizing info",1
553665,"Came with a terrible, terrible odor!  I could not even store in our closet with our clothes! Hung them outside on the porch fan for over a week!  Finally they were odorless!  And they are great little belts. I love them and they seem to be sturdy enough to me. Great versatile colors. Some reviewers said they were cheap and flimsy. I disagree. Can not beat them for the price. Now they are my favourites! One star off for. having to air them to make them usable.",4
735292,"This was slightly smaller than expected. Also, the straps do not stay in place, which makes it a little uncomfortable. It seems to be due to where the straps are attached in the back.
Other than that, the snap for the front is easy to remove and reattach and it holds the nursing pads in place.",4
135427,"I have a terrible time keeping warm during the winter especially in the house, with this jacket I can layer it for when I go outside and when I am inside I can wear it and its not really big and thick that it gets in the way of me doing things. Awesome buy thanks",5
866088,"Color said turquoise, it is definitely a true blue.  I ordered a large for my bestfriend. It definitely runs small.  Also, the design and lettering is kind of a cheap iron on.  It doesn't look like it will hold up through too many washes.  It arrived on time though.",2
667017,"This dress was a weird fit. I ordered a Medium and they sent me a Large due to the differences in sizes between USA and China, however it was too large, and it didn't stay up. The dress has pretty sequins, but it is poorly made, there's no liner so it's really itchy-  and they fall off everywhere. Not impressed.",3
113241,These worked great for a Halloween costume. They fit well and I had no troubles with the finger loops. They are bright on one side and quite a bit lighter on the other (color printed only on one side I think). This didn't bother me for the price I paid.,4
312143,I would've given this 5 stars because the product itself is great. The backs work perfectly and don't fall off.  The only reason for the 3 star review is that unfortunately they are on the expensive side since you only get 2 in an order.  That being said. I have ordered these more than once because I needed more than 2,3
339548,"These are cool to look at but freaking stupid to put on. They screw on from the back, so not only can you not see what you are doing but you can't even get them on. And they broke the first time I tried. I'm just glad they didn't cost a whole lot.",1
127931,"I was afraid to order these shorts since people were saying they were ""too small"". I usually wear 4/5 in bottoms so I ordered a large & they fit just fine. Also, I was surprised how fast I got them because they came in the mail a week later. Overall, these shorts are really cute & I would highly recommend them!",5
165309,"I wear leggings a lot and these are my favorite cropped-length leggings.  I think there is a difference between capris and cropped, and I prefer the latter, finding it longer.  I usually wear a M and considered ordering these in L, but I'm glad I got the M's.  I ordered some bright colors that are great for summer.  These leggings are NOT see-through and some might consider them heavy, but I love how strong they are.",5
411208,"i loved these shoes! They actually aren't for myself, I got them as a gift for my sister, but we wear the same shoe size and they fit both of us! Her foot is wider and since these are men shoes they fit her perfectly! The size was right on, as far as men to woman size goes. The quality of the shoes were good too! Very satisfied.",5
439208,"I was surprised when it came in a tiny box, but when I opened it, I was pleasantly surprised. There was no tag in it, so I am only to assume that these blouses are made to order?  Materials should hold up well as they are not natural fibers.",5
829963,"I went with the advice from other reviews to go a couple sizes up and am pleased with the fit overall, except I would like a bit more room in the chest area.  The panels above the faux pockets, wrinkle a bit on me. Perhaps a half size larger for me would have been a perfect fit. But overall I like it alot. I will wear it with the sleeves pushed up.",4
847931,"These are high waist, elastic pants. I like the material. My size is 8 and ordered M; but it was too loose; not skinny. Actually my mom, who has hips at size 12, started wearing it. So I strictly advise you to buy one size smaller then your actual size, if you are looking for skinny jeans.",4
543171,Sizes run small. But I wear a wife beater underneath.so not a waste of $3/4. Summersale again. I would buy more if I could get the right size. Im xtrasmall and ordered small. C ant beat the price and they are cute. But need to know go 1-2 sizes up. Cause no returns.,4
332166,"I love then look of these so much! They are pretty hard to get in, though. I'm a 00, and they were a little too big on either end - they were painful to put in. BUT, once in, they look amazing! Super smooth and they have a nice weight to them. I will definitely be buying more!",5
28875,I was having real foot pain for the first time in my life. I looked all over the internet for an over the counter solution. These are the best on the market as far as I concerned. I have a 13 foot with an medium to low arch and these do the trick.,5
203286,Bought it for my 12 year old niece. She loved it but the chain was a little cheap and not put together on the purse. Not a big deal but a little inconvenient. The leather on the chain was twisted and coming out of the chain in some places so it took some time to put it back the way it looks in the picture. But the purse was sturdy enough and looks really nice. She loves it.,4
433625,These Skele-Toes are getting very hard to find but without a doubt the most comfortable shoes in the world.  I have to take whatever color is offered just to get them.  Will never understand why Fila discontinued manufacturing these shoes.  My favorite brand and style of shoe.,5
316505,"Very disappointing. This slip is much too short and does not have adjustable straps. I'm only 5' 5"".  It's too short to show beneath the hem of my short dresses, and even my tunics! Not sure I can use it, unless I hem it up a tad bit and use it with a regular length top.  It may work as a slip for someone much shorter than my average height.",2
788699,"Very nice LBD.  The material was surprising to me for the price.  It is almost like a ponte knit, thick and stretchy, very nice!  I ordered the SMALL, I am 5'1"" and 115 lbs.  It does fit snug, but still comfortable.  It hits right below the knee.  Love it.",4
240249,"This ring looks and feels like my white gold band, only this one being comfort fit is so much more comfortable to wear every day. I also love that it comes in half sizes. I wear a 7.5 and they can be hard to find. This ring has a nice weight to it, and it is beautiful and shiny. I am very pleased with this purchase.",5
775621,"Size XL. The shirt has a somewhat weird fit. It's a thinner material, so it hugs your body, which isn't good for someone with man boobs. It also flairs out on the bottom some. The logo is lower and smaller than pictured. The material feels nice enough. If you have more of an athletic build, it'd probably fit fine.",2
156234,Awesome wallet! I have always been a bi-fold leather wallet kind of guy and have decided to down size and be more with the times and after much review and almost buying wallets that were over 200$ this one looked better than those wallets so I figured I'd give it a shot. And I'm not disappointed at all! Such a great wallet! Also looks even better in the black version!!,5
879393,"This is a couple of inches too tall for me (I'm 5'0"" so it's no shock to me) but it fits fabulously around the shoulders and bust. If I were to change one thing, it would be to add a faux tank flap across the chest because the sides (which need to pull down to allow feeding access) will fall open when you lean down to pick up your baby.",5
216985,"Far and away the best $12 hat I've ever bought!  The fit runs a little large and the hat was a little bent when it got here, but it's a great hat. If it last through the summer that would be awesome, but if it doesn't I'll buy another.",5
405304,"I ordered this bracelet and was surprised by it because I did not expect such a nice looking and good quality product for the low price. However, I was proven wrong and found it is both good looking and high quality. Also, fast shipping and good service from seller. Highly recommend it.",5
720011,"This headband was very gorgeous. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because one of the stones had fallen out before I even opened the package. Thankfully, the stone was loose in the package, so I'm just going to hot glue it in place before my wedding day. Other than that, for the price paid, this headband is gorgeous!!",4
386536,I really enjoy this bra! it is thick like the high quality lululemon sports bras I have and has the same type of padding. I do strength training and I feel very secure when I workout in this. The T-strap bra is very flattering. I'd definitely recommend this to a friend!,5
227858,Looked good and was shipped quickly...  BUT the back side attaching piece never held onto the pin that pokes through the tie!!!  Never used it once.  I started the return process but it would've cost as much as the tie tack did so I just threw it away.,2
474489,"Love the dress, love the quality and love the fit. They made a special effort for me to get it in time for my event, sooner then predicted shipping date. They were able to customize to my size needs as I'm quite tall. Cry halt with their customer service and would buy from them again in a heart beat. Reasonable prices too!!",5
589198,"It was two small, the fabric is not at all like it is shown here and also the color. The bottoms are hard to open an close. The worst thing is that there is two black pen line over in at front part of the cloth and I can not return that.",1
167279,"Thick, comfortable, not see through in anyway. I have 8 pairs and now on Amazon trying to find more as I can't find them anywhere. They are the best yoga pant I've ever had, especially for the price. And you can't see if I've sweat in them or not. Great pant!",5
426283,"I don't know what that guy is talking about saying the company isn't good. I got a ring that sent to the wrong address because of my mistake and they sent it to the right one, then I got the wrong ring size, so I sent it back and asked for a different size, and they did everything wonderfully. The company is really good in my opinion!",5
578326,"Although we had issues with this coat, I have to say that Egelbel went above and beyond to make sure we were satisfied with our purchase. After dealing with them I would not hesitate to order from them again. I will say like others order at least 2 sizes larger than normal",3
387250,"The skirt was too large, I usually wear a xl size 14 and picked a xxl for some reason.  I still wore it because of not enough time for an exchange but i pinned it and it was fine because it was a pleated and no one noticed.  I love the skirt I will purchase it in the right size. It is short so not for the faint of heart.  My gluteus is fairly big so it was short.  over all I like it for the price I was very happy with the skirt",4
132579,"Only a little big on my head, but I'm 25, so I can see this being way too big foe a small child. But I do have a small head as well.

I did not expect this to look so good. Mine has a very small defect at the eye stitching where the red shows on the wrong side, but it's barely noticeable. Very well made. I got lots of compliments on it on Halloween, both from people who did and didn't know the character. I can see myself wearing this as my actual hat throughout the year.",5
747130,"Looks nice, washed well (cold water wash on delicate, laid flat to dry on drying rack). My daughter likes it, though I wish it were warmer for her (she cares more about looks than being warm); I'm glad it has a hood.
I can't remember what size I ordered, but I think it will show up on the review. It fits her well, she is 5' tall and around 90 lbs.",4
5695,It's a little tighter than I expected.  I wear 36x36 of Carhartt's Loose Fit jeans and that fits perfectly.  These 36x36 Loose Fit Carpenter pants are a little too tight.  I'm not going to return it.  I'm planning on getting skinnier anyways.  So at least I'll have something to wear then.,3
864475,"These are cute, soft, and fit well but after the first washing they faded dramatically. Since I wash everything before wearing, they were too faded looking to use in our photo shoot, which is what I bought them for. I guess the faded look is ok with jeans and a tee shirt? You get what you pay for. I won't be purchasing again.",2
301342,"These pjs are absolutely adorable. My one year old daughter loves alligators, so I got her a gift including these, an alligator bath toy, and alligator book. These are her favorite, she keeps pointing to them saying ""gator"". I love that they are not your typical girly pjs, but just enough with the soft pink. Great quality and perfect fit as well. Thanks!",5
618705,"What was delivered did not match the description.  I did still receive a similarly distinguished and great looking watch but without the white stitching and much to my disappointment, no luminosity to the numbers or hands.  Additionally the case back appears to be for a completely different brand called Engrwolf.  I have not tested the water resistance.  Gave 3 stars because it's still a very nice watch and I've received many compliments on it.  Just wish the description and photos accurately represented what I would receive.",3
254139,Great for the clearance price of $9 but I wouldn't pay full price for this product. I purchased 2 for my children to play with. They are extremely easy to extend but somewhat difficult for little hands to collapse as they get stuck. Trying to collapse them myself I jammed my nail when they suddenly snapped down. Overall it's a fun light saber for children and totally worth the sale price.,4
44859,Beautiful..soft. Lots of compliments.  Kept my baby warm all winter.  My baby was petite and so this fit from 3 months to 8 months and got her through the whole winter.  It is wonderful because it actually stays on her head.  I am planning on getter her a larger one for a trip to the east coast in the Fall (read: chilly).  I love that it could be worn by a boy or a girl (which is great considering how pricey it is).,5
652879,"I love these leggings! They are so comfy & buttery soft! I would give 5 stars but I  think it's a stretch to call these plus size. I am 6-8 petite pants. I ordered these based on other reviews. I don't like my leggings really tight, so these were perfect. I guess high waist means not low rise. These hit me right at the waist. They run very small.",4
443793,"I got this for my wife (Rosie), and she really likes it. The contrasting colors with the gold trimmings is a very pretty sight. She put it in a vase with another (solid) gold rose that she already had, and the two together are a great pair. Bu itself, or with a bunch more, this rose is a great buy.
Highly recommended.",5
756252,My son is a Back to the Future fan. Bought it as a surprise and he was shocked! He loved the feel of the shirt as well as the AWESOME look! On the Back it says Back to the Future which is really cool too. Thanks for such a great shirt. I got the shirt super fast too!! Thanks again.,5
131860,After reading other reviews I got a sense of how the top would fit and love it.  It's hard to purchase tops on-line since I can wear anywhere from small to large depending on the make of the top.  I'm 5 5  aprrox 140 lbs and the Medium/ US10 fits me great.,4
549048,"I really like the fit and initially really liked the fabric for being so soft. The fabric is really not great in the end because of the way it holds odors. After one wear, by the end of the day, my crotch reeks. I'd love to update you on the post-wash quality, but the stench really dampens my enjoyment of these briefs. Sure, I've smelled my odor with other briefs but this set really amps up the stink level.",3

I was able to fit a key, lip gloss, a Galaxy S7, and a couple credit cards in it if I angled them all just right.  The sides have a smooth finish and don't snag my chiffon dress, which surprised me some it's covered in stones. It catches the light well and is so sparkly; I can't wait to use it at an upcoming military ball.",5
225970,I am around 5'2 and 110lbs and the small fits me perfectly. I did not have an issue with the zipper yet and the skirt does go past my knees. The skirt came very nicely packaged in a ziploc bag. The material felt nice and I love the embroidery on the fabric. My only complaint is that the skirt's color rubbed off onto my white shirt and white shorts that I had worn under the dress. So be careful about wearing your light colored clothes with this skirt & also be careful when you wash it.,5
595770,"I ended up ordering a size that was slightly too large thinking I might need to account for size discrepancies. It is still a very cute top, although it needed a good wash right away as it smelled as though it had been stored in a musty cellar upon arrival.",5
590882,"You know the saying ""you get what you pay for?"" Well it doesn't apply here. In this case you get much much less. Where to start?
1. No padding- you can actually feel the wire digging into you.
2. Color is misrepresented- Looks washed out.
3. All in all the worst product I have ever seen.",1

Gorgeous Bridal is wonderful to deal with, May answered all of my emails and questions promptly and kindly. They got the dress, made to my daughter's measurements, in under 6 weeks (all the time her school gave us... grrr) and they shipped it so fast I can't believe it! I would absolutely recommend this seller and this beautiful dress!",5
724451,just got this yesterday and it fits small...i have thick curly hair so if i put it on it feels like is going to pop back off..also it does not come in a box so it will have some dents in it but you can just pop it back out,3
363514,"I ordered this based on the favorable reviews.  It was very, very, very cheaply made.  The material used to make this item is NOT the typical fabric used for swim suits.  I""m 5'9 and 175lbs, ordered a large and it did not fit well at all.  The design is cute, but the quality is sub par to put it nicely. I would NOT recommend this to anyone I know.  You're better off getting a modestly priced set from your local department store.",1
398555,"I knew that Minnetonka tends to run large, so that wasn't a surprise. Great quality! However, these booties are heavy for an infant and it is difficult to keep them on. They way these are made also make it difficult for the shoes to stay closed. Suede is not the smartest material to put on a drooling baby, either. He loves to eat them!  But, they are absolutely adorable!!!!",4
809367,"I usually wear a small, but since it was made in China, I decided to go up a size just in case. I think the long sleeve is really adorable and funny. I don't particularly like the type of fabric that was used to make the shirt, but overall I think my money was very well spent. :)",5
134699,"I bought these for the pretty design, but they also turned out to be high-quality socks. They're not too thin (so they keep the feet warm) but are not too thick and bulky that they make your boots tighter when you wear them. The elastic is tight enough to stay put on your calves, but not too tight that it cuts into your legs. (I have wider than average calves and that is a typical problem I run into. Not with these socks!)",5
331709,"The screws are a bit hard to turn, I had to use my own screwdriver with a bigger handle but no big deal. The leather punch I'm not 100% sure the need of. Maybe if it was too small or too big, but it fits fine for me. Only thing I'd say to take note of is that the silver is like a mirror chrome finish, not brushed.",5
211771,"I love these glasses. They fit great, very comfortable. The tint is not too dark, obscuring light which can be dangerous and I do not feel my eyes strained. As a matter a fact, it gives you a nice crisp look at your surroundings, but still provides shade from the harsh sun. I receive a lot of compliments and I highly recommend these glasses. I am buying another pair!!

634270,"Fits me perfect. I am  standard size 8. The one size fits all would not work for larger sizes. I also ordered the navy blue. Set the dye before you wear it. It bleeds. I found this out because I wash every thing before I wear it. Everyone should do that because fabric has preservatives in it , sometimes including formaldehyde. Just wash in a bath of salt and vinegar, this will set in the dye.",5
770259,"The bag looks and feels awesome. I was totally pumped when I took it out of the box and started switching items from my old bag. Super excited, this bag is just great. Got everything switched over, put the bag on my shoulder, and saw a major default. One of the little support buttons on the bottom of the bag, there are five of them, was missing. Talk about disappointment. The rest of the bag of so well-made, for this to be missing is just a shame.",2
140086,I tried this sweater on a couple of times but it is just awful. It is extremely poofy at the bottom and doesn't sit right. It is not cute; it just looks like a big poofy mess at the bottom. It doesn't look like a cute or nice sweater at all. The design is nice but the quality and sewing? A definite no.,1
795362,"This is a pretty dress and feels good too but it is way too tight.  I ordered a small and my daughter wears a size 4.  It was so tight that she could not wear it to work.  This is a cute dress but order a size up for the best fit.

I received this dress at no cost in exchange for an honest review.",4
316529,"Do not buy this skirt unless you are really skinny. It is a beautiful skirt and it is well made of good material but, and I'm sure you would know that there had to be a but, if it doesn't fit it will cost you over one hundred dollars to return it.",1
480252,"I like the earrings overall but I have an issue with the manufacturer and their quality control standards. We have ordered 3 different style types of Aggie earrings from this same manufacturer and we have had to send one back 2 out of 3 times to get replacements for poor quality with the stamping, the post, or the shape of the hoops that weren't the same! So buyer beware, that they are nice if you can get ones that look good the first time around.",3
722608,"im a size 8 US sizes, i got a large and they fit great!  they're a little stretchy too which is perfect. however, they're not as high rise as they look in the picture, it comes up to my belly button - in the picture it looks like it goes up to the bottom of your ribs... still i love them.",5
552450,"I'm 5'2, 105 lbs, normally a 32 B (small) on top, and a size medium in bottoms - so I ordered the S/M size. I realized that it was kind of a gamble, but I went for it anyways. Both the top and the bottoms have tags that say they're both medium. The top was WAY too big, and the bottoms were a bit too tight. Apparently my butt is a size large in China. I would return it, but it probably wouldn't be worth it to ship it back over there. Glad I know how to sew.",1
97099,"This shirt is very hip and fashion forward! It fits perfectly and it looks long in the picture but at the bottom of the shirt, it actually has stretchy band at the bottom so it lays perfectly at whatever height you want it to. Very comfortable and well made. Highly suggested.",5
29216,"I've been wearing this style of Jockey briefs for about 20 years. Over-priced, but the most comfortable, best fitting I've found. I recently ordered four more. They still fit well. Despite what one reviewer wrote, the front liner is still present. In the black ones the liner is now also black, not the traditional white. Without looking closely one can think the liner is no longer present. The grey briefs still have the white liner. So far, the quality still seems fine.",5
334645,"I will upload a picture later on but I was just not please with the fit. It wasn't snugged and that's what I was looking for. Maybe it's because I don't have enough hips so there was a huge gap in the backside area. However, the skirt came in great condition and it is the skirt that's pictured I am simply not keeping the item because it's not the look I was looking for.",3
447245,One of the earrings was broken.  The link that was supposed to hold the two pieces together was missing.  It was like that before I even opened the plastic so obviously who ever packed them knew it was broken!!!  With plastic in the description I shouldn't have been surprised..junk don't waste your time or money on these earrings!,1
534947,"The length as size was as expected, but it was wide/puffy in the arms, which was an awkward fit for me since I'm bigger chested and have skinnier arms.  The wash is lighter then expected. These are Korean/asian sizes, so they run very small. Im a dress size 4 and got a large.",3
567387,I love the sweater. I typically wear a large sweater and ordered the largest size available (XXL which is supposed to fit a US Size 12) and it fits perfectly. The sweater is super cute with the little hearts on the elbows. It shipped and arrived much quicker than was noted on Amazon.,5
765395,"Pros: Fits Perfectly, the Saslax Suit gives good coverage on the bottom, very comfortable, doesn't ride up even though I have a long torso. Bright and  colorful, beautiful Retro Style.  Cons: the bust cups are stiff so they give an awkward shape to the bosom. I purchased this a discount in exchange for a fair and honest review.",4
425531,"This style purse has six outside pockets and another three inside with a large zippered section.  So easy to organize!  The pattern with navy and orchid colors goes casual with jeans or off to work during the week. It can't get much better than this.  However, I've been so happy with the last two I've gotten.  I'll be checking on all the patterns from now on.",5
282645,It actually fits pretty good. I thought I had picked the wrong size at first and when I opened it from the package I got scared because it look kind of long but looks better when you have it on. The head part I am a little bothered with since it looks lumpy but I'll see what I can do. It's also kind of see through so I would suggest wearing something under it but overall it looks good.,4
20079,"I bought this for my 6wk old baby. I took a chance thinking it may not fit. Size description is vague (0-6 months). I was surprised to see that hat has a draw string so you can make it smaller around the head to fit the baby. So it fits!! They should mention this draw string on description, they would sell more.",5
303833,Wonderful little ring.  I wear this when I'm engaged in activities that might put my gold ring at risk.  I've had this a few months now and it is still shiny.  Being made of Tungsten (and being rather thick) it is a bit heavier than rings I have worn in the past.  This is not a distraction though.,5
470363,"This is actually quite nice, and the styling and print on the fabric are authentic Japanese.  It looks good with a t-shirt and jeans, and maybe a nice statement necklace.  It is very whispy, sort of like wearing a scarf.  There are threads dangling here and there, but I just trim them off, no big deal.",4
120297,"I just put this on my 2 year old son to go swimming and we loved it.  I ordered the xl size, he weighs about 23 pounds.  It fits great and he loves the car design.  It has a diaper lined right inside it so you don't need to use a diaper and then the swim shorts.  So easy to get on and off, less bulk than the other way.",5
428452,"Cute and simple accessory for work outfits. I don't really know what to do with the loose, extra strand that hangs after clipping this around my waist though. I kind of tuck it back into the belt and sometimes it looks okay that way. I've gotten compliments on it, so. It will fit literally any girl's waist, petites and plus size alike, though petites may not enjoy the long extra strand of slack. Overall, it does the job of uplifting a simple outfit.",4
320021,"The top fits perfectly & is comfortable. The bottom is a bit large but it is ""one-size"". I'll be tailoring the gold straps on the side to fit a little smaller. The outfit comes with basic looking brown boyshorts, but if you don't want to wear the shorts underneath the fabric is not too sheer so you can't see thru it. The ""chain"" is quite small & delicate looking, not so slave like but I suppose that's just my opinion.",5
142362,"I was very happy with these pants! The material is exactly as described and they are true to size. I wear a size 5, ordered a 5 and they are perfect for me. However I'm pretty short so they scrunch up a lot at the bottom for me. However, I like that in skinny jeans. I plan on wearing these a lot and will probably buy more of this product!",5

461115,"Bought for a head diameter measuring about 51"", but was way too big. The elastic of the band is very subtle; this is I guess so the pressure isn't too much and cause discomfort, but in practice, it slips off the head easily. The material of the band holds on to hers and scarves well, but the band itself slips off. Did not work for my use so it was returned.",2
476456,"These are on the small side but they are good. I am 5'10"" and 145lbs and they fit me fine.

If you want loose stockings that you can quickly pull/claw/tug on then maybe get something that's made of sporty durable material, or  like some of those fall sweater style tights. You do have to treat these with care, and put them on delicately- they're sort of like old fashioned stockings that were easier to put a run in. But it's not about them being too small, it's about how gently you treat them.",5
548567,"Don't ever buy this sweater! If I could give it zero stars I would. There is no ""front"" or ""back"" to the sweater so it feels weird and uncomfortable when you put it on. The elbow patches are located way above your elbows and the sweater falls short on my torso. I'm 5'5"" and 125lbs so maaaybe it could work if you are super tiny. Or if you have super high elbows and are looking for a crop top then go for it, otherwise, don't buy this. Epic fail.",1
613834,"This bag looks and feels good.  I purchased it as carry on luggage for international air travel.  It appears to be sturdy and well made.  I think that it will serve me well.  After my travels, it will be good for daily use, as I like to carry a large bag.",4
584516,"I love the quality and the feel of the hat. The leather is soft a comfortable, yet durable. The quality of the workmanship is evident as soon as you take it out of the box. I've only been able to wear it in limited situations so far but it have performed well in the cold and rain. I look forward to wearing it this Spring and Summer and seeing how much heat it does or doesn't retain. All in all I am happy with my purchase.",5
806743,"These nose rings were very pretty and seemed to be made of nice materials.  I really wanted it to work out, I swear I did!!  Lol, sadly these are a little to big for my nose and where the actual piercing is placed on my nostril.  If you like a SLIGHTLY larger hoop, this would be the nose jewlery for you.  However if you have a smaller nose or a low piercing, these might be a little too big.",4
276113,"There is nothing wrong with these sunglasses.  That being said, you get what you pay for.  They feel pretty cheap, and fit a bit large, but work perfectly well.  They aren't incredible, but they're better than comparably priced sunglasses that you can get at a local convenience store.",3
6371,"These are a great choice for people who need durable work pants, but want something that is lightweight and breathes.  The mushroom color is also really nice.  I have purchased several pairs of these exact pant, as I work on airplanes and they get put through the wringer with wear and grease.  They hold up and still look good, I love them.",5
34653,"I expected a much smaller purse for the price, but it is VERY nice and roomy; I still haven't filled it up, which was a surprise to me.  There are plenty of separate storage areas, more than I've had before, and it is probably the handiest and most convenient purse I've ever had.",5

The costume without it can be used as train engineer as well apparently because that is what other people thought. Lol",5
513342,I ordered this same top in pink but later discovered it was made by a different manufacturer. The pink one fit perfectly but this one (which was ordered in the exact same size) is a little smaller. So be aware of that. Otherwise it's comfortable and very cute with leggings.,3

It wasn't damaged during shipping because the packaging was in good condition.  The washer did not get out the stain but did lighten it. It's still wearable, but I was a bit disappointed. The shirt is cute, but poor quality control.",2
418210,"It's hard to find cute clip-on earrings, so when I found these I was so excited. They are just the right size and really pretty when you look at all the designs on them. The clip-ons kinda hurt after wearing them for a long time, but they're more comfortable than a lot of clip-on earrings. The only thing I'm worried about is the possibility of these earrings breaking, since they don't seem to be tooooo sturdy.",4
40446,"Great Great Product!

I bought this product in 2002  or 2003 when i bought new running shoes. I sprayed this product onto my new shoes and a flashy handbag, today i still use my shoes for everything (hiking, running, walking, and other dirty work) and they are less than half as dirty than my walking shoes i bought less than a year ago that i did not spray.

will buy soon again, just ran out today : (",5

That said, they give a moderate amount of support for everyday wear during pregnancy. If you are working with varicosities, I would recommend them in combination with other support under-things.",3
413967,"Received and larger than anticipated but really like it.  It has an inside pocket, and two outside pockets.  The outside pockets do not close and wish it had velcro closures but still a great style and design.  The pocketbook is roomy and sturdy and doesn't collapse when placing on a table like so many do these days.  I and would recommend this purchase to others.  Great color and considering buying this same brand in another style/color.  Very pleased with quality and color.",5

The tent is so light that you almost cant see it, to be honest I don't know if there was even a blue tent to them.  I wouldn't buy again just not worth it to me.  I will say my nephew I gave them to (has a wide head) and he thought they were cool.",2

639032,I ordered a 4x after reading reviews thinking it should surely fit since I normally wear a 2x. I am disappointed to say it did not fit. Not even close. The fit was more like a ladies medium. However they do have good customer service so I give them 3 stars,3
566288,"Ehh, This wasn't one of my better buys..... The material has balled up already after one wash. It's not as flowy as it seems in the picture but for the price I expected that. It's amateur but worth the price, so I'll deal with it, pretty sure it may only last three weeks of this upcoming summer, then I'm tossing it or donating it. Still it came earlier than expected so that's cool.",2

It has also proven sturdy even when I've super-stuffed my suitcase.

So far I've only checked it once, and (despite a scuff on the plastic buckle) it held up really well. Will update if it gets damaged as checked luggage.",5

They are extremely comfortable. I don't notice that I'm wearing them. They do what they're supposed to do.",4

Well I tried to put it on and I couldn't even get it pass down my boobs. Material is really thin so I was scare to even force it to pull it down.,2
346728,The dress was great and fits really well much more like a very expensive dress.  I ordered both the black and the gold but was washed out in the gold.  Went with the black and loved it.  I'm typically a 12/14 and wear a 34F/G and I have a regular bra on with the dress that is low in front and it was not a problem at all.,5
457661,"Soft fabric makes the feel if these comfortable. They've stretched to become more comfortable over time, so I'm thankful for that. My only complaint is the cut of the pockets, they're constantly showing the white inner fabric no matter how much I push them in. As comfortable as the pants are, I wish the waistline was more forgiving, it's a bit tighter than the rest of the pants that have stretched comfortably.",3
845412,"I purchased these from their Amazon reviews! Thanks to everyone for taking the time to review them. They fit great, feel nice, and worked great!  I especially liked the generous nonslip coating inside the sock. I never had to adjust them once nor did they every slip while wearing them!",5
842489,"This dress took a while for it too come and it was way too small. I got this dress for my graduation party because I liked the back design, but it was too short for me to wear. I could have sized up, but I just didn't have the time, and it wasn't worth it to me for the little that I paid. The material is cheap and seems that it could tear easy. I wouldn't buy again even if I did size up.",1
67769,"Title says it all,  worth the money as the quality is very nice.  I purchased the ""What Katie Did L2010 Maitresse Black Narrow Suspender Belt UK 14/ US 10/ FR 42/ EU 40 Black Sold by Mio Destino"" and like the style much better. They only make it in black.  This was the closest I could find by the same designer.",5
805282,"The strap snapped and ripped off my first night wearing it.. talk about an AWKWARD moment.. the company was amazing in solving the issue however and overall the outfit was super cute while it lasted! Maybe it was just the one product, I wouldn't let it stop you from buying it and feeling sexy and beautiful for a night!",3
177236,"I thought it was the same all the way around, but not.  The colored chiffon is only on the front.  The back is just plain flat white.  I will probably never wear it. This is one of those items that look good in the picture but are disappointing when you get them.",3
657965,"Top was and looks cheap. It's the incert that does the top no justice. The incert/ modisty lining is not cut correctly and you can see the uneven line when u wear the shirt. The lining it short, unevenly cut and only it connected at the top of the shirt. I will either cut this lining or just toss this top in the trash.",1
494594,"I got this by accident and I'm glad I did. First off, I received it in one week when the shipping estimated I wouldn't get it until next month. It fits perfectly, comfortably and is really cute. I love them! I can barely feel them and I even did cartwheels to see how well they would hold and they didn't budge. I definitely will be checking out the other products from this company.",5
418462,"Waterproof and fits well, but likely not durable. For occasional use it's ok. Collapses to fit a small space so fairly easy to take along just in case. If you usually avoid riding in rain and want something for those few times when the weather turns nasty and you're caught by surprise, these will suffice. But, the seams are just heat welded and the entire construction looks weak enough that these would fail with frequent use or stress.",3
27999,"Use these in my old Nike athletic shoes on top of the original insole to mow the lawn. Before I put these in my heel was killing me the next morning after mowing. Now no more pain the next day.  Coupled with my compression sock at night my heel pain is gone in three months. And I'm 63 years old, how about that!",5
271469,"For the price I was extremely shocked that this product was so great! I read a ton of reviews saying that the cop hat was bad quality, but honestly mine seems to be just fine! The handcuffs aren't the best quality but considering all of these items together were only $20 I was very impressed. Everything fits great and I am 5'6, 145 pounds, and size 34D bra. Definitely recommend if you're rolling on a budget :)",5
612912,"I wanted to love this shirt. It seemed perfect for summer. But when it came in it was just too tight. I ordered the XL to allow for enough room to be a little loose, but it was too small right out of the pack. I had to send it back unfortunately. I would love to have this style in a little looser fit.",2
288592,"These are amazing, and so is the seller. I ordered one pair, but one of the clips wasn't tight. The seller immediately sent me a whole new set.

As for the product: I wear button down shirts for work near exclusively. I teach and am always reaching up to write on the board or kneeling down to talk to a student. My shirts were never staying put. I've tried other brands, but these work the best. It can be a shoulder workout (resistance training as you pull against the elastic), but hey, not exactly a problem.",5
599429,"Purchased an XL and it was too tight in the gut for me. I am 6'2"" 130 lbs. with a 36"" waist and around a 40"" gut. Loved the shirt and badge. Well made. Neck was a bit tight and the material does not breath well. I am purchasing another in XXL and hopeful that it will be large enough for my gut. It is difficult to find clothes at times since the upper portion fit well and going sizes larger tend to allow room in the gut and too large up top.",5
327245,"My boyfriend Kalvin (who I share this account with) bought this for me. It didn't fit QUITE well. I will admit I have a very small waist, so I am perhaps an extreme. But the outfit didn't cling to my body at all. It was oddly loose on my sides where my waist is, and also a little loose in the shoulders/armpits.

That being said, still got the job done ;) Doesn't have to fit perfectly to still be a sexy design.",3
661796,"By far, this is one of the best Disney T-shirts I own.  The quality is superb. The fit is just a little tiny bit too big but that gives me room to move around in it.  It washes up beautifully. You would expect to spend $30 or more for the shirt in Disneyland/Disney World.",5
118951,"I ordered this ""dress"" for an upcoming event, but was very disappointed when it arrived. This is a top and not a dress. The material is very thin and it is extrememly short. You can see right through it. Very poor, cheap material. The shipping was fast, but too costly to send back.",2
598453,I was really worried that it wasn't going to get here in time and that it was going to look cheap and completely different from the picture but fortunately I was wrong! It arrived on time and it the dress was BEAUTIFUL! I wore it for my boyfriend's graduation party and everyone loved my dress. Classy and sexy,5
76026,"I'm almost 7 months pregnant now and bought this when I was about 4 months. I use it daily and I'm so happy I bought this instead of buying maternity clothing. I bought a couple other belly bands and they were HORRIBLE compared to the quality of this.

Still just as stretchy as the day I bought it.",5
11823,"Seems to work well with my fallen arches. I initially thought that the arch support would not be rigid enough for my weight so I tried placing some small gel supports in the space beneath the insole's arch, but that setup got a bit uncomfortable after a while.. So I took my improvised additional support out and now it is much more comfortable.  It turns out that the way it was designed, with a rigid yet somewhat flexible arch support, actually works better for my feet.",5
398338,"My then 8 and now 9 year old son loves this helmet. He originally used it to dress up for Halloween.  But this is much nicer than a Halloween costume. He has since used it for career day and to betray people of history in a school program. He has also used it in just imagenitive play. Great astrount helmet! Also you can hear radio control when you wear the helmet and push a button. It was also used in the movie ""Wonder"".",5
658040,"The band is comfortable to wear and looks pretty good although the stitching looks cheap.  The rings flop around; just like in the picture.  Sometimes, this causes the band that I have tucked into the second loop to come out and flop around.  The leather is thin but very soft.  I am a little afraid it will wear out easily, but so far, so good.",4
678980,"Cheap cheap cheap quality.  I wear size medium shirts and size 12 pants and a C cup bra and ordered this in a large.  First off, unless you already have boobs that touch your chin, don't expect this thing to give you any lift whatsoever.  As soon as I tried to tie the ribbon to close the garment it tore.  You get what you pay for, that's for sure.",1
476549,"Nice to find the same pair, albeit different color, of Nike Exofit mid workout shoes on amazon.com. I used to wear these to walk/workout/light running back in the 1980s when these first came out, and they were/are extremely comfortable and provide a stable support system to the foot. Not for heavy-duty running or jogging, but just fine for general wear and working out (weight training, etc.). Recommended!",4
80571,my kids loved em to say the least. and I love that they are a bit better than the dollar store stuff. still broke pretty fast. but after the 5th one my almost 3 year old figured out she had to stop doing certain things to keep them from breaking. so really it wasn't 100% the products fault..,4
863141,Nice dress.  Runs a little bit on the small side.  Great for all seasons because the material is good.  Shoulder width is best for petite women.  This is closer to Asian sizing than American sizing.  Lovely dress.  Great for parties.  Long enough so it's not revealing.  Sleeves come down a decent length too.  I got this free in exchange for an unbiased review.  GOOD,4
259446,This product is horrible. It doesn't even seem like it was made to fit a human. The arm straps are in very weird and unflattering locations and the sizing is way off. I do not think this product would fit any shape human and it was tight and hideous looking. I highly doubt the model in the picture is wearing this company's version of this product and would assume it is some terrible knockoff version of what is pictured. Despite the extremely low price I would not recommend anyone buy this product. It is awful and unwearable,1
716902,The pic gave the impression of a formal dress. The fabric seems thick but it's really thin. Going to make some alterations to the back and the slit at the side by adding lace. It fits me similar to how the model looks. It's cheap so I really bother myself about the quality of the fabric . I think they name the type of fabricthat was used and state the quality as well.,2
148384,"the quantity is great for the price but the product is terrible.  I am a size 7.5 in women shoes and these socks  come right off when I put on my boat shoes.  the back (heel of the sock ) is way to small it doesn't even stay on my foot.

i DO NOT RECOMMEND",1
129735,"I love this top, the material feels like good quality and it fights right.  My one complaint is the color, instead of being a u in the front around the neck, it's a lopsided v. It's clearly a sewing error.  I don't care enough to go through the hassle of sending it back, but just a heads up.",4
772736,"Bought 2 sizes bigger then I am. Super super small!! It's a mini dress!! U can see my butt! This is awful! Beautiful but not ment for adults. Was bought for a wedding. Big ladies, and small ladies. All fit the same. For children! Took 2 months to come in!! CHINA! !!",1
666455,I love this scrub top.  It is very well made with details such as grosgrain ribbon on the sleeve and around the neck.  It is bright and colorful and lots of fun.  I have gotten lots of compliments on it.  It is far and away my favorite scrub top.,5
58467,I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he absolutely loved it! I was a little worried when I saw some of the reviews about it being way too smal. Denfinatly take measurements to make sure you get the right size because I thought he'd wear a large and the x-large was the perfect fit. Great quality hat and workmanship. It's very soft and warm! Well worth the money!,5
876156,"I thought the odd-shaped lenses wouldn't bother me, but the thing is...they do look odd when wearing these sunglasses.  Otherwise, everything else is not bad at all.  I'll keep these for use when playing golf on really sunny days.

Pro's: decent price, very lightweight, good for really bright & sunny days.

Con's: odd-shaped lenses leave small gaps with the frame, although being lightweight is nice not sure what this says of the quality of the frame",3
345023,"This tunic is so nice. It's so much higher quality than I expected for the price. Definitely read the size chart, though. I normally wear a US large, and I ordered a XXL & it fits perfectly. It's very long, which I like. On a shorter person (I'm 5'10"") it could almost be a dress. It's perfect to wear with leggings.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",5
466950,"The only flaw, if you want to call it one, I can find with this hat is that it is somewhat large even though it is ""one-size-fits-all"". Thank god my head is not any smaller (I believe my size is around a 7 1/4) because the adjusted strap has no adjustment left on it!",4
434878,"These scratched easily in my bag and the inside of the arms are slowly bubbling up. The actual lenses weren't warped or distorted. They are definitely worth the cost because most sunglasses are cheaply made. Why pay more for the same style?

I plan on buying a couple different styles just because they are inexpensive.",3
315265,"I received the item outside of its plastic packaging, with the metal tip bent. I was unable to replace the pins on my watch due to the bent tip. You have to align the tip perfectly to the slot. I was unable to do so because when I try to twist the knob to push the pin in, the metal tip won't stay aligned with the pin and goes to the side instead.",1
618584,Looks like the print was done in 12th grade shop class! Worst product I have ever bought. I expect a product like this on alibaba or something. Someone else gave this shirt five stars but if you look at his past reviews on products it's written THE EXACT SAME WAY! Buyer beware. Stay away from this garbage.,1
234359,I ordered a size 8 which was too big for my 6 year old daughter but i hemmed it on the sides and the straps and she loved it. Has no poof under the dress. But I took care of that. This was used for a princess party. She received many compliments,5
576305,"My daughter chose this coat for her birthday present. She loved it but it is just too big. She's a size 18 but the 1X wrapped around her like a double breasted coat. It is going back even though there is a 15% restocking fee :(. She did love the style, the warmth, and the material. If it had fit, it would have been just what she was looking for right down to the removable hood!",4
696870,"This item arrived beyond expectations. The item fit very well for a petite 5'2"" 115lb woman with room for potential shrinking upon laundering. Personally my experience Indicates the true testimonials upon ordering 2 at least; larger then your common size. I ordered large despite I am petite. The fabric is shockingly thin thus 1star as well due to awaiting its extended delivery as truly unnerving. My family member said, this blouse  was see-through; and although the case... I opted to wear a camesol under the white light colored garment. Overall I would not buy this item again.",1
471578,"I knew that this shirt wouldn't be tight-fitting - I expected it to be loose, which it was, so it fit my expectations. If you want this shirt to be somewhat time and form-fitting, don't get the regular size you would usually get, get maybe a size smaller. Its great and it comes with a tank top underneath too, which is great.",5
201386,"This is so cute and my boyfriend absolutely loves it on me! I ordered two sizes up but honestly could have gone 3 sizes up because of the waist on the skirt. It still works just fine, just have to wear it up pretty high. It is seen together cheaply though, several of the seams were not sewn properly on the skirt and I had to redo them myself, but overall a decent outfit for the price.",3
653778,"Fit perfectly! This dress is adorable, I get so many compliments when I wear it. I was nervous since it is a Chinese company and I have had issues in the past (issues as in receiving a blouse that looked like it came from Baby Gap) but this dress fit as expected. I'm 5'5"", 120 lbs and I ordered a M. The M is actually slightly loose- I would order a S if I ordered again.",5
381647,"While these pajamas were not a good fit for me, I would not hesitate to recommend them.
 They are nicely made and very soft and cozy.
My only problem was that they were a bit too short in the rise.
I prefer pants to fit at the natural waist.
PajamaMania customer service provided me with the measurements for the next size, but I didn't think that would work. Too bad-I really liked them.",5
418291,I love Lole garments but I didn't keep this one. I loved the colour options but when I tried it on it looked a little boxy for my figure. I have broad shoulders and smaller hips and with the longer sleeve length it just didn't do it for me. I gifted it to a friend who has an athletic build with a bit more curve. It fit better and she said its great for casual travel. Tends to be short but can be worn with leggings. Fits true to size.,3
22660,"The hat has a plastic part on the strap that is a bit of a problem (seems like it may hurt the baby's head) but it didn't seem to bother him. It provided a great deal of coverage and helped him sleep (covered his eyes) while being carried on hikes in a carrier. Our baby looked super cute in it! Wish it was available in larger sizes, we would have purchased the next size up too.",4

I bought it + expidited shipping for cheaper than the concert was selling, plus I got to wear it during the concert 20 or so feet away from In Flames :p. My favorite song is Delight and Angers (Owl Boy album art) and they PLAYED IT.

Anyways back to the shirt. I love the colors, they're so bright and fun and glowed under the concert lights. The shirt is comfy, doesn't stretch too well but I didn't need it to. Overall, best purchase ever.",5
415081,"These came on time and in excellent condition. I'm usually weary of buying clothes online especially if I can't try them on, but I would definitely recommend these. Its great, fits even better than you would think for a T-shirt and its just long enough to cover the pockets which I love. I would definitely buy again from here.",5
668245,"I love the color and the length of these shorts. Its difficult to find shorts this length and this color.

Very happy with this purchase and you will be too!",5
509939,"Great shirt, when I first tried it on I thought it was a little tight around my back but I am plus size person so I deal with this on a normal basis. Have not really wore it out yet so have not washed it yet. Do not know how it will do in washer/dryer.",5
128399,"I purchased this rain jacket to take on a fishing trip to Alaska.  I love the look and fit of the jacket!  I've gotten many compliments on it.  It kept me dry when the rain was coming down.

I would highly recommend it.",5

It is kinda cheap just to hand wash it. That's what I'm going to do.",5

Another plus is the option of light or dark bristles, as I believe a cleaner look results from brushing the corresponding hats separately.",5
82802,"I regret buying this. The material is very thin and looks extremely cheap. Looks like I could have grabbed this in Chinatown for a few bucks, nowhere near worth anything over 20 bucks.

24079,"All things that wrap like this are so convenient with young babies who aren't too excited to have things pulled of their little heads. Our daughter's head also grew pretty big pretty quickly, so she especially liked kimono styles. I think this blue is pretty unisex too, which I liked for our daughter. It's so soft and easy for her to move around in.",5
692829,"(First Review: It's blue, brown, and grey and does not have the design that is shown.)

Edit: The seller e-mailed me and the customer service was fantastic. Although the dress is not what I wanted, the seller really went above and beyond to get this fixed. Increased review due to the customer service.",4
251817,"Guess I should have read the description more carefully.  Since this was described as a beach towel wrap, I expected some kind of cotton terry (towel) fabric.  It is a stretchy lingerie type material.  It will serve the purpose -- to keep me covered on my way to and from the pool -- but not really what I wanted.",3
469251,"I Got this to work out in. I turned out to be a little smaller than I wanted it to be. The material is very stretchy and very comfortable. I decided to use it during my hockey game as an undershirt and it was GREAT! The material is very stretchy so I can take the arms where my wrists are, and wrap them up over my elbow pads almost all the way to my elbow and it holds the pads solid in place.. perfect. I am trying to find more of them!",5
348334,These are perfect. I could not find orange pants anywhere and then I found these. They are lined with that super warm fleece and they are the exact size that I thought they would be. They did arrive in the time frame that they told me they would but my only complaint is that they took forever to get here.,5
1729,"This an awesome hat for the money, it's made with great quality right here in the U.S.A.
The fit is snug but not to tight, ( just follow the sizing chart, wrap a string around your noggin lay it out on the yard stick and thats your size ) so it stays on my head blocking the sun weather I'm  building fence, or flyfishing on the stream.",5
217350,"My husband had me order this hat so he could wear it when he mows the lawn. He liked so much he won t wear it to maw the lawn but when he is outside (we live in the Desert Southwest...it is sunny & scorching hot all year along)
So yes, great looking hat, great quality.",4
659527,"This was a birthday gift for my mother and when it came in the mail I was able to put it in a small little box and give it to her. She loved it, even started to cry. This is a perfect gift for a loved one. Cute and fashionable",5
583919,"I wore these shoes a couple of times and stored them in my shoe bag....when I took them out to wear today the entire heel had deteriorated!  Literally crumbled!  The other shoe seems okay....they were stored in a shoe holder hanging up on my closet door.  All other shoes are just fine.  Is there an explanation as to why the heel would deteriorate? I bought them at a shoe store...same brand, same color.  Size 38.  I could cry!",1
59961,"This was bought as a gift and the receiver loved it. Very comfortable and stylish summer/spring hat. The photo is true to color and overall design.

615491,"Not authentic HD as the product page leads you to believe.  Shirt is not as pictured. I ordered a 2XL, but the shirt I received came from China and resembles that of a woman's med/large shirt with a low neck line to show off the goods. Do not order. Save your money. Would give zero stars if I could!",1
469557,"Beautiful, higher quality than i was expecting. People online SEVERLY overplayed how it fits. I ordered what everyone else in my dimensions apparently ordered and it was FAR too big, so either they were lying about their size, or my measuring tape was wildly wrong. Don't have time to take it back to the post office, so i will in all likelihood reorder 2 sizes smaller than i was expecting, at a later date. Disappointed i can not wear it now. Shipping was alright, nothing to cry about, nothing to dance about.",4
634200,"Exactly as pictured. The zipper looks a little cheap, leather is obliviously fake. But for just a basic daily purse its fine. Comes with a cross body strap and a clutch strap. Very roomy. I like that it has several compartments. Due to how cheap it looks (especially in the light) I tried to return, however the seller charges $6 to return! I guess I am stuck with it.",1
842010,"My daughter loves these because they are my little pony. I bought the largest size, 7, and the pants fit perfectly but the top is a little big. My daughter usually wears a 6. The quality is well made and the colors are vibrant.

I received the product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.",5
198127,I really like the suit.  I got it for my daughter for her 16th birthday and she looks great in it.  I do need to return the top for it is a little large on her. I'll just get a smaller size.  I am going to purchase another suit for my older daughter.,5
686053,"I read the reviews, so I was prepared for the sizing. I really really suggest going up 2 sizes in this outfit. My daughter was well under the sizing guide, but it is still snug on her. It looks so cute and she gets a lot of compliments when wearing it with the leggings and bow, but she won't wear it long due to the size. Just be prepared for the sizing issue.",4
368731,I returned this because it was a little baggy. I am 5'6 and 130 pounds. It fit okay and I thought a medium would be right based on reviews but it wasn't very flattering. A small would have been better. I also wasn't crazy about the overall execution of the material and seams. It was cheap looking and doesn't weigh nearly as much as it appears to. Very light construction.,3
619169,"Outfit was way to small. I ordered a large but it looked like a small. I had to return it. That being said if you are skinny and I do mean, a skinny girl get the dress it was very well made and the fabric felt nice in my hands.",2
141954,"I love this bag.  I ordered two different bags and now I'm struggling with which to keep.  This bag is big enough to fit whatever you need for the day.  It easily fits my macbook air, wallet, kindle, makeup, etc without looking too bulky for everyday use.  My only reservation is that the metal pieces are gold and I usually prefer silver.  I got this on a black friday sale and definitely think it is worth the money.",5
637117,"This shirt is amazing. It is definitely on the heavier side of shirt material (more of a fall shirt than a summer shirt). I'm a 34 B/Cish, 5'6"" ~135lb. I usually wear smalls. This shirt fits perfectly - tight, though not uncomfortably so, and it only lifts up a little when I raise my arms. I don't know if it would fit me comfortably if I were a little bigger.",5
41565,"My son is 8 months, I bought these size 6-12 months. I got them on but BARELY. And they didn't fit right. Also, no stretch around the ankle so they are difficult to get on. I would not recommend. They are cute, but maybe get these for a smaller baby who doesn't move around much.",2
802949,"Great shorts to run around in and yard work. Since they are nylon they dry quickly if they get wet. The pockets could be a little deeper for me, but at least they have pockets that can hold a few things. I've had to buy shorts locally that DON'T HAVE POCKETS! I ordered olive, coral, pink, & navy. Love all of them!",5
572852,"Agree with any other reviewers that these pants run small, so buy a larger size than you think you'll need.  Re: length, I am 5'3"" and the 28.5"" inseam length skims the floor.  I like the boot cut style, although it's a tiny bit more flared than I hoped.  Also liked that the fabric is thick and not flimsy/see-through.  Just wish the waist came up a bit higher... was looking for something with a foldover waist that I could leave unfolded so that I'm not putting everything on display when inverting in yoga class.",4
167578,"These leggings are absolutely perfect! They're lululemon quality for 1/5 of the price. They're very comfy and thick material, which is very flattering and also means they're not see through either! I also bought a full length pair and plan on buying even more in the future. Customer service was great as well.",5
391375,"I wear ties everyday and transition from a regular tie to the more slimmer type for a more modern look. This tie is great for the look. The tie is slim but not a skinny tie. The material is very good and sturdy. It feels great as well. I highly recommend for everyday wear to the business formal, casual, etc.

I received this product for an honest and unbiased review. All opinions are my own.",5
80000,"I got a nice assortment of socks in this package.  No duplicates.  The socks are cute, but the fabric is really thin.  As in, I can see my toes through them.  I don't know how long they will last before developing holes, but since they were essentially only $1/pair, I guess thats what I should expect.  Not bad for the value.",3
846531,"While the lace is very soft, it catches on my poor dry skin. Just handling these drove me crazy because the lace kept snagging on my skin! The fit was perfect and comfortable but I can't handle the snagging. Returned. Tag says Aeropostle brand. While I realize lace by nature is snaggy, these were particularly so.",3
274142,"Very nice belt and I love the buckle! I ordered a wrong color and after a brief conversation they replaced it with a different one.
Belt comes with a strap for keys. It looks like spring there doesn't work so you need to secure it manually. But I didn't even know it comes along so still 5 stars.",5
854547,"I have been looking all over for a skirt like this one. I am very happy with this pencil skirt because it fits my body nicely and smoothly.  I am 5'1"" 107 pounds and it is a couple of inches above my knees.  I bought the extra small.  I am going to buy another one in a different color.",5
678422,"The swim bottom is well made but runs extremely small. My granddaughter ordinarily wears a size 12. Based on other reviews, I ordered this in a size 14 but it is much too small for her. I gave it to her younger sister who is seven years old and it fits her fine. So I'd recommend going up at least two sizes if you order this product.",4
167753,So comfortable! I can wear these as yoga pants AND as leggings with boots. I love these already and have already had two friends purchase a pair as well. I will never buy Victoria Secret yoga pants again. These are sooo much better and you have to love the price!,5
80765,I bought a creepy pug-face t-shirt for my daughter who loves pugs.  She was happy and it weirds out the rest of the family when she wears it because it's so realistic.  What's not to love?  The fit was fine and it's survived a bunch of washings without shrinking or falling apart.,5
457423,"I love these. I was a bit skeptical about moving into locking shoes but I love the power I get now. Makes riding more fun. Learn how to release before you hit the road. My only issue is the bottoms are hard plastic and slide when you walk anywhere, but that is not what they are for.",5
656563,"I love this skirt! I'm 5'2"" 125lbs and purchased a small.

I love how mildly see through it is; it's so sexy wearing out as a day skirt with a black thong. If I wear a nude thong with it you can't see it at all.

Very pleased!

I added two pictures from behind: one with a black thong and another with a nude so you can see the see through-ness.",5
680249,"This is total fake.  I had to get my money back.

The issues with this item are endless:

1.  The shirt was brown, not black
2.  The logo was very dim
3.  The logo was tiny, roughly 4"" x 6"" at most

Don't waste your money!  This seller should be blocked from Amazon.",1
119911,"This was adorable and fit as expected. I highly recommend this kind with the snaps. The ones they sell in most retail stores do not have the snaps and if your baby makes a ""twosie"" it's a huge mess to pull off. Cute and worked like a charm. FYI I bought a non-ruffle ""boy"" pair also because the fit is the same.",5
882231,I weight 115 and 5'4. Normally I wear a XS or Small in bathing suits but I took everyone else's advice and I ordered a size up to a medium. It fit perfect! This is true neoprene fabric and feels so nice. There isn't any riding up your butt or continuous adjusting the top. I may order more in different colors.,5
819703,"Well I knew I was pushing it with the sizing when I bought it, but my main issue was that it is neon, not emerald, and I was hoping for a deep Slytherin green. Its a pretty enough bright green, but it also swishes when you move. And I cannot recommend this to a lady my size, I'm a size12-14, it fits but manages to flatten my butt, and does no similar feat for my stomach. The size range they list are absolute Maximums, any larger and it will compress you to that size, which looks pretty bad on me.",3
528561,I bought this necklace for my 17 year old nephew and he loves it! The pendant with coin has a nice hefty weight to it and the chain is pretty long and is strong enough to hold it. Very stylish and well made piece! I am happy with my purchase.,5
332435,"This veil is good for the price point. I'm still not convinced I got it in ivory, if I did it is very pale in color. The edges are very roughly cut. The lace does not go all the way around. Overall just disappointed. I will be buying a new one to wear on my wedding day.",2
553466,"The fabric is so poor, I can't wear it anywhere. It really looks so cheap and crumpled. The seams are just horrible. And there are threads falling of from every seam and from every single button. I can't give it away either because it is a complete shame. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. DON'T EVER BUY IT.",1
240288,I am so happy with this beautiful ring!  I like it because it is always shiny and never scratches.  The metal is a favorite of mine it is so strong and durable.  I have told my friends about it.  If I need a ring in the future I will be buying it from Metals Jewelry.,5
404344,My boyfriend actually picked this ring out when we were looking at rings.  I secretly bought it for him for Christmas.  I bought it 2 weeks before Christmas and I received it in ample time.  It came in a cute little blue pouch with an expensive-looking box.  We are very satisfied with the ring.  He wears it every day!,5
691098,"It's more like a shirt than a dress. Very short and very thin material. Very cheaply made. The lining of the dress is also very short and way shorter in the back than the front, you can see my underwear easily. I had to buy a slip with lace at the bottom and I'm hoping I can layer it and still wear it, if not I'm not sure what to do.",2
430357,The colors on the ring are off and are not at all the way they are shown in the picture.  The Rose gold is not rose gold at all. It is just a slightly different shade of gold. Does not match any of the rose gold I already have. Gave it to my daughter. Very disappointed.,2
252062,"I got these glasses right in time for a rock n Roll Christmas party. I dressed up Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds with Kaleidoscope eyes, and everyone that tried them on said, ""Oh wow!"" They are great quality and very sturdy. I would highly recommend them for concerts, festivals, and costume dressing. Buy them-you'll have fun with them! They were the hit at our party and made my costume!",3
223958,"I looked for a bag like this for a long time and finally found it, the perfect travel bag -- big enough to carry all my stuff, yet light weight and attractive.  Love it!  Finally Very Bradley figured out that not everyone wants flashy fabric patterns.  This bag is classy and classic, with six roomy inside pockets and two large outside pockets.  The handle length is great too, long enough to carry comfortably on my shoulder.  Top it all off with a zipper the protect your stuff and you're set to go.  Perfect!",5
65896,"I really enjoyed all of my different colors & even found some that I gave away that people also like, however I only have this product 4 stars because when I got one of my tongue rings, one was broken :( I was very sad because it was really pretty :( lol. But anyways this a very good product!",4
139316,"I love to throw this on over a tank top and wear it open in the front.  It dresses up the tank top and is very lightweight. It also helps hide certain body flaws.  I have worn it with other red, white and blue items and it works for patriotic-themed parties.",4
296336,"When I took these boots out of the box, they dazzled me! They're so pretty, they look even better than in the pictures, absolutely gorgeous boots! Perfectly made, very symmetrical needlework and a perfect fit for me. I bought the taupe color and let me tell you, boot dreams come true!",5
403188,My husband bought me one of the violet ones when these were still for sale at Thinkgeek.com and it's been my favorite necklace ever since. I decided I wanted a blue and white one as well so I bought two from here and messaged the seller what colors I wanted. Well they arrived and clearly there have been some upgrades since my first one! The two new ones are incredibly bright and clear and the battery holder/connector seems much sturdier and it's easier to change the batteries. Thinking about getting one of the red ones in the future.,5
766924,"Purchased as birthday gift a couple weeks ago. Went to wrap it up this weekend for Birthday and the watch isn't lighting up. No way to contact seller for refund. Got a different watch for my son (it was sold out at the time I purchased this one) still works after 3 months, better light up, and was cheaper. Extremely disappointed in this product, don't waste your money",1
615558,"These are super cute BUT way small! I usually wear a 6.5 to 7.5 . I ordered a 6.5 first , too small
So I ordered 7.5 and again too small.  They're npt too narrow (although they are a relatively narrow shoe) just too short. My big toe is the only issue.
Maybe they'll stretch.",3
184746,"I love this purse!!!! It has room for the things I put in my purse plus when I get a handgun, I know where to put it. Cool purse and I would recommend it to all women who would protect themselves and their loved ones. It's not just to conceal a gun it's also a fun purse to enjoy!",5
797412,"These sleeveless shirts are fantastic. The designs are very vivid and clean. They fit my 2 year old perfectly, and we've had no problems or issues.  Although I received a discount for my honest review, I'd be happy to recommend them to my family and friends. I will be purchasing more in the future.",5
811434,"Ok, so first off yes, the stitching is comically awful on this dress. BUT, the dress is absolutely beautiful and is such a darling design. It's very full so when the dress is worn you don't really notice the bad stitching that much. The sizing was right on and the color purple of the dress was beautiful. Overall you can't beat this dress for the very low price!",5
739661,"This wig is nothing like the picture.  It's practically white, not silver gray, so don't be fooled into thinking it will look dark gray.  It feels soft and silky and it's comfortable to wear.  It's a lot of hair so it's very poufy.  This does not look anything like a vampire wig.  That's a really funny way to describe this wig now that I have it.  You'd have to be at least 50 to want to wear this wig.",2
831420,"If your using these for your Tragus like it says don't.. they are to short and it's impossible to put the ball back in inside your ear... the top doesn't come off it's the balky that comes off and it's just a big pain, I just left them out, wasn't worth the effort",1
613462,"Well, for the price I wasn't expecting much but I liked the style in the pictures. The fabric is thin but the skirt is cute. I've worn it once and I got compliments. Lots of them. I'm 5'4 120lb (1.64cm 52-55kg) ordered a small and fit perfectly. I wish I have had the option to pay a little bit more for a better quality fabric, but for the 9 something I paid I can't complain.",4
319633,"Wish I had read the other reviews, this is definitely not a Women's size ring. This ring might be perfect for a child and should be advertised as a child's ring. It's really tiny and frail. I feel I wasted 11 dollars on this for sure as it was gift for an adult. In the picture it is shinier, looks better quality, and looks bigger than the product you actually get.",1
382026,"So pretty!! This top definitely runs small...I normally wear a medium to large top, so I ordered a 3x to account for the size difference. It fits nicely...I would compare their 3x size to what most medium sizes fit like. As for the color, it may not be quite as bright as the pictures looks but it is still a very vibrant color. All together I really like the top...would have ordered just one size bigger though for a more loose fit if I had it to do over.",5
627867,"This bag is quite fantastic. As a guy, these feels less like a purse and nore like a doctor bag meets Indiana Jones. The bag always gets compliments and is sturdy. Good size for work and/or a weekender bag. Perfect for a carry on.
I initially wanted to buy this but it sold out.  Bought another bag that was twice as much and not as swanky, but I returned it. Thank God they restocked this item.
Highly recommended",5
403253,"The best value out there for a high quality gold box chain with a good clasp. Perfect for a baby christening. Initially I was worried that the 16"" might be too big, but it fit my 6 month old godson very well. Received in a plastic bag inside a simple cardboard jewelry box. Shipping was very quick too! I definitely recommend this product and this vendor.",5
131,Other reviewers said these shirts were hard to iron. I should have listened. Once you do get them ironed you can be guaranteed that any movement will bring those wrinkles back immediately. I wore the shirt for 2 hours and it looked like I'd slept in it for a week.,2
100994,"One package, yet all different sizes within!

Day two and put on my second my second pair...  Yesterday (day one) no problem and they fit fine, as they were the size I ordered.  Today, I placed on the second pair and they were way too large.  Upon inspection of the label, yesterday was the size I ordered, todays pair label read x-large!

So, three pairs, one package, two different sizes!  How does this happen?",1
260979,"Best underwear I've ever worn. Expensive, but worth it. Wide waist band is comfortable. Good compression that doesn't wear out after multiple washings. Low-rise waistband so you don't flash your undies when you bend over. Fit is somewhat dependent upon body type though. If you have a bubble butt, this will accentuate it. If not, they might be a bit saggy.",5
226177,"I first ordered this skirt Large based on the reviews. It was too big so I ordered a medium and fit just fine. A little loose still. I'm typically a size medium, 6, sometimes 4.
The quality is very good considering the price, but the zipper will need to be handled gently. Nice fabric.",5
158633,"Got a pair of these for myself when my son needed a pair for his ROTC uniform.

The buckles could stand to be slimmer, but being plastic I doubt they'd last as long or cost as little.

I really do like them. they give a clean look, socks stay up and shirts stay tucked.",4
268745,"I bought two of these and both are useless. I had to sew up the white one four times before I could put it on. Then I had to change out of it before I left the house. The black one did the same thing. The fabric is so unstable that the seams all pull apart within minuts. It is sad, because, the embroidery is beautiful. The style is very flattering. To bad they can't be worn.",1
733583,"While I like the sweatshirt it's not what I was expecting after looking at the picture.  It fits more like a sports hoodie than what the picture shows.  I expected a longer more form-fitting style but instead got a traditional hoodie fit which is of course wearable and comfy, just not what I expected.",3
79736,"I put this band on my Luminox watch and didn't care for it at first.  It was stiff and the buckle sits over to the side of the back of the wrist, which felt kind of weird.  After wearing it for a day or two it softened up and stretched out (had to tighten it two spots).  I now like it just as well as the factory rubber band that came on my Luminox and is almost as comfortable but not quite.",4
166872,"I've got three pairs of these and really happy with them. I wear them running and for just hanging around the house. They're snug but not embarrassingly so, stretch in the right ways and don't show unpleasant bulges. They're a little longer than I would expect for capri's, but I'm only 5'2 so for someone taller they'd be mid-calf.

One pair developed a loose thread in the crotch, I contact customer service and was immediately refunded and got a very kind apology. Extremely happy with the product as well as the company!",5
264830,"This wrap is the best.  Very absorbent unlike the other types sold in ""big box"" stores.  I got the bigger size so it goes mid-calf in length and I don't have to worry about being ""over exposed"".  It is somewhat stiff but I am sure it will soften when washed.  I plan to order more.",5
35687,They are very cheap (both in quality and in price).  The plastic that goes behind the ear is rough and really irritating.  the frames are so thin that I can't image they will hold up too long.  But the lenses do the job.  They're good for emergency glasses but I would try a more expensive product hoping they won't be so flimsy,3
632282,"I give it a 1, star Because I can't give it a zero. Case arrived dirty in an old ripped up bag. Looks like a recycled gift with a new ribbon attached. I should have paid more attention to the reviews. Sending it back, not for replacement but, for a refund.",1
83437,this product is being sold as somewhat helpful not in night driving they selling this product which is the same product they are hd for night and hd for day but the glasses are the same which I think it is bad to try put off as different glasses and description is only for daytime driving it does work in the night time I haave purchased both twich and everytime the glasess are the same so I just kept one pair,1
720089,I LOVE THIS DRESS! Only complaint is the shoulder area is a little tight but I knew that from reading reviews before I purchased. Also... I have to wear a slip underneath. This dress is beautiful though and I get so many compliments on it. I am so happy with my purchase!!,4
400524,"I was so happy to find this bracelet! It is delicate enough to wear on my wedding day, and is the perfect piece for my ""something blue"" - good quality and very pretty for a great price. I will wear it after my wedding too since it's my birthstone and will match a lot of other dresses.",5
717775,I love it. I was wearing this while playing payday 2 for fun reaction and my brother freaked out. I responded Im in the middle of a heist in the game and he replied you need Jesus and I laughed. And explained I'm f /ing around. He laughed too. Hard to see through but fun for a prank. Just be careful what the prank is....,4
137433,I love this blazer! It cute and comfortable and though many of the reviews keep saying that the sleeves fit tight that was not true for me. I wear a small and sometimes an xsmall and I ordered a small and it fit perfect. Don't let the reviews deter you from buying this awesome blazer. It's super amazing.,5
807426,"The picture is just a photo shop R.  The actually shirt is a bad iron on i could have just done at home.  The red is so faded on the shirt. This is not worth $20 , i thought i was going to get a good iron on",3
519906,"Just what I was looking for!  I wanted a sheer black scarf to wear in the summer that was not so hot.  This is perfect!  I did pay for faster shipping which costs more than the scarf, and it was delivered a day later than promised, but the price of the scarf was worth it.",5
835615,"I haven't taken this thing off since purchasing months ago. Don't waste your money on more expensive ones. I wear this to the gym, work, in the shower, etc. no scratches or damage whatsoever. Works just as it is supposed to while looking cuter than just a regular hair tie.",5
462421,"I returned these scrub tops. I kept the one I washed , but they are definitely snug around chest, not as large as typical large, and not as large as I expected. The elastic around the back does give it more curves for a more womanly look than most scrubs, and I like that, but just too snug.",2
35749,"I think these will be fine, they are very light and seem a little narrow for the average face...but that is subjective.  Only time will tell if they last very long.  They fit okay, the glass isn't too tiny--I don't like them to be too thin and these are a nice size and shape.",4
3893,"Great well-built costume, can definitely use multiple times. I'm 115 lbs, 5'5'' and the small fits me well (just like the picture, not tight, with some extra room).

I ordered the small hoping that once i shed a few of the extra pounds this would really shape my body... I was disappointed that when i got it, it fit me snuggly on the smallest hook at my current weight. Unfortunately i will not be able to get the results that i wanted but it works well right now as a tummy tuck for wearing underneath cloths.",3
109411,"My husband absolute loves these shirts and asked me to buy more. He usually wears Walmart or Kmart undershirts. Comparing to those brands, this item is thinner, more breathable and let him feel more flexible and comfortable. Sometimes name brands are better than other brands. In this case, it is absolute true.",5
76418,"I have the black one, and I wore it almost every day for a month; finally decided to buy the white one so I could rotate.  I wear my jeans unbuttoned, and no one knows the difference!  It's perfect for the early months when you're not really ready for maternity jeans, but your normal jeans are uncomfortable to sit in at work all day.

I'm normally a 6/8, and I bought the size 2.  I haven't had any issues, and never feel like my pants might not stay up.",5
376069,"It's going back.  I'm too short for this shirt and the sleeves don't allow me good arm movement.  The fabric is quite thin, and I was looking for something more substantial.  In it's favour, it does have discreetly placed pockets. It's just not the shirt for me.",2
18403,"We purchased this hat for our son when he was 2 months old. It came and fit him perfectly after being adjusted. He is now 8 months and it still fits him. I love that you can adjust how big the head is and it will grow with them! It doesn't seem to bother my son either when the back is crumpled under the back of his head He doesn't like the strings being tied, but I think thats just him. We let them hang down and he doesn't mind them.",5
3799,"I just wore this for Halloweeen and loved it! The fringe did start to fall off when I took it out of the package but it held up well throughout the night. I'm 5'8"", 160lbs and the XL fit on the looser side but a looser fit is more appropriate for a flapper costume. The headband was great too!",5
649896,I am a 38DD and bought an XXL since that size normally fits. I couldn't get it zipped over my boobs! They wouldn't even fit in the top area designed for boobs! I think the XXL would fit a C cup and a D if you had a very small frame! I loved the dress itself but the fit is TERRIBLE!,1
796961,"Nice colors, but the dress had in a lot of holes. It seems as if the dress was sitting in some warehouse for a while as quite a lot of holes was in the dress. I can't even take it to be fixed as these holes are all over the dress. Very disappointed.",1
474621,"I was looking for luggage tags to make it easy to find my luggage when traveling at airports.  This tag is pure leather and has an extra long strap to fasten to your bags.  The Bible verse Jeremiah chapter 29 verse 11 says the following:  ""For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the Lord, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end"".  The tag does not have this entire scripture printed on the tag nonetheless, this is still a quality luggage tag.",4
253542,Zipper does not zip back-and-forth very smoothly. The wristlet part broke with in the first six weeks. It is a very cute pattern and design but it is not well-made and very cheap. I guess I got what I paid for. Will not repeat business for this item and do not recommend it. The key pattern is not worth the poor quality,2
15079,"I put these insoles in a cheap pair of walking shoes I purchased about 2 years ago, but are still in great shape. The insoles that came with shoes were thin foam and never provided any support. But, love the new inserts! I am walking comfortably again and, surprise, my knees have been feeling a lot better too. I would recommend these to walkers that are not athletes, but just want to walk without pain.",5

Im a hairstylist and on my feet for 10 hour days so I am all about comfort!
I also received them fast!
So all said, I would definitely recommend them!",5
735241,I bought this bra to have a little variety against other advice I received about underwire while nursing. I have been nursing for 4 months now and tried this bra- and it does not hold my boob well. My nipple is exposed because the cup is too short- which makes a huge mess for a lactating momma. Very disappointed. I am regularly a 34C and I ordered a Medium. It also was a little loose around my rib cage. All around poor fit.,1
404513,"I purchased this item for my niece who is a complete skull/crossbone fanatic. She absolutely loved it! Partuclarly due to the weight of the buckle. She's never seen anything like this before.

I have now printed out every skull/crossbone belt buckle for this site. From now on, my neice wil be receiving them as gifts.

Thnx CoolStuff!!!!",5

796208,"I was not happy my daughter wanted another $100+ back pack. But when she reminded me her old one lasted THREE YEARS, I ordered without hesitation. These are well made, and worth every penny. Plus your kid looks cool...I guess....I dunno. All I know is these backpacks will take a beating. And if you have kids, you know how much homework they get. This is the clown car of backpacks! I cannot believe how many books can be stuffed into this without ripping. Make your daughter happy and buy this.",5
577004,I ordered this dress to be custom made and I was extremely pleased when I received it in the mail. It fits beautifully and hugs in all the right places. If you need a gown for a more upscale event this is definitely the way to go if you have time enough beforehand to order and have it made to fit you specifically.,5
358678,"These stay on great and they are really soft. I love the medium/large size option for my older baby. My 7 month old has eczema and scratches his little face so bad. Newborn mittens are too small and socks (which I resorted to before these) are too rough and irritating. If you have an issue like that with your baby, they are worth every penny. In fact, I would buy the two pack next time. They are well made and cute, so they would also be a great baby gift.",5
857943,"Fits a bit short-wasted and the neckline is not as deep as depicted in the pictures. I'm 5'8, 145 lbs, and usually wear a medium in my tops and 36B in bra size. I ordered an XL per the size chart. I'll still wear it because it fits, just not quite what I was looking for.",3
615407,"This is a girl's 13, not a woman's 13 as advertised.  I found it by searching for a Ladies 13 sandal. Nowhere in the description does it say it's a kids shoe. It's a well made shoe, and luckily I have a friend whose granddaughter wears this size, so I don't have to return it.  If I was buying it for a kid, I'd probably give it a 5 star review.",1

438617,"I am not really sure about the arch support as a four year old cannot really tell you that his arch feels supported well or not, but otherwise he loved them and loved having his own bowling shoes. We had him wear 2 pair of socks first because of the extra width, but he didn't like that and was fine wearing just one pair and having them a little loose.",4
846305,"Wore these to Pilates.  Both instructors said,  ""Oooh, they're so soft,"" and they're right.  Not very thick like yoga stretch pants; not intended for support.  I make sure to line dry.  I don't think they'll hold up well in the dryer.  These would also be great to sleep in.

UPDATE 9/14/16
I have now washed these multiple times and line dried.  Still holding up well.  No seam holes in inappropriate places ...",5
192008,Very nice hat. I don't like the look of new hats so when I came across this one I was pretty excited. It has the look of an older hat that has been worn out in all the write places. The visor part of the hat is nicely curved. The size is adjustable. It's a comfortable hat and I would buy again if I ever lost it. I purchased the pink one and it is exactly as pictured.,5
84826,"There's nothing negative I can say about the bracelet. It's the perfect length.  The clasp is secure but not too hard to open.  And if you are looking to add a little ""something"" to your daily style without looking like a pimp, this is perfect.  My kids are pretty harsh when it comes to what I wear and they all like it.",5
395655,"Probably the coolest shirt I own.
I know it's my only shirt with hidden front buttons.
How cool is that ???
The collar was a tad difficult to button, but a perfect fit.
The body is not too snug, the arms are not too long.
And I'm so glad it fit well because it is so nicely folded; clipped, pinned,
collar protected and crisp, that it would be Hell to have to re-fold it for return.
What a great purchase.",5
268257,"My package just arrived and I LOVE it!  Excellent quality for the price.  The size is perfect, the color is awesome, it is so soft and supple that you will want one in every color!  Thanks for so a wonderful product.  I will definitely buy more and recommend this product!",5
725290,"Does most of what I wanted - the outside slots hold my drivers license, three credit cards, and a twenty dollar bill or two, and I can fit a business card or two in the center pocket - that's about it. It is pretty tight - plastic cards do fine in the slots, but take a little dexterity to pull out. Business cards are a bit tricky to get in or out of the slots or center pocket without bending or tearing. Maybe it will soften up over time.",4
725308,"I get so many compliments on this clutch, and I really like it.  It is a little 'skinnier' than I thought it would be, it accomodates my iPhone quite well but the Galaxy is a tad thicker, so it isn't as good of a fit.  The loop with the strap broke the first day.  That said, the item is fairly inexpensive, and it is unlikely I would carry it using the strap anyway.  I love how many pockets it offers.",4
462885,"I love this wristlet wallet.  I am not a purse carrier, I always forget them somewhere and this is perfect for me.  Holds money, credit cards, phone and there is room for a lip gloss.  I attach my keys to the side and I am ready to go. It is easy to throw in my gym bag or a purse if I chose to use one.",5
569669,"My husband LOVES his new Tilley hat!  It's a LITTLE bit bigger than he'd expected but still fits.  It's completely lined and has a removable interior sweat band for washing.  It's even got a pocket inside for safe keeping items.  According to my husband, he can register this item and it's protected against damage, wear and tear and even LOSS!  Worth the $ for sure.",5
143395,There wasn't anything overly wrong with this skirt but the shape just wasn't very flattering and didn't sit well. Also the fabric felt a little cheap and it wasn't very comfortable. Overall it was okay but I wasn't happy enough with it to keep it. Maybe it would be more flattering on someone taller and thinner. I am short and a have hips so sometimes certain skirts just aren't right for me. Too bad.,3
3622,Actually the costume itself is pretty nice for what it is.  The bust is really big so the top half didn't fit.  I'm a size 14 with a 38D bust and it was loose. The material is scratchy but over all it's a cool costume.  I'm ordering the medium to see if that fits better.  I have a 2 yr old and we are all being super heros for halloween this year.,3
801232,"Love this suit.  It became my go to suit this summer.  Got lots of compliments.  I did have a button pop off almost immediately when I was taking it off, but sewed it back on (couple stitches) and then was just more conscious of the buttons when I took it off after that.  Haven't had another button come off and probably wore it 20+ times this summer.",5
127706,It had a hole in the front of the costume when we received it.  We didn't have time to return it.  My daughter just wore a black tank under it. It just wasn't as nice of quality as I expected....and my expectations where not high.  All the colors on the buttons looked like a little kid colored them.  I really wouldn't have cared if my daughter wasn't so upset over the costume.  For the price it was cheaply made.,2
419208,I lost one of the earring the first time I wore them.  The backings were not tight and I had to keep pushing them back.... until one time I found that the earring was gone!! I liked the earrings but have learned that new backings will also need to be purchased!,2
618897,"This is it  I found the perfect shirt.
I am 5""4  134LB & ordered a size Large
It fits great, I like a lot the feel of this fabric, & how fancy it makes me look.
One other thing I want to say is if your afraid that you will order the wrong size
Don't Be because the fabric has a good stretch to it ,like I said I ordered a Large but even if a ordered a Medium it probably would fit just fine too.
Happy Shopping!!!",5
236165,I bought this pajamas for my Daughter to wear at the hospital and at home. She had it on her list of baby items for her baby shower which was a nice way to get what she wanted and easy for people to pick the right items for her. She loved this set and I got to see her in it and it was beautiful and great quality. The fit was perfect and it shipped out quickly.,5
204093,"I like the graphics, but the shirt is terrible. I wear large in most every style of shirt, due to other reviews I ordered an extra large and still this shirt is too small and the length is also very short, too short. Lastly the graphis were applied crooked and it is very noticeable.",1
180826,"I wear M ordered XL and guess what, I could not close the jacket, to half of my chest, it is a joke ..  I love how it looks like and nice made but the sizing are so wrong  .. it was also so much shorter than in the picture looking like bolero not jacket .. dispointed",1
430480,My favorite pair of  aviators  Yet!! I bought a pair for a costume and for my buddy and we have enjoyed them. They are dark lenses and fit perfect.  Both fast delivery and great packaging I would recommend buying this product from this seller they are great,5

This top is generously sized in width. Shoulders, bust and hips were loose and flowy. The sleeves hit me at my wrist bones and the bottom of the top hit me about mid hip. This top does not cover my fanny. :) I layered this over a turtleneck tunic top that did cover my fanny and I was very pleased with the look.",5
863628,Dress is not as pictured on Amazon. I took a risk buying this for my daughters wedding. The dress is stiff and not flowy as pictured. The crystal beading are bigger on the dress delivered than what is pictured on Amazon. Looks like a costume dress. The bottom of dress looks like a cheap tulle material.,1
365076,It's fits nicely. Gives that little flair at the waist line to hide The belly. It is pretty wrinkles but I am afraid to iron it because it is so delicate. Will try to hang in bathroom while I shower to see if the wrinkles fall out. Other than that it's wonderful.,5
843723,"This shirt is crap! Strings hanging all over the place and it's way too small. I ordered an XL and it would fit a toddler. The color does not look the same as picture. It also took two months to get here. If I could rate a zero, I would!",1
513881,"Dress is very see through, you need a slip under it or you can see your underwear. But for 6 dollars, you can't complain. It's cute. It came early, about 2 weeks. I'm tiny and this fits perfect (5'1, 95 pounds) it seems like an asian size.  I wouldn't get this if you're taller than 5 foot 4 or weigh more than 120 or it might be to short/too small.",4
497379,"This is a NICE t-shirt. As soon as I opened the bag and felt the material, I could tell it was quality.  It's not one of those thin, cheap t-shirts. It's a nice, heavy material.  The fit was good too.  I'm an XL, and this one felt good as soon as I put it on.  It's now in the rotation.",5
154247,"This belly ring is beautiful and very comfortable to wear. My only complaint is that the hole in the top ball is unusually shallow, so you can never really screw it on very well, leading to many checks throughout the day to make sure it hasn't come undone and gotten lost.

Aside from that, this is beautiful, shiny, comfortable, and seems like good quality. Would recommend.",4
781752,"These glasses are great!  It's hard to tell when you order something you haven't seen before but the quality is much better than typical kids sunglasses at a store. And the case is handy and cute too. We have them in both sizes for my kids and they have a very good fit to them. They are lightweight and flexible - my son seems comfortable in them too.

I received the item at a discount in exchange for an honest review.",5
94453,"I was hoping the entire organizer is a semi-stiff material, but the bottom is actually a thin fabric which doesn't hold the shape of the organizer. When I put this into my Longchamp, it just flops around and is totally useless. It might work with a base shaper, but I'd rather try a different organizer.",1
154071,"Just as slim as advertised, the product is of good quality. The rubber strips to keep cards from sliding out on their own offer perfect resistance, not enough to make it difficult to slide with one finger, but enough to beat out gravity. I was worried it would be a little big for my pocket, but fits in every pair of pants, no worries about falling out.",5
142689,"It fit perfectly. It's cozy. Just the right time for this fall weather. I'm glad I got the bigger size. I was almost reluctant to because it seemed so big but I guess there is a difference in their sizes and US sizes. Overall I like it, it's practical and stylish.",4
404162,"I bought these sunglasses because i was looking for a good pair to wear around. i worn them three times already and they some how got a crack down the middle of them. its small enough not to notice but i really liked the sunglasses. I would recommend them for sure they are great sunglasses, i mean im going to continue to wear them until they fall completely apart.",2
788633,"Really love the top.. The top is tight enough around the shoulders to stay put. It's pretty big/flowing so you have to pair it with skinny pants. The only thing I don't like is how high the side slits are- you with have to be comfortable with your belly showing if it's windy or wear high waisted pants. I am a 36 C and usually wear a 10 or 12, but went with the medium and it fits perfectly. Overall super cute top for spring and summer!",5
231681,"I've recently tried several brands of more expensive undewear, looking for something really comfortable (Lacoste, Jack Wills, RLTD, 2(x)ist, etc) and these are by far the most comfortable (Lacoste coming in second - so if you're looking for a cheaper pair try those).

I was worried that the inner mesh for holding my junk would be uncomfortable, but it isn't actually noticeable and it holds my stuff exactly where I want it (not to mention my bulge is much more impressive).  No complaints - I'll be buying more of these!",5
299765,I really like this dress! It looks really nice once you get it on. I like that it is very thin and light. It has a stretchy fabric that clings but also has enough extra room if needed. I went by the chart with the measurements and it fits perfectly.,5
411172,"The first hat I ordered was a medium and it was too small. So I reordered the large size and it fit just right.  Admittedly, I have a large noggin for a woman!  With that said, the hat provides great  coverage from the sun.  Also the strap comes in handy when there is a breeze.  Lastly, it's a good looking hat!",5
454414,"This visor is great for sun protection. It folds to fit in a bag. My hair is naturally curly. So, i really don't like the velcroe in the back. It snags on my hair big time. I usually put a piece of silk under the velcroe. It also runs a bit small. My head is average size but i have to move it in such a way that its adjusted. No major complaints. Its worth a try.",4
150939,"Great colour, the actual dress is exactly as advertised in the picture. If you are petite like me- 5"" about 115 lbs & a a -b bra cup,  I recommend you buy an extra small like a size 2 if you want a skin tight fit.  I ordered a small-4 & its roomy under the arms. I can belt it & it looks fine but for the perfect look I'll have to take it in like 2"" on either side.",4
281992,I returned this bag because the picture makes the finish on the bag look like matte black but in reality it is quite shiny and plastic looking.  It does seem like it would be a useful size with lots of pockets to organize the essentials if you don't mind the plastic look.,2
92570,"This is the most sickening thing I have ever seen.  What on earth is Amazon thinking, carrying this product?  The only reason there is one star marked is because it is the only way to post the review.

Doesn't hug the abs as much but not super loose.  The only odd thing is that it is abnormally tight around the sleeves/armpit.  Not a deal breaker for me as I can adjust to it, but it is the tightest shirt I've owned in that area.  I will buy another.",5
584920,"The shirt itself looks and fits great.  However as another seller stated the graphic appears to be a computer-printed iron on and half of it came off during the first wash so I got to wear it one time.  Unacceptably bad quality which is unfortunate, as I've bought several Fifth Sun products and they were all great except for this one.",1

427287,I own several Newsboy Cabbie hats and have tried on hundreds.  This one does not have the fullness in the front or on the sides as the other hats which was very disappointing.  The color is more pink than peach.  It was made of an interesting linen-like material.  I paid the shipping costs to return the hat.  I will not take a chance ordering from this company again.,2

However, I was looking for a bag that would work well as a carry on also, and this just doesn't cut it.  You can fit nothing but your laptop in the bag (no files, books, chords) and the front pockets are virually useless.  There's no strap so if you don't want to wheel the bag you have to carry it by the two short handles.",2

Completely satisfied!",5

573200,"I love this hoodie! I have the white one and its so pretty. It fits fine, very comfy. I love aeropostale+wear them alot. A little tip I learned bc you know aero sz usually run small and sometimes shrink. I wash my aero clothes and let hang dry, then when completely dry you can fluff in the dryer on low heat with fabric softener sheet. That's the best way I found not to shrink your clothes, and it works for me. Great hoodie, love it!",5
544705,"I needed a dark fairy costume for Halloween that wouldn't break my bank. I found this one and fell in love! BUT when it finally arrived it was so itchy and uncomfortable I didn't want to wear it for the whole night! It also had some quality issues, the tutu fell aparty so I left little bits of me everywhere I went. But considering the price I wasn't that surprised.",3
9938,I ordered these as a gift because I draw on them and then apply a rain sealant. The recipient seemed pleased with the shoes and she wears them often. I perosnally know Vans to be a great shoe company. They run true to size and have lasted me for years.,4
666241,"We initially ordered the XL, as so many items run small, but it was way too big! Returned, and ordered the M, and it fit perfectly. (My wife is 38D-28-38). She loves the fit and feel... The top does present a ""fallout problem"", so have to be a bit careful :) It is somewhat adjustable to ensure a proper fit. Definitely a sexy look for photos, She did swim with it, but soon chose to wear the bottoms with a while tank top for swimming - sexy combo :)",5
325122,"This is a great alternative to a bulky wallet. I would keep all my cards, ID etc. loose and stuffed in the middle of my folded cash. This wallet is a great organizer and it actually slims out the bulk in my front pocket. The wallet is only slightly larger than cas folded in half.",5
21065,"I really love the design and use of this hat; however, it runs a bit small so get the biggest one you can. I have the largest size and truthfully it's almost too small for my 2 year 10 month old son. So I wouldn't purchase for over 3 years. Definitely a great hat though for shading the sun and protecting your little one.",4
673993,"I love my new wallet. I'm a female who had a huge thing for a while. Things would get lost in there. I always needed to carry a bag to hold the wallet. I live in a commuter city and sometimes I just want to go in to my pocket for things vs dig through my bag.
This wallet is simple , looks way more expensive than it is. The quality of the leather is thick and will last. Im looking forward to watching how it age as great quality leather does.",5
56379,"My favorite hat. This hat is extremely comfortable. It fit perfectly and keeps my neck and face warm. For me, it is too hot for anything warmer than 25 *F. I live in north eastern Ohio, so I get to wear it fairly often in the winter. The leather is a great wind break.",5
43047,"I should have known better than to buy reading glasses on line. But the price just seemed unbelievable. It was, everyone of them broke, some while on my face just busted in half. Don't waste your money. One good pair for 11.99 is better than six that break if you touch them",1
734299,"The photo is highly deceptive  It depicts a full size cardigan down to the middle calf.  The actual size came reaching only at the hip.  The hood and cowl looks full as well.  The hood barely fit on top of the head.  Although this looks like lingerie, It was to be used as an adult costume paired with a Santa for an event.  It was cheap looking and poorly made.  Horrible!!",1
240406,"Opted for this ring thinking i'd probably lose it at some point and would rather replace this than a $1k one. But after 2 weeks with it doing barbell workouts and just generally being rough, it is still super shiny and mirror reflective like the first day. Very comfortable as well with the smooth outside and inside. 6MM width is just right for a medium size guy without being too chunky",5
696732,"I loved this coat but, it was way too small and I ordered an xtra large, I went exactly by the sizing chart too, it's the size of a Juniors xtra large, it's too bad too because the coat is made with great thick material. I had to return it unfortunately because, they didn't have a larger size, kind of bummed about that and they were really helpful about the return,  I appreciated that the most!!!",5
880629,"Just got the t-shirt today & tried it on. I'm between an XL & an XXL. It is advertised as a ""slim fit."" I ordered 2XL & it fits like a glove. Though it says it is preshrunk, perhaps that's why it's slim fit, I think I'll air dry it the first few times. Unfortunately, I am far from preshrunk myself.
Great graphics. Timely delivery. No worries.",4
524164,"I just love love love this bag.  Never worrie again about water or soft drinks in or on my bag!  And it is just the right size.  Lining is plastic coated fabric,  really nice.  If this is the type of bag you want, I suggest this one.",5
669140,"Really unhappy with this shirt. The actual product does not look like the photo.  The shirt is very thin, not fitted, short in length and is a random generic brand.  More of an adult ladies cut than a teen girls cut which is usually narrow cut and longer for layering.  The image on the shirt is also super dim / faded, not vibrant like the photo.  I contacted the seller to discuss a return and received no response.  Really disappointed considering how expensive the shirt was.  Recommend buying the shirt through Hot Topic instead.",1
737977,"not exactly large but more so just didn't fit the way it does in the picture but it's probably photoshopped anyway. the front looks perfect and adorable. the back doesn't cling to your body like it shows, it is loose and looks very awkward. I think i can sew it and fix it but idk. haven't worn it yet bc the back just ruins it imo",3
435595,"Pros: It has real pockets that fit a phone and the stitching isn't falling apart like other clothes you might find online.
Cons: I wear a S or M normally, so I followed the size chart and ordered a L. It's very tight, it feels like it's made to scrunch up as much as possible. The sleeves are a little long but if you're tall then they might fit you well. I hate the material, it's itchy and hot and this thing is a lint magnet. If you're looking for something soft and comfortable--this cardigan isn't for you.",1
242848,Ring is very comfortable with simple but elegant appearance.  Arrived in a small plastic bag inside a black felt bag that was inside a larger plastic bag.  Good thing the ring was a hard tungsten -- shipping package had been run over displaying black tread marks on the outside and was two days late to boot.,5
378120,BARS ARE TOO LONG. My old tongue ring was 1 inch from ball end to end (pictured here). There's no way I could wear these. You should only have bars like these right after you have your tongue pierced to accomodate swelling. I do have to say the balls are very cute though. Really disappointed that I can't wear these without buying new bars.,2
666311,"I'm very impressed with the product. It's very good quality for a very reasonable price, at this price I'll be back! Better than any Victoria Secret  bikin I've owned.  So happy I purchased this item. I'm a 38DD (natural)  5'2"" curvy figure. Fits perfectly and holds everything in place. It's a vibrant bright blue ""Ibiza blue"", difficult to describe but more blue than greenish as the the photo shows more of a bright teal-ish blue. Very pretty color. Fully lined. Impressed item and with presentation.",5
409480,"I did not like this product at all, was very disappointed with it, and I returned it back to the company.

I will just have to keep looking for something better that is not expensive for this winter season for my boots.

I don't have much of a recommendation for anyone else to try it.",1
168613,"I ordered and chose standard shipping, I was  annoyed I couldn't get them overnight, due to my impatience. So, I was so excited to see they came a day earlier than expected! So far they look awesome, and seem to be made decently not cheaply. The colors are awesome and I don't see any repeats in the 100 lot. A ton of variety. I can't wait to wear them.

UPDATE!! : THERE IS 101 OF THEM NO REPEATS (SAME COLOR, SAME STYLE) BUT THERE ARE ONES THAT ARE VERY CLOSE ON COLOR AND STYLE. GREAT PURCHASE!",5
748335,"I still like this dress, though it tends to fall off the shoulder. Very soft light rayon, a warmer tan, less pink underskirt would improve this dress visually, but generally soft easy and flattering, I wear a soft golden very long scarf to correct the large head shoulder neckline opening. I basically enjoy wearing this dress, I love the light fabric and the green is a perfect olive, buy, it you will enjoy the dress.",5
518811,"Ok this is expensive, but well worth the investment.

With traditional mittens and booties/socks.. they fly off pretty fast if you have an active infant.
Prior to these, I would have to put socks and mittens back on multiple times a day. These stay put and do not come off until you want it to.

As parents, we are already busy enough.. anything that makes life easier is worth the money.",5
84786,"Looks good, the closure works really well, but after a month the leather has already started to break down and crack, so it won't last much longer.  I bought it to replace a similar bracelet I lost, that I bought off ebay from China.  I had that one a year, with no problems.

I liked this one more, but unfortunately it isn't very well made.",2
682692,My Son loves this shirt. He wants to wear it all the time we have had it sense Christmas and it has stood up to lots of washing which is nice. We felt this fit a bit large. He will have room to grow into it. I think it would be nice to have toddler sizes too.,4
758141,This dress runs very small. I bought an XL and I couldn't even it get it on.. I wear US size 8. The material is so thin as well. Since it was really cheap I gave it to my friend's daughter and it fit her well. This dress is kids/teen size.,1
828617,"It was 5, bt I switch to 4. The glasses are very polarized so these are perfect SUN glasses. However, in the Even that you get any tiny little scratch on the lens or brush it on something my accident, it never goes away. It doesn't effect the inside lens...just the overall look on the outside. KEEP THEM IN A CASE AT ALL TIMES!",5
18994,"This product came in and looked as though it had been dropped and trampled on. It was also the wrong size, but I tried it on my daughter  and it fit, so I decided to keep it and try washing it figuring the stains would come out. They did not. I should have sent this product back but we were leaving to go out of townand needed it.",1
369608,"Love this suit!!!! I wear a size 14/16, and am a 38DDD- don't have time to miss around with ill fitting and non supportive bathing suits- this top is amazing! No slipping out :) I ordered the XXL based on what I read in other reviews and it fits perfectly :)",5
417433,I was a little hesitant to get these for the look I was going for in a photoshoot but when I tried them on after getting them. I fell in love! You can remold them into the shape of wing span you want and yes even though they are a little top heavy they are still great wings!,5
620201,"Aside from a thinner fabric being used since the last time I made a purchase, this is a great product.  In the past they were used to provide cover up when a top was too low.  Currently I have shingles and cannot wear a bra so I use Halftees instead!",5
491864,"You never know exactly what to expect when buying from a jewelry source for the first time. Rest assured, this was a great purchase. These earrings are exquisite! They have a lot of life and sparkle and they are very comfortable. It would be easy to believe that they cost double the price offered here.",5
517550,"I've been coming to Gildan for years regarding my choice of sweats, so when I needed a pair for a costume I was of course going to come to them. Their pants are warm, comfortable, and durable. If you're looking for a pair of sweats to be your go-to pair, these guys have it for you!",5
117196,"I really loved this sleeper gown. I bought it with the hope it would still fit my small 2 year old for a hospital stay we had, but it is more to the 18m in size and I couldn't zip it up. Super soft and well made, with a beautiful design. I decided to give it as a gift instead.",5
868336,"Dress is beautiful!!! I had to return because like reviews stated it did run small, usually i wear 4/6, so I went with a 6. But before I returned I did buy another one 2 sizes bigger per the suggestions. I'm really excited to get the new one and see what it's like fully on! Also returns and refund was easy and quick to be issued! Shipping was fast and no hassles! I would definitely recommend buying this dress :) :)",5
66367,"excellent buy, I am more than satisfied with these, I think I got maybe 2 doubles which isn't bad for 100, I think there was only 2 designs I wasn't crazy about.. So many cool designs skulls,peace signs, weed leaves, rasta colors, stars, smileys, and so much more, I will never wear them all in my life time so I gave 10 to my friend Harlee and she was happy as well",5
748506,"Bought this gorgeous and retro dress to wear as a guest to a wedding and I was so excited when it arrived. It is so comfy. The fabric is heavy but breathable and the shape of this is so flattering. I did need to wear an undershirt because I have a large bust but I think a lot of people could get away with pinning it if it's too low cut for their tastes. I pretty much want to live in this comfy, gorgeous dress.",5
101352,This product was one of the worst purchases I've ever made. I threw them out. The size was a disaster. Big some places too small others. The pants also came complete with two different holes; one on the ankle and one on the waist and strings were hanging from the seams. Awful!!!,1
507462,"I received the watch. After pulling the tab off for the battery then analog portion was inop. I emailed the supplier several times and they asked me to verify that the watch was inop by taking a video. I did.. attached and the email service did not let the attachment through I tried 3 more times brining the attachment down to less than 1 mg, it did not work. The supplier has not responded since. Do not use this supplier",1
376025,I absolutely loved this bag! Bought it to take on a weeks vacation and it held up great I still use it to go swimming at friends & my step dads house it holds four beach towels (possibly more all I needed was 4)  swimming suits and other things! It's big an spacious definitely a MUST HAVE! And it's well put together and don't have to worry about it ripping!,5
164041,"These are amazing! They're big which was exactly what I was looking for, and so cute. My only complaint is I ordered a gold pair and a silver pair and the difference isn't as dramatic as I would like. I expected the gold ones to be a bright gold, but in person they're more dull and I couldn't tell which was which until I looked at the packaging",4
45811,"Loved this costume! It was easy and a perfect fit! I am also VERY TALL, 6'1 to be exact. This fit like a glove and had the perfect height for all you long legged Bettys! If you are out of costume ideas or a last minute costume condiseur his is for you!",5
319985,"They are slightly smaller than the actually size but they are lightweight and easy to sleep in. They come out beautifully in photos. Easy to clean and sanitize. The picture makes the white look pink but the color is similar to the daylight version of plain glow in the dark green. For the quality and price, it's a great buy!",5
45908,"This is PERFECT! I am 5'4"" with a booty and C boobies - a small fits perfect!! It's tight and scared me a little at first when I had to slide it over my butt but honestly once it's zipped it fits like a glove. I'd rather have it be tight and hold everything in! Shipping was so fast. It's the perfect length for my 5'4"" body... It IS a tiny bit see through in the booty due to my curves but I will be wearing volleyball spandex shorts, problem solved :)",5
511890,"The quality of this product was garbage at best. Cheap, thin material and there were threads hanging everywhere. Some seems we're sewn in a white thread that were thicker than the dress material and they were showing. Ugly.  I would never recommend this item to anyone ever! Nothing sexy about it!",1
405007,"My friend loves her baby's chenile socks, and wanted some in the 6-12 mo range, but they are IMPOSSIBLE to find.  I looked EVERYWHERE, no luck.  But Bamboo is just as soft, and a whole lot sturdier, so I gave these a shot!  She loves them, the baby loves them, and they feel just as soft as the chenile socks. But she can grip better when walking, the socks can be WASHED in the machine, and they're warm!  I'd say that makes them infinitely better than chenile!",5
570950,If you are looking for a tight fitting cool looking hoodie this is for you. But if you want it to be comfortable and it to not feel like a cheap holloween costume piece that is about to rip at the stitches every time you put it on then don't buy this hoodie. If you were hoping for a quality cotton sweatpants type material then do not purchase this.,2
726478,"Unfortunately the inside part that holds the phone fell out and makes this useless. Lasted just over a month before this happened and the worst part is when the inside part detached my daughters phone fell out cracking the screen. The case itself is nice and my daughter loved the Marauder Map, but as a useful phone case I cannot recommend this item.",1
800045,These are theeee best leggings ever. I have two pair and I wear them at least 3 times/week. They are thick and warm and the compression top really helped shape and smooth my postpartum tummy. Confession: my daughter is 18 months old and I am about to order more. I love these! After wearing them 3x/week for 18m they finally got a little snag and a hole. Thats not bad for all the wear I have given them. Buy these!,5
682085,This jacket is everything. Not too big not too small. I love it however I did order a size up due to other reviews and you guys were right its cut small so def order up a size. Overall great jacket. I'm usually a size XL but I ordered 2X and it works!,5
463992,I normally wear a small in normal American clothes so I thought a large in this would be big enough to fit me. I was definitely wrong. The sleeves are way to short and the material is cheap  and thin and smells weird. I also don't think the coat I received is the same as the one pictured because it has no pockets.  I don't even want to bother returning it because I would probably pay almost the price of it just to ship it back.,1
575347,"Works great. The one negative, not worth dropping a star for, is that the buckle clamps on the belt and can come off if pulled hard enough. It's only happened a couple of times and never while wearing it. It's also quick and easy to fix: just place it and clip. Buying another one now.",5

767716,"This was a gift. The burgundy and red colors are true to what's shown online. But the material is thicker than I expected. The 30% wool is more predominant than I wanted. But if you want something to keep you warmer than just for show, then the reversible wrap will work for you. The recipient did appreciate the gift.",3
130930,"It fits as expected and is super comfortable. The material breathes very nicely.
It can be a little low cut as it shows in the picture, but if you are in a modest setting, just wear a light under shirt and it looks fine. no one would ever know.  I am so glad I got this. Totally worth it.",4
407015,"After looking forever to find a bag that WASN'T a laptop bag I stumbled upon this. The reviews basically described it for what it is - a nice bag that CAN hold a laptop but is really made for paperwork, a book, and sundries.
Is it perfect? For me the answer is yes. It works perfectly for what I need it for. Will it be for others? Maybe not, but if you're looking for a no-nonsense bag for short trips or to carry to work this is it.",5
638672,"Good fit and nice design, but  only one of the two shirts in this two-pack purchase was satisfactory.  The other one is poorly made: bad stitching on the hems--around arm hole (visible from the start) and on the bottom edge of shirt.  The bottom hem started to come apart at first washing. To be fair, I haven't tried to contact company for rectification-- too much trouble for a 3 dollar shirt.  And if the shirt continues to degrade, I'll just use it as a rag...a somewhat pricey rag, definitely, but not useless for that reason.",1

I was looking for something a lil longer than the on screen hot pants for my cosplay and these fit beautifully. I ordered a few sizes up,I'm 5'8"" and usually an M-L so i got an XL. Can't wait to wear these for my cosplay, thank you!!!",4
881712,This is a beautiful but very spandex like shirt.  I would recommend this if you have a skinny body with large boobs.  This is very sexy and will show off every single curve you have.  Unfortunately I am B/C cup and a size 8 so it was too big around the chest area.  I followed the size chart and ordered an extra large but I probably should have ordered a large instead.,4

Get one for free from the hospital.

I had a c-section and got a ""hospital grade"" one that is more stretchy but gives great support. I would ask for two sizes, one bigger one for when you're still there and a smaller one when your stomach gets smaller.

Don't waste $50 - buy some educational toys or books instead",2

So buyer beware.",1

I love what I think it represents, My heart is in a bottle to keep it from getting broken. I think people of all ages would enjoy wearing this. Its shiny and bright. It actually goes with anything you might want to wear it with. I am considering getting these for christmas presents this year. I purchased this through amazon review trader at a discount but would definitely pay full price for it.",5
705099,"I wear small normally, but bought a size up based on the previous reviews.  It fits just how I like it, not too tight and not baggy.  It's very warm, too.  I'll probably be purchasing a bunch more of these to wear under my scrubs at work.",5
443699,Wonderful Coach purse.  Has lots of space and I especially like the fact that there is a zipper in front for keys and cell phone while on the go.  My only concern with this product is the white flower which is pinned to the purse.  This is a stylish add-on but it is not always securely attached.  After carrying this purse for a week I had noticed scratches on my arm of which I carried the purse and realized that the pin had been cutting me... Be aware of this!!!,4
436226,"These are pricey, but they're the best leggings Ive found. Medium weight (unlike most maternity leggings that have been paper thin), super soft, true to size and long enough for tall ladies (yay!).  I was 510, 138# and size 4/6 or jean 28 pre baby, I got a medium in these. Initially bought the black and came back for the grey as well. If they were slightly more affordable Id get the blue as well.",4

I usually carry in excess of 15 CCs and 10 business cards.  OK I overload, but it worked out for me.  Even my son-in-law loved it.  Got one for him too.",5
429206,"I bought these earrings to go with a matching necklace for my teenage granddaughter at Christmas.  She was delighted. The amethysts are a deep, rich color, as are the topaz center stones; and the diamond chips were just a little bonus for fancy. As an added benefit, the cost was about one third of a local dept store's. Call me well-pleased. :)",5
816469,"I love these t-shirts!  They are very form fitting and feminine, the perfect length for tucking in without bunching up, and seem to be very well made.  Thick enough to be completely opaque yet not heavy.  I've worn and washed them several times and have seen no shrinkage or loose threads.",5
757565,"It was extremely small, Everything in my closet is a size small so I bought this shirt in a size small and it will fit my 8 year old daughter if that tells you how small it was and not to mention very, very cheap. If I was to see this shirt in person in the mall I would of never purchased this shirt. Very Upset customer. I wound up throwing it in the trash. This shirt was not even worthy of 1 STAR, Amazon made me add the one star or I could not submit how I felt.",1
573444,I purchased this gown because I was running for Queen of the Desert Riders Ball.  I looked like a princess.  I got great comments on how beautiful I looked. Well I won.  I am now Queen of the Ball.  I love this gown.  It fit perfectly.,5
858118,"The dress is nice! Light, flowy, and very comfortable! The colors are a little less red and a little more fuschia but still very pretty.

My other thing was that I can't believe this tiny thing is in the plus size?? I'm 5 foot 5 and 158 lbs and I had to get a 4X. The 4X was big enough for me. The dress seems to be made more for BUST than for waist.... But the back of the dress has a tie so that's nice.

But seriously I love this dress and I'm SO EXCITED to wear it out!",4
858563,"Honestly I would give this thing 5 stars because it's really cute and it fits nice and seems like it's good quality, but it arrived totally damaged so I can't use it. Now I have to try to return it which is a huge bummer since we're going to the beach tomorrow!",2
492588,"Ordered XL. Fit closer to a Medium than an XL. Extremely short. Came in an 8 X 10 envelope that felt virtually empty. Almost paper thin material. Nothing AT ALL like the photo. Really was laughable.  Extremely fast shipping if there was a positive aspect, but fast shipping of such a disappointing product is of no value.",1
845065,"The dress is as pictured. The silver detail is sequins not rhinestones, just FYI. It bunches in an odd place right around my hip area but other than that. It's a nice dress. Heavy/ Good quality fabric. Made VERY well. I did want a zipper in the back instead of corset back. I eMailed and requested that but I think the seller forgot. Still beautiful.",4

I'm absolutely thrilled at how fast the product arrived and I received exactly what I expected.  I will definately tell my friends about my experience with Sabrina Silver and won't hesitate to order from them again in the future.  I only wish I would have found them sooner, I wasted a lot of time checking at local stores trying to find these bracelets.",5
76568,"I was wanting a 100% wool cap but cannot find one. I saw this on sale and purchased it. I have a Pendalton that I have had for about 25 years but they no longer make caps.

For a blend it is nice and the cut is about right. I am sure mine was a large but will try and order an XL and see if the fit is better. I will give this one away as I cannot return it after cutting the tags and wearing it for a couple days to see if I liked it.",4
551694,"I referenced the size chart provided and bought the corresponding size related to my bra size.  This item was significantly too small.  I am a 38DD, and I ordered a Large.  Go one size bigger.  Return was effortless, however.  Happy with how that was handled.",1
722650,"Looks cute but deceiving. It is from an overseas company so the size chart is not our size chart runs very small. The buckles didn't come attached. You have to put all 4 on your self. Also, the button holes are not opened they were sewn shut! I had to cut the button holes open to avoid the shipping them back headache. When I received them finally, I felt like I was working in the factory to make them. I wound up giving them to my 16 year old daughter and it fit but snug smh",2

I was fortunate to have seen him a few times live. I bought a few T-shirts as a souvenir. They are beautiful. Thank you Amazon and the seller for facilitating this purchase.",5
412286,Fabric is fantastic and looks great. The buttons as someone else stated are barely sewn on which is a bit of a turn-off. The fit is nowhere near as expected. I'm a 6' 165lb male and the medium fits like an XL. Since there is no small size avaliable I will be returning this one and I guess trying an X-small since that is the only size available. Will update review once exchange is made.,3
420979,"I had looked at buying this costume for two years, was afraid to because of the weight.  Package got here very fast.  Costume is smartly created.  The Russian emblem is pinned on so you can remove it.  The muff has a hidden zipper pouch for money and ID and a string strap to make it like a purse.  Outfit does not embarrass me, very good quality.  It will be part of my icequeen costume for Santacon, very excited.",5
459909,"I have a few Terry cloth rompers, and I love them.  I cant say the same for this one.  It feels like a really, really thick towel.  I also bought a medium being unfamiliar with the brand and it just barely fits,  I usually wear a small.  If I were to gain a few pounds it would be to small.  I do like the print of the romper its very summer like.  I would definitely go up a size or maybe 2 because it runs small.",2
492612,"These tights fit me fine. I am 4'10"" and 92 pounds. They seem to be of fine quality however they are not fleece. They are nothing more than regular tights. They are solid and not see through. I do not see these as being warm. They are no different than any pair of regular tights you could purchase anywhere. These can not be worn with a long sweater or tunic or a short dress, they are much too thin.",3
516144,"Wearing this reminds me of my kitties, Mambo and Taco. I love it! I had my eye on this necklace for months and finally went for it and ordered it. The materials are very sturdy and looks like the piece and the chain is going to last for many years so my granddaughter can wear it too after I'm gone.",5
528327,"This dress is not as structured as I was thinking/hoping it would be. It is not see-through, which is a good thing. I'm 6'0 and it hits me right about at the knees. This is definitely not a dress I would wear under a blazer at work. It's more of a date- night- I might not be in this dress very long - kind of dress.

It is super cute, I'll give it that, but it does not leave much room for guessing. Definitely order a size up. I am a curvy size 12, the Large was a big tight.",3
579101,"i am very happy that I read the reviews and ordered in my item in large. i usually wear medium. I am a size 8 140 lbs. and the large would be great if you are size 8, in fact if i lost a little weight i will probably love this tunic even better. I would say this item runs small. I would go up at least 1 size.",4
701888,"This dress is WAY too small - it is loose in the bust and waist, but the skirt is so short, it looks ridiculous. NOTHING like the photo, which would imply that it is a normal, vintage style dress that should go to the knees (at least). I'm 5'2"" and this dress is mid-thigh on me. Do not waste your money - this dress went right in the trash and I will not be purchasing from this seller again.",1
827929,Very cute but too small for me. Seller took care of the problem and was very nice about it.  My friend ordered one and hers was also smaller than expected.  Just be sure to order 2 sizes above your normal size and you'll be very happy with it!,3
274208,"My husband cannot do without these belts.  He is mature and the size of his waist changes sometimes but with the ability to adjust the belts to fit his particular waist size at the time is wonderful.  The belts are very well made and you can get different styles and colors which I like.  Black, bronze, silver and more.",5
357869,"I got this for my brother and he really liked it. I think it is a really nice looking watch, but a little big. However, he said he has gotten a lot of compliments. The watch does have a large face. Also, be prepared to get some links removed. The length of the band is pretty long. I believe I had to remove four links. They have a tutorial on the Lux woods website on how to remove links but you will need some tools specially made for removing links.",5
128794,"Absolutely love this jacket! Though the review said to go one size larger, after seeing it on and seeing the fit on me, I personally would've maybe stuck with my original size. Though it is a bit big on me, it is adjustable so that I can still make it work. I wore it for the first time the other day during a rain storm and had no problems. I would highly recommend.",5
487742,"I was extreamly disappointed with my purchase. The dress you actually end up getting looks nothing like the picture. The red in the dress is more of a fire truck red. The lace, which looks like an off white, is a bright white. And it ends halfway around the dress, so from the back and side you can see that the lace ends underneath the armpits. The fabric is cheep, not what you'd expect from the picture and rips easily. I gave this product three stars because the seller was very understanding, and we worked out a refund.",3
772848,"I ordered this for my 50 pound 8 year old to wear at Jampcon. I order it 1 size bigger than what he would normally wear so 1. It would last longer and 2. He could wear clothes underneath. I have to say it is perfect! The material is super soft and warm. This outfit is also very durable! He wore it for 3 days at the con. Jumping, running, skidding across floors and everything else a hyper 8 year old can think to do and it is still in one piece!",5
79391,"I was disappointed with the fake nose ring because it doesn't sit flush against (or close to) your skin. Even though the magnet is small, it still causes the stud to stick out away from your nose or lip area making it look very fake and awkward. However, it looks very cute and natural on the cartilage part of your ear. The magnet is extremely strong and the ring doesn't shift around... I've even slept in mine.",2
344777,I could get them on. They were perfect for my costume. I'm a size 8 and ordered the large. I still could have used some wiggle room. These things are not built for anyone with a butt. They also don't breath. I thought I might use them later for circus arts classes but the shimmer on them is costume quality. One and done kinda thing.,3
228142,"I am 5'2"", 120 lbs, 34B, Size 4 pants and this costume fit very well for me! The skirt is just a little loose when worn high waisted, but that's just if you have a smaller waist. The shirt is thin and a bit see-through, so you probably should wear a nude bra underneath. The shirt is made of a thicker fabric and will show your butt cheeks lol. It came with black striped knee high socks as well! Over it was a really good purchase, and it was delivered fast! Would recommend!",5
375379,"Super cute. Just as pictured. I'm 5-6' and 160lbs. I ordered the XL just to be cautious with the Asian sizes. I could have gotten the L..there's elastic around the waist, so it gives the dress some slack.. but either way, the belt that comes with it works as a perfect cintcher..",5
406565,I found these swim trunks/shorts on line in my search for the increasingly hard to find mens shorts with a shorter  inseam. I had purchased several pairs of the original shorts which were more heavy duty in construction and feel. This newer version with the same fit is much more comfortable made of lighter and softer materials. They are better than the similar Speedo shorts and cost less. These shorts are the most improved product I have found anywhere.,5
158567,"Best Buy! Initially when i purchased i thought they were a little pricey compared to similar items; but they are worth every penny. Solid build, great clips, never slip, easy and convenient use. Dont waste time and money buying anything else. i tried them all and they do not work.  Some are too difficult to get on, they pop off at the worst times, rip and wrinkle your shirts. THESE ONES ARE THE ANSWER TO ALL THOSE PROBLEMS. SPEND THE LITTLE EXTRA AND YOU WONT REGRET IT.",5
286080,I bought this passport wallet for our daughter. She just got her passport renewed and she is going to the Bahamas next month. I thought this would make a great gift and it did. She really loves it. It's soft leather and has six pockets for carrying other important cards and things she might need. With this wallet she can keep them all in one safe place. It's pretty too. I got the tan color. This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review and my opinions are my own.,5
777677,"Omg my bf looooved it. He is a die had man u fan and i swear he almost died when i got him this. Material is good, very stretchy so he can move around comfortably, how ever  after just the first wash it faded a bit and a bit shorter Than i expected but hey its a boxers so it goes under his clothes. Or not when hes home hahaha  . Very unique . Love it. From his awesome gf.",4
836200,This is a well made blouse but it does run VERY small.  I am 36D usually a size medium and I ordered an extra large.  The buttons don't pull with the larger size however the blouse is not that long.  It is shorter in the front than in the back so I don't really think this picture is a fair depiction as there is no way you can tuck this in as shown in the picture.,3
623151,I purchased this for a person that usually wears an 2X but chose to purchase a 3X because the only options that were available were XL and 3X. It fit perfectly! 4 stars because the fit was slightly smaller than expected. If I were purchasing this for a person that was actually a 3X it would of been too small.,4
94166,Not happy about this at all. It was too small and I am a 4 or 6.  All of the reviews where saying how big the costume was so I order small.  It is also poorly made.  I couldn't return it... it was too much of a hassle and I was not going to get all my money back.  I learned my lesson about buying cloth on Amazon from vendors who are not Prime.,1
70551,"I received the band in relatively quickly. The quality is good and the advantage is that, beacuse it is a ""wrap around"" band, you can ensure you get a tailored fit. The serenity prayer has a powerful message and I am happy to have something I can wear which helps to remind me to apply its meaning on a regular basis...",4
571466,"This shirt is much smaller than the other one that I have that is the same exact maker and same exact size.  This tells me that size/quality control is poor.  Unfortunately, this shirt is too small to wear.  Luckily, the other fits perfectly (with room to spare).  Unusual.",2

it's been many months dealing with this issue.
finally, something that really helps...
Going to order a 2nd pair as back up, these shoes are the best.  (I am not a runner)....",5
649328,OOOPS.... I guess that is what I get for not reading directions. I received my protect yesterday and was BEYOND pleased. These are so CUTE. I love being barefoot and these add a little extra. The quality was better than I thought it was going to be! Now I have to wait another month to get the second one!,4
801384,"I love it! For $15, it's a fun piece. I'm  5'1"" and can wear it without leggings. It hits me just above the knee. I'm bigger on top, so I ordered an XL, but an L would have been fine. It is not super-high quality, but, again, for $15, it is great. I have yet to find anything else quite like it.",5
377014,"For the price it's a no-brainer. Belt is thin but stiff enough to resist roll-over. Works well with my work pants and easier to thread through the loops than some of my thinker belts. Interesting design on the buckle - works well and the bonus is a reassurance. As always, proper use and care of tools, including belt buckles will help you get the most from them.",5
229194,"These cases don't last forever, which is why replacements are available. I usually get at least a year's worth of use before needing to replace the case. I just ordered two cases and the glue has let go on both of them; one after only a couple of hours and the other in less than 24 hours. I'm suspecting they have a bad batch.",1
841913,"Arrived on time and fit perfectly. I bought the bigger size. I would buy the smaller size for my daughter. I think it stays on perfect. My husband says it looks like a handcuff. Oh well. They are never happy with what you wear. As long as it is functional, I am thrilled.",5
740275,"These sweaters are really cute and a great bargain.  They are not the best sweaters in the world, but for $7 + shipping they are fantastic!  I got three - blue, purple, and coffee.  They are all as pictured and super comfy!  I can't wait for it to get cold outside so I can wear them!",4
308500,"This dress looked exactly like what I ordered. I absolutely love the color and the sleeves - they're gorgeous! However, I ordered a large and it is slightly too big on me. Luckily it isn't so big that I won't be able to wear it, but I bought this to wear on the beach and it is a little too long for that. (I'm 5'7"" and it hits just a few inches above my knees). Wish I had ordered a size down, but it's still a beautiful dress!",4

45435,"I purchased this double pack in the hopes that it would help keep my new wedding band set still on my finger. The tubes were very thick and felt uncomfortable at first. After about a week, the tubes would slip off especially after washing my hands.

After trying for a week, I gave up and will look into something else.",3

She loves them almost as much as she loves going barefoot!",5
400147,"This bag is really adorable.  It actually has three pockets in the back, one running the length of the whole figure, another running about halfway down, and the last only being big enough to hold a small cell phone.  All in all, it was big enough to carry clubbing essentials for a small group with all our phones, and was easy to convert to a long strapped purse.",5
831115,"It's a very cute suit. True to size in my opinion (But I am a small). The only problem is that the top and bottom are very see through. I would not wear this suit in public, let alone in the water. It's too bad, it was a cute suit that fit well and was flattering.",2
561968,"This is nothing more than a pair of sweats you could buy at Walmart for less than one fourth of the price. They shrink when you wash them and the bottom is made with elastic. It does not look like it does in the picture. I will not be buying from this company again. And yes, I am aware that they are advertised as sweats. But they look very similar in the picture to the sweater that I bought one time from Adidas. That's what I was hoping for. They are nothing like that",1
843079,This not a bad cowl for the price. It comes packaged in a very small cardboard box so you should blow a balloon up inside upon opening it. It also needs a little help with paint so all I did was lightly go over it with black spray paint. Also adding velcro to the back helps close the seam. This definitely beats buying the rubies mask. If you don't want to spend $200 on a cowl and still want the doj look then you can't beat this price.,4
403094,"I bought this hat for my step father for Christmas to try to get him to stop wearing his ridiculous beanie!  It looks great on him, sophistocated and stylish.  It isn't very thick, so it's definitely not a hat for warmth, but that also means it's not too bulky.  Great, affordable hat for trying out this style.",4

Returning it immediately.  :(",2
218495,Great little boxes.  Two came in a bubble wrapped envelope.  One white with purple bow and one black with a pink bow (or very close to those colors anyway).

Over all, not bad but beware of the size. its about 4"" tall and 3.5"" wide.",3

799026,Super sexy outfit! There is underwire in the top which helps hold everything up. It would probably fit better if I was a little broader in the shoulders but overall it is amazing! It can be a little daunting when it arrives since it's all folded up but just remember the extra little piece of lace goes on the front and not the back and it's easy. Definitely a favorite.,5

It does NOT appear fake and most importantly, I managed to fit in (in addition to the staples of lipgloss, phone, tissues, mirror and keys) a half full package of baby wipes, a diaper and a bib for my 18 month old without making it bulge or appear ridiculous.  It arrived in 2 days in pristine packaging as well. Great buy!",5

I initially thought that the arch support would not be rigid enough for my weight so I tried placing some small gel supports in the space beneath the insole's arch, but that setup got a bit uncomfortable after a while..

It turns out that the way it was designed, with a rigid yet somewhat flexible arch support, actually works better for my feet.",5

Also small enough to go in my front pocket. I keep this is my vehicle with emergency road funds, it has been very handy!",5
343163,"I got these for my son and he loves them. He's on the autism spectrum and he's extremely picky about how shoes fit and feel. He has no issues with these shoes - this is rare. The only problem is, it's barely been 2 months and they're starting to tear up. Ugh. I'm back to order another pair because when a spectrum kid will wear something it's awesome and you go with it. But still, I wish they were a little more durable.",4
378040,"I wished I knew beforehand this shirt was coming from China as their sizes run small. I ordered a large and this fits a little tight. I had expected it to be a little loose. Also, the material is sheer/thin,probably will need to wear a tank underneath. I like this shirt so I will try to make it work,just hope it doesn't shrink when I wash it.",3
294477,"I really wanted to like these, but they are just not quite right. The size is a bit off and the opening hurts when it is closed.  I tried to place it in different ways and places and it just didn't look right. Ithe may just be that I don't have the face for it, but I am not a fan.",2
816572,"I did like the fact that it is a color screen protector, just wish it could have a wet application. That way it'll be really flawless and maybe come out with Red and carbon fiber  maybe. ( just my two cents ) :)  P.S. when I ordered this product, the shipping was very quick",4
384147,"They are the perfect size! These were the first things I put in my septum piercing besides the original barbell, and it was a complete breeze. Yes, they are pretty small, but it's perfect if you want to hide it for work/personal reasons. The clear retainers are very easy to lose, so keep your eyes peeled for them. I completely love them and they're for a great price.",5
764232,"It's very pretty and flattering but a bit big. I think I just ordered it too big. Best if it's a little tight it holds you better.
I got this suit so I can take the straps down to tan. It is good for the money and will be nice for a in between suit.",4
301158,"These little socks are so adorable. They reach just past the knee on my average-sized and chubby-legged 9 month old, which means the cat's face sits on her knee. Too cute! The green is slightly more green and less blue than it looks in the picture, which can make matching them to an outfit slightly more difficult, but they are great. I can see them lasting through the summer, but I don't know if they'll fit past 18 months.",5
788100,"Awesome design and idea, however basically the same experience as the other review; the design is an inch or two lower than appears in the picture, and is unfortunately more like a sleeveless t-shirt rather than a tank top, with the material over your shoulders being a few inches wide rather than an inch or two. I guess not terrifically surprising, as I assumed it's coming from some warehouse in China just banging these out, and the company seems to churn out a lot of ""custom"" printed shirts aka just massive number of possible pictures printed on a shirt",2
193796,"I ordered this adorable skirt for my granddaughter, to be worn in an orchestra concert at school. I took the advice of the other comments made and ordered a Small and it was absolutely perfect! She is 8yrs old, tall and slim and normally wears an 8-10 in jeans from most places, so I would agree that it does run a little big. The material hangs beautifully, keeps it shape when washed and it is not too narrow at the bottom. It can be worn all year 'round and I am ordering one in another color for her.",5
123625,"I was skeptical about buying this skirt because of the 2 sizes to chose from. I am about 5'8 and weigh about 165 pounds. I do however have long legs and this skirt is ROCKIN!!!!! It just covers your butt and it is very very flattering, and I am NOT skinny by any means, but it makes my curves look less flabby than they are, haha. I bought a cupless leather corset to wear with it........it's HOT!!
Oh, I ordered size M/L.",5
363238,"I don't recommend this dress at all. It's like 3 sizes smaller than normal sizes. The material is weird and not what you would expect clothing to feel like. It kind of reminds me of a tablecloth. I could have made it work in a bigger size but when I tried to return it I was told they would just refund me 3% and I wouldn't have to send it back because the delivery cost would be higher than what I paid. All in all, keep looking!",1
316795,"Just got this product after 3 months but costumer service was very helpful and they did a lot to help. I only rated it 4 stars for the shipping time, but it is definitely worth it. It is super fuzzy and adorable! It will fit my friend as a 15 year old so it is not just for little kids. I don't know what others are saying about the two faces but this is perfect for my expectations! It is very good quality for $5! in this pic for size comparison I have a size 7 foot",4
259407,"Super cute... But I should have ordered a large. I'm a 10 and got a medium, because I'm an A cup. The top fits ok, but the bottom is definitely too small. But if I would have gotten a large, the top would be wayyy to big. It's so cute, though. Maybe I can pull it off under a coverup.",4
676563,"I was a little nervous about this purchase after reading so many mixed reviews, but I'm really happy with it! The fabric is thick enough that it shouldn't be see through as is, but I wanted to buy a white swim suit to tie dye - the material is perfect for this! Not thin or shiny fabric. The fit is a little bit small but I'm glad I went with the medium so it won't get saggy when wet. I'm 5'6"", about 125lbs, and wear a 32DDD bra size. The foam boob pads are useless, but not necessary either.",5
682586,"They're super cute. Comfy. They squeak an absolute ton, though.. which is pretty annoying..but I am hoping wearing them more.. or maybe some other tricks I can find online will help with that issue.. Squeaky shoes are not fun.. but over all I do love the boots. The color is great.. It's not too red, it's just the right amount of a wine sort of color. They're kind of witchy-style... which I love!",5
419809,Love the quality of this bracelet!  I have looked at other bracelets and this has a much stronger chain on it which lets me know that it is made to last.  The engraving on the backside of the bracelet is fabulous and you are able to read it very well with it being engraved in black.  I would highly recommend this brand of medical jewelry to anyone that is needing one.,5
873481,My granddaughter could not have loved this make up kit more!  She spent five days here and used it at least twice a day.  She was overjoyed with it.  She's 7 years old and she had no problem with opening or using any of the products.  It was easy for her to store things back in the case so clean up was a breeze.  I loved the smile this kit put on her face.......,5
177967,"Looks Great BUT when I opened it, some of the stiching looked a little lose. Nothing that will make much of damage any time soon. When I opened it and saw the inside of the visor, the, what I assume is an extra layer of protective plastic was almost melted off or torn. It looked damaged. Im only using this for one day but still dissapointed. Photos are before it was even used by me, straight out of the package. So many scratches on the inside. If it wasn't damaged I would give this 5 stars.",2
36264,"I bought this to make a Jelly Fish costume and it was a HUGE hit! My daughter felt so special in this and children and adults alike where ooing and ahing and ""had to touch the jelly fish!"" I can only attest to how wonderful it is for costumes as we don't use it for an umbrella.",5
11726,Not bad insoles. A little high for me but my boyfriend is wild about them. I have flat feet and plantar fasciitis for three years. He barely has plantar fasciitis in one foot but wears boots and needs a good support under him. He complains that he needs more of them.,4
824991,I really like the hat but it didn't even ship in a box.  It just ships in a plastic bag.  There are parts on the hat that are already cracked and I am not sure of the longevity it will have since it is already damaged.  I don't understand how anyone would consider shipping any type of a hat in anything other than a box.,1
470873,"Cute, but you get what you pay for. I love the idea of this product, but you can tell it is inexpensive. The cut out heart is uneven and it looks like it is dirty. I can't complain too much because I didn't expect it to be high quality. It is still something I will wear, and I love the idea behind it.",3
120755,"As other reviewers have stated, this swim diaper left a rash on our son's groin area for a few days.  It is also undersized even for the 4T around the legs.  It was okay for a 30 minute swim lesson class, but a morning (3 hours) at the beach caused the rash.

We got the My Pool Pal instead and it is doing much better.  No rash, sized right, but boring in just blue.",1
615284,"My best cap from many I purchased! Goes well with dressing up. I wish they had more colors in this style. It has elastic on back for snug fit, so wind should not  take it off your head. Light fabrics what allows good air circulation. Wish it went lower on back to cover hair line or lack of.
Worth the money!",5
819311,"Top fit okay, but the bottoms were way too small. Bought for my daughter who has always fitted perfectly into any small size swim suit. Afraid to return to get a larger size and then the top would be too big. She just wears the top with another suit bottom.",3
565704,"This hat looks so cute on the model. Sadly, it didn't look so cute on me. The ear flaps stuck out some distance from my ears, and were very long, so would not have kept my ears warm. As another reviewer had mentioned, the elastic on the end of the ear flaps to go over the buttons on the side of the hat, when not using the ear flaps, are quite cumbersome. It's too bad. I liked the color and the fur fringe. It really does look so cute on the model.",2
171804,"I would have given this product three stars because when the product arrived I noticed after opening it that it was missing one rhinestone. I did not send it back because it is not that noticeable. It did arrive before the estimated arrival date, but it still took over a week and a half to get here. The belly button ring is still very pretty, and maybe my product just happened to be missing a rhinestone. I'm sure other ones would be fine.",4
802846,The first one I received the pattern was slightly different and had an awkward spot on the front that didn't look like anything. So I ordered another one and it is perfect. Just as the picture shows. This dress is so cute and my daughter loves it so much. It's light weight and will be perfect for the summer.,4
464720,"My toddler wore this at 14 months and it fit just fine.  Because it's knitted it does stretch a bit so i suspect she will be able to wear it for the next holiday season as well.  Her head is a bit smaller than average, which is why in my opinion, it would fit ages 9 months and up well.  It's also super cute and I got compliments every time she wore it.",5
502527,"This shirt looks absolutely ridiculous, its super long in the front and back, not loose at all, and the front is cut so low that it doesnt cover my bra at all but slips under it. I tried everything I could to make it work but just couldnt. And unfortunately I ordered two. Its not worth returning either, just save your money",1
367628,"I'm 5'7"" about 120 and the medium fit me just fine. I really like this dress and have received many complements. I was unsure if I would like it since it's one piece, and the jacket isn't really a jacket. This also came with a belt which I wasn't expecting. Great price for this dress.",5
508573,"First off, this vendor had incredibly fast shipping. I have a hard time finding girls cleats in my daughter's size locally. I ordered these last year and loved them, she grew out of them, so I came on Amazon looking for a second pair. These are great cleats at a great price!",5
549873,I ordered this wig and it was said to arrive Aug. 28th. It arrived on the 15th. I enjoyed that it came earlier than expected. The pony tail is a clip that is removable and you can put it where you like to. The pink bow however wasn't included. The wig itself is thick and nicely made. Easily style-able and comfortable to ware..,5
877883,"Have had these for a 2 years now, and they are still top-notch. I have them on my work loafers, bowling shoes, two pairs of work shoes, and ""going out"" shoes.

If you just jam your foot in, you'll crush the shoe's back wall. Pull from the back of the shoe as you put it on (and tongue if you use 2 hands), and you'll avoid the damage to that part of the shoe.",5

492361,"I have received so many compliments on this dress. I'm so happy that I bought it. I've included three pictures. Ignore the messy room lol.
I ordered a medium and I am 5""1 and I weigh 124lbs. The chest can be a little tight. I am a 34D so if you are my size but have bigger breasts, I would go for a large. Hope this has helped!

p.s. I wanted to show where the dress cuts off. It does cut off at the knee. :)",5
671065,"Not 501st approved. The Buckle is too rounded at the corners and the code disc is not right at all.
I bought this with the rank and officer hat black. The only useable piece was the hat code disc. Everything else was a waste of money.
With that said. The finish on the buckle is really nice. And the leather belt is cheap leather. But nicely finished. If you are buying for 501st approval don't waste your money but for general cosplay or Halloween. It's perfect",1
326734,"Very bad fabric, the dress design in picture doesn't look anything like what you will get. I wanted this for gathering party and the theme is blue. Now i need to look for another! If I see it in real life I won't take it for free. Keep your money and look for another dress.",1
538844,"The credit card slots are a little tricky to use, and the space for addition cards behind this slot do nothing. You might as well be sandwiching the card between the two flaps. Half the time I've opened it, a gift card or ID have gone flying.

With that said, the wallet does look sharp, and fits better than most Tyveks at holding money. If you can get away with minimal cards, it's a solid choice.",2
305134,"I bought a size 10, it fits a little short, not awful but definitely on the short side.  My kid is happy w/ the tie and pocket square. It looks cute.  The tie is actually an elastic strap looped around the neck, not a ""real"" tie.  It's fine for a kid but I didn't realize that was what it was going to be.  It'll work ok, but it won't last long after washing and drying a couple of times... ( sleeves too short ).",3
97798,"The material of this shirt is a decent weight, but the cut is different then the picture. It is not long at all and the sleeves are an awkward length. They are longer than 3/4 and shorter than full sleeves. I am 5'6"" so by no means tall. The length falls a little longer than waist length. It is also tighter than it appears. I would not recommend this to anyone.",1
874731,If you are going to rock a fascinator and need one in a stunning blue this one is it. It's not too big that it overpowers the rest of your look it just brings it all together. I had a blast wearing this with a dress the same shade of blue. Makes it easy for your date to find you in a crowded room. Go for it.,5
475728,"Fabric was dense and scratchy, not soft at all. I purchased the red color and it was faded; did not look like what's pictured. This sweater felt one size smaller than what I purchased (I have very small arms but these sleeves were too tight even on me).  The shape of the sweater hugs tightly around the abdomen/hips. Returned to seller.",1
613585,"I really love this bag. I use this tote bag for work. I got a lot of compliments from colleagues. The top part is genius leather. The space is sufficient for an A4 files.

19963,LOVE this hat.  It is so difficult to find a hat that fits my 6 month old daughter.  The sizes for hats are like 6-18 months which is a huge gap.  What is so special about this one is the adjustable string for around the head.  So I can adjust this hat as her head continues to grow.  The fabric is nice too.,5
663708,"I am 5'11"" and a size 4 with a very straight figure.

I bought this sweater in Bordeaux - Medium.

I sized up, because I am tall.  I was concerned about shoulder room and sleeve length.  The sleeve length is perfect on the medium.  It is a little big overall, but it drapes nicely and it still looks really good.

We have had some unseasonably cooler weather and I have gotten to wear it a few times.  Very happy.",5
232499,"I got the purple one with the hearts, it is well put together and lovely on my wrist. It is a nice piece for the price, especially. It is a teeny bit loose even on the tightest link in the fastener chain so it should fit up to a 9-1/2"" wrist with no problems whatsoever.",5
575685,"Its an alright jacket, can't complain much given the awesome price.  Its very well made and looks great! It could do with side pockets for hands though. I usually wear medium and ordered XXL given the reviews and the size chart and it fits me just right. I haven't gotten a chance to wash it yet, so don't know if the arms will shrink and it will stop fitting me.",4

highly recommend!",5
705419,"The Item does not fit as the way its displayed on line on the model. From behin dit covers her entire behind but when I received it sad to say it fits like a THONG.

Thanks anyway",3
186987,"Saw these on a baby at the zoo, we asked the mom and she said Kushies. Searched online, found and purchased. They arrived in 3 days not 7, faster than expected for us. They fit good, my son is not a huge fan, but you have to protect their eyes. The toddler size fits his head well, at 6 months he can wear them and he's on the larger size.",5

It is a great length and never have problem with coloring or turn my neck or finger colors. Great work.",5
524548,"I ordered this shirt for my son, and he really likes it. An archery enthusiast, he also needed to come up with a Robin Hood costume for a fairy tale murder mystery party. This shirt allowed us to supply part of that costume while giving him a cool new shirt for everyday. The screen printing is really crisp. The sizing seems to be spot on. The only thing that was different is that the green is darker than we had anticipated. We would definitely order it again and may be doing so when he outgrows this size.",5
21693,I bought this after seeing my friends daughter had one. We love that the strap on the back allows you to make the hat custom fit your child's head. My daughter isn't able to pull it off and it doesn't slide down over her eyes like a normal sun hat.,5
609388,"It's super soft and looks like it does in the picture, esp from the back...VERY over-sized.  The only thing that is disappointing is that there are slits down both sides of the shirt that start around the top of your bra and go down the bottom of the shirt.  I don't see this represented anywhere, but maybe I overlooked it?

I'll have to see if there is something that I can wear under the shirt so it would be a little more appropriate.",3
319630,"The ring is very, very dainty. It is cute and looks just like the picture, however, it looks more like it is for a very young child (7 years and younger). I am a little concerned about the fit for the person I purchase this for, but we will see.",3
263809,I normally don't buy underwear online but after getting these I was pleasantly surprised. They fit amazing! I have a larger backside and they do let a good bit of cheek out of the bottom on the back but I don't mind that. They don't crawl up and they wash very well. A definite thumbs up!,5
768497,"By the time it got to me, some stones were missing.  It was not packaged very well.  It's very pretty; but I can only suggest wearing it for a short time and wash it to avoid oil and dirt setting on it.  Not quite sure of the material.

Again,
Once or twice for a special, yes.  But, definitely not a set that I would recommend to someone with sensitive skin.",4

But they are super comfortable and the price is right.,5

Sadly to say, that for it's purposes as a trail shoe I was disappointed. Although the overall look has improved (finally one that's all-black), the functionality has not. Too much rubber/plastic has been incorporated into the design and as a result, every time you take a step you feel the the plastic/rubber bending on-top - which distracts from the running or walking experience.

UPDATE:
As of last year, I wore the soles down so much, I had zero traction on wet surfaces.  The outer soles are REALLY soft, which is great for traction on rough surfaces, as long as you have tread.  They are still the most comfortable boot I ever wore.",4

865696,"I gave these 3 stars, bc they are not true to size. I normally get a 1 or 2 X. I ordered a 3X. I ordered these for a Florida trip i am taking. They will make nice tops, but not a dress nor swimsuit cover. it also does not look to be as nice of a fabric as in the pictures. Still not a bad buy, for the price.",3
110860,"I was expecting this to be much bigger and it's actually fairly tiny. They rose itself is beautiful as pictured but its pretty small. I'll wear it but I was a little sad that the pendant wasn't bigger. If you're wanting it to be bigger like I was, I wouldn't recommend this product. It came quickly though so that's good I guess",3
175421,Purchased this in the AB Gold and it is spectacular.  I have have several purses 10xs the price of this and they do not make me smile the way this one does!  Workmanship is top notch.  The long chain is beautiful.  This is a show stopper and I'm certain it will get many compliments over the years.  Thank you for this beautiful piece of art.  Also I should mention the box that stores it is lovely as well!,5
778878,"ordered it exactly a week before my sisters birthday at great wolf lodge (it came just in time, a day early actually) got a size XXXL , I'm 5'2 weigh140. The top looked a little cheaper in person than the photo & fit just a tadddd too small but was still comfy if I kept adjusting the strappy bits. That was annoying.. but in my opinion but overall a great buy so cute the & bottom fit like a dream.",4
50779,"This did its job, but maybe I expected more. It creased right away, and the creases never straightened out so it stopped serving its purpose, almost. But, it did help when I wore it several hours a day. I was only able to get about one month use out of it.",4
882627,"I am a plus size woman (size 22/24) and was nervous to purchase this swimsuit at first. I am so glad that I did. It fits wonderfully and seems to be well made. The bust line is very flattering and somewhat adjustable with the halter neck ties. The skirt hits perfectly, it's not so long as to be matronly, but is what I would call flirty instead. I definitely recommend this swimsuit/brand as it fit and looked better than some of the $100+ swimsuits I recently bought at plus size stores.",4
52845,"I purchased this hat for my 14 month old granddaughter.  It is a bit large but is adjustable.  Living in Texas, we have to always be aware of the heat and the sun.  This hat provides a lot of protection from the sun for my little granddaughter.  Of course it helps that she loves hats.  I expect to get several years of use out of it since it is adjustable.  The color is bright pink and is close to the color in the photo.",5
510945,"I ordered these socks thinking they would be too small for me (my hunter boots are a size 9), but they fit perfectly! They are exactly what I was looking for and needing to turn my hunter boots into winter boots. We have had a decent amount of snow this year in Tennessee so I needed these",5
329547,These are great belts! The buckle is YKK a long known top quality brand in zippers. It works easily but stays put if the belt end stays against your pantsThe nylon web is thick and solid. It is also easily reduced in length. I do it at the buckle because I don't want to lose the shaping of the open end.,5

I am not pleased that it took 3 weeks to arrive and now I have to return it...",2
675109,"The jacket is cute but it runs too short. I wear size Small (32C, 5'5 with short torso). Size S in this jacket fits like it's Petite, a bit snug and length is not enough for a warm Fall jacket (not like at the picture). It will be great for a shorter height though.",3
106606,"I gave this two stars because what the picture doesn't show is that from should to wrist of both sleeves is a strip of sheer material. Totally not my style plus where the sheer strip is, it shows your bra straps. :( If not for the sheer I would wear this often",2
820034,"This is a great skirt.  Nice texture, no pilling,  I do wish it had a more defined waist with more elastic. It tends to slip down a bit.  You might try a size smaller.  It stays up, but if I needed to run from zombies, it would slip down and they would get me for sure.",4
378233,"The dress was beautiful and it delivered as expected. The boning was odd so it made lacing up difficult without it looking funny from the back. After wearing for most of the day, there were sharp pieces poking out at me from the top of the dress so if I bent down slightly, I originally purchased a 4, but my breastfeeding breasts could not fit, so I had to go a size up and the 6 was a little loose and it took 4 hands to lace me in. But I got many compliments!",3
145435,"I am 5'7"" and usually wear a size 6. These fit really well lengthwise ( actually a little long). The fit in my waist is snug but not too much. I was surprised by the one size fits all but it fits me. If you are petite these may be too long or loose.",5
858016,Went perfect with my bustier for my 35th bday. I'm a size 24 and wide at the bottom. It was very short in the back but I rocked it. Just had to be cautious of bending over or I was gonna flash the world. I still got my twerk on!,4
650041,I ordered this sandel and it only lasted a week the company got in touch with me asked me how did I think they could have improved it a second pair was sent out at no cost to me and thong was reinforced much better my Granddaughter loves them so far so good.,5
311280,"If you but these cost it with Kamar Varinsh. It is a glossed used on costume jewelry, art, painting etc... It works great. Let dry for 2-5 hours. I say 2-4 at best. You should never purchase costume jewelry and not expect it to turn or cheap. You have to protect it.",5

288401,I was very disappointed when I tried on the pants and realized they had not been cut to the same size for each leg. One side fit great and the other was way to tight. They would have been great workout pants if the size was the same in both legs.,1
539896,"THESE SOCKS ARE AWESOME! I got them as a small little extra Christmas gift for my wifewho loves all things Bride of Frankensteinand they are perfect.

The seller was also very understanding when I originally mixed up my purchases and gave these (and them) a very bad review by accident. Rest assured that the socks are absolutely perfect, the seller quite professional, and I will be purchasing from them again!",5
702430,I love how this sweatshirt fits and how soft it is! It's exactly what I expected but ORDER TWO SIZES UP from your normal size :) I followed the comment's advice and I'm so glad I did. I'm usually a medium so I got an XL and it fits great with a tiny bit of wiggle room.,5
652186,"This product fitted me perfectly, only because I'm a XXS girl, this product would not be good for a curvy girl since its sizing is way off and they're very small. I read the reviews and ordered a small knowing what i would get and i was not disappointed at all, the fabric is nice and it fits me as I expected.",5
784884,"I really like the design of this necklace. It is very sturdy material, with a strong magnetic closure. The felt pads are easy to switch out, and add oils to. The chain length is perfect to keep the oil scent near, without being overbearing, as long as you do only 2 or 3 drops. I will happily wear this around home or out and about.",5
681573,"It took about a month and a half to receive this item, and the seller was very nice in their communications, but when I got it, I can't wear it.  The breast cups are too close together, although I do have a wide chest. I don't feel like I can wear it without smashing everything into the center of my chest, and that looks ridiculous.  The bottoms fit perfectly though, and the fabric is surprisingly nice for the price.",3
637207,"I like my Vans. I know that eventually I will love my Vans, because like my last pair they will be faithfully with me for as long as a beloved pet, and will stretch out just enough and retain that great springiness that I love so much. I bought my 11yo son his first pair this year because he actually skateboards (unlike me) and needs their comfort and reliability.",5
380902,"I cannot say enough great things about this product!  These are high-quality, super-sticky (no slip!) pasties that come in a handy storage case.  I wore them all day and night at a wedding during 90 degree temps.  Even though I was dancing and sweating all night, these did not slip or fall off!  I am a fan for life!",5
308070,"My husband bought me this for Christmas & I was wary of it fitting right since it is one six but it is perfect! It's fits my 29 inch waist comfortably, it's not too small or too big but there is plenty more room for it to stretch. I would say this should fit anywhere from a size small to large maybe even extra large.",5
101583,"I received this watch today and was really surprised how nice it looks. It has all the features I need. It displays time in both analog and digital,  in both standard and 24 hour format, if desired.  Also has timer and alarm functions.  In the dark the digital read-out can be illuminated by pushing a button. I like this watch so much I'm going to order another one ASAP.",5
633552,"I LOVE this purse! I have gotten numerous compliments on it and it is the perfect size for me. I'm not a ""Big Bag"" gal. The strap might be a little short for some but it easily goes over your shoulder and can be adjusted to be shortened. There are 4 pockets, 2 on the outside and two inside. It is a cloth material not faux leather. I would describe the cloth as almost a heavy non ribbed corduroy.",5
601279,"Quality was good for the price. The print is very clear, more like a picture. Shipping was about  6 days. Size was incredibly small, I'm size M-L 5'5 150lbs and I was able to put it on bc the fabric stretches a lot, but it did not look good. It fit me more like a XS. Overall it's a nice looking shirt, it was a shame it's too small.",2
719824,"I love this blouse! It is elegant, great for business casual events and for young adults, such as myself. It's somewhat small, but it still fit me well and it was not too tight on me. SUCH A GREAT PURCHASE! TOTALLY RECOMMEND! Although, what I found weird is that I ordered the black and white stripped one but got a navy blue white stropped one. I still loved it though. GREAT SHIPPING! Ordered it Monday and I received it Wednesday morning.",5
719684,"These are nice for the price!!  The fit/comfort is perfect.  The lenses are very dark, but not too dark.  The box that they come in is NOT wood, however, but it will make a nice holder.  The arms do appear very like Bamboo, and, in general, a really classic-look to the styling.",4
92416,"I bought the same size that I normally wear in this style shirt from Destination XL.  However, this may have been sized incorrectly as it was very tight.  Everything else that I have purchased at Destination XL has been exceptional.  I would have returned it but it was already laundered.",2
152730,"This dress was beautiful but a total disappointment as far as fit is concerned, waaay too small so i suggest getting a medium if you are a size 2-4 anything above an 8 i would get large/xlge. I really wanted to wear this for Christmas but couldn't get over the tightness as well as how short it was, up above my thighs but the picture shows just above the knee. good looking dress but very decieving!",3
329321,"I bought 2 covers, for 24"" and 28"" Samsonite hardcase.  The materials look sturdy (I haven't traveled yet, so can't comment on the strength) and easy to slip on.  The 24"" fits perfectly. A 5 star rating for this.  However, on the 28"" one,  the 2 openings for the Top and Side handles don't fit perfectly.  It's off by at least 1.5 inch.  I gave a 3 star rating for this.",4
451974,This is pretty loose on my head. I am a small person but one fits all usually works. It is a pretty hat and well priced so I have kept it as it will work if it's not too andy and it rarely is out here. perfect to keep you  hair dry between the stores and your car.,3
717268,"These are soft and really comfortable. My only complaint was that a couple of them have started falling apart just after one wash, one has a large hole/tear between the fabric and lace and one has loose threads  coming off. Be sure to wash these on delicate or do not dry so they last.",4
807876,"This review is for the Aurora Tears Sterling Silver and Amethyst ear rings.

The quality of these ear rings is quite good. The stones are of a good size as expected. Not too large as to be ostentatious or inappropriate for daily wear.

The review sample received for testing is well made, and was easy to put on and remove. Looks expensive",5
487614,"The top is cute, but these are very cheap, and the pants are NOT what is pictured! They are green and orange, not green and red, like the picture. The top doesn't match the bottom at all, and this was what I planned to put my daughter and son in for their Christmas morning pictures. Now I have nothing to put them in, because the package arrived on Christmas Eve, and there is no time to get anything else. I'll have to put them in regular pants with these tops. Disappointing!",1
647910,"VERY Happy with these cleats.  I have played to games in them RIGHT out of the box and no blisters! (VERY impressive).  They feel very light and very sturdy.  Make you feel a bit more fleet of foot.  I also am a fan of the inner lining ""boot"" as I play on turf- so they do a GREAT job to prevent those pellets from getting in your cleat... I might buy a couple more pairs just to hold on to for later down the road!",5
611629,I'm 5'8 and 128 pds. I normally wear a 8 and got the large. It's a good deal meaning the price. The material isn't high quality but works. The dress is a little bigger than I'd normally wear but after reading the reviews I went with the L. It does fit just has a little room. I actually prefer that anyway. A girls gotta eat.,3
740903,"They do what their supposed to, but after about two months of normal use (walking and standing) the rubber toe guard on one has begun to peel.

67681,"I am very happy with this ring.  On my hand the green color seems even subtler than in the pic -- for the price, I am happy to find a pretty ring where the band won't turn weird colors:)  I've ordered other similar rings through Amazon and always liked them.  Obviously, at $19.99 this is not ""high-end"" jewelry, but I am very happy with the quality of this ring.  So pretty and lots of compliments!",5
623321,"The material for this dress was awesome... sturdy and soft... the color was beautiful... however it was a little to big in the chest area. I am usually I a size 4 or 6 in dresses, so  I got a large which fit everywhere else... but the chest. This one is made for ladies with a little more on top :)",4
64752,"Fits great, washes great, not the softest cotton but my 4 yr old son doesn't complain. It's difficult to find underwear that doesn't have the newest TV/ movie superheros all over it. I don't promote TV, especially not that violent stuff. Why is it so difficult to print kid's clothing with nice things and colors?",5

TRY THEM!!!!!",5
485047,"The cut of these pants is too tight to be a harem pant. If you're really skinny, it would maybe look like a harem pant on you. However, if you have hips, or thighs of any kind, these pants just look like regular pants. They have quite a slim leg fit too. Again, they're only going to have a baggy fit on very skinny individuals.

The waist is also a little tight. I don't think anyone above a size 8 would be comfortable with these. These would be best for people size 6 and below.",3
595547,This hat was so cute on my nephew. It fit just a little big which is good cause he's an infant now. It is made out of nice material and seems very well made. It is a very cute hat and I definitely recommend getting this. It is very warm so it's perfect for this winter!,5
212505,"Little too big on me and little too short. I was hoping to be a little above my knees and its more than that.
 But it's very comfortable and I got a lot of complements even I know that the quality of the fabric it's not the best. I'm afraid that after washing it 3 or more times it will be damaged and stretch.",4
619308,"I thought I already submitted a review through Amazon, upon receipt? Anyway, these are great vests. Lightweight but not see through.

I haven't had a chance to wear the navy one yet but Im sure its as nice as the black one.",5

727135,"I got the Flat Orange as I gift and couldn't be happier.  Great glasses/goggles for the price.  You can't go wrong with these. I wear these when I ride my CVO Road King.  The elastic strap is great for keeping them close to your face. With the padded insert I don't get hardly any wind buffering, even at high speeds.",5
77871,I bought this for my 3 month old son's baptism.  It was soft and a nice alternative to the other baptism outfits for boys.  My only issue with the garmet is that the pants don't have much of an elastic at the waist.  That being said they did hold up on my baby's big belly.  I would recommend this product.,4

For me who wears between medium/large, when ordering from these countries it seems i would have to go two to three sizes up to get a decent fit. Item also didn't initially show up after the expected delivery date and indicated it was delivered, so i had to call Amazon to help with this third-party seller.",1
691384,"The hard ridge on the heel chafed my ankles badly and made the shoes unusable. However I was able to send them back for a full refund with no problem. The issue may have been that they were too loose (I ordered my usual size of 9.5), but I didn't want to take the risk of replacing them with a smaller size to see if it that fixed the issue.",2

742807,"Way too large, neck area was really off in fit, and I believe I got a defective one because the button was in the wrong place. I wanted to love it but I looked 3x the size I really am.

It was a pretty color though.",1

I didn't realize I was only allowed to bring a clear bag but luckily they didn't notice me holding this in my hand when I went through security. I was able to fit quite a bit inside. My phone (which is on the bigger side), makeup, money, and even an extra dress in case I wanted to change. That dress came in handy for sure!

Update: I haven't even used this again and the strap frayed off from where it connected to the pack.",2

The colors are vibrant, and the sole has plenty of grip, even on a slippery floor. I wore them for most of the day and they are comfortable.

Overall, I'm very pleased with this shoe.",5
98244,These are wonderful for pregnancy and I'll be ordering them again but don't be fooled--they are not leggings. They are footless tights. Sadly I realized this too late and took my baby to the doctor's office wearing them with just a long shirt--the whole office got a lot more show than they bargained for that day,4

The material is so heavy that they should have considered this while designing the over hang on the other side as the entire top pulls to one side and generally feels badly made. Well considering I bought the last one in stock on Amazon, good for the rest of you.",2

It is slimming and doesn't bunch up very much, but my favorite part is that the bra actually holds my breasts well while also opening up for nursing well. That is a magic combination! I am happy with the purchase and will probably get another one.",5
612706,Great fit. The dress is very wrinkled from being shipped in a tiny bag and it is a satin material so a little tricky to get the wrinkles out. The dress is beautiful and does not look tacky. One downside is the train is about 3 ft behind me which will not work as a homecoming or prom dress because it will get stepped on or get dirty at pictures and dinner. Will have to get that altered.,5

What makes it outstanding to me is the buckle dynamic; instead of the age-old knurled rolling pin push-pull routine, this buckle opens by pulling out on the belt & locks by just closing the buckle down. This design has been too long coming. As with all Levi products, I anticipate years of service from this belt.",5

The only slight I can report is that the spring for the clasp is a bit tight, pressing them in place well, but hard enough to crumple the cigs (Camel Turkish Royal).

The quality for the money is very high, and I'm sure that clasp will loosen with more use.",5
822375,Just what I was looking for! This belt fits my jeans and cords that are just a bit loose in the waist or the ones that tend to bunch. It stays in shape and the buckle is flat so it doesn't stick out under T-shirts and clingy fabrics! It even comes with 2 buckles!,5
407770,"I bought this thinking this was an adult costume. It arrived as a childs costume. The package said girls medium 8-10 , girls large 12-14, teen 6-8, it would only be suitable for kids and PRE-teens. But it was ok quality for the price. I wear wouldn't wear this for anything other than a last minute halloween costume",2
274289,"The backside of the best clearly marks the waist measurement so it's easy to figure out how much to cut off to size the belt. Also, the clasp on the underside for the strap was very strong, so the belt attached to the clasp easily and securely.

The ratchet is nice and the belt looks very premium. I haven't had it long so I can't attest to durability, but as far as easy of use and style, I'm loving this thing.",5
201740,"don't buy this clothes, way too small, not even compared to xsmall in US sizing, and the seller won't take it back for free shipping for its poor sizing that means this item is not refundable at all as it costs more for international shipping than this clothes, buy it at ur own risk, and I'm sure u will end up paying more for sending it back to seller! very poor seller service as well! not even worth for 1 star!",1
84028,My expectation was met and glad that my friend and her daugther loved it!!! I saw the picture with my god daugther wearing the pj's. I will definitely order more on this website. I was told that the quality is great and its a 100% cotton! Perfect gift! Satisfied customer. It was also delivered on time.,5
736590,"I do love it.  Fit is very small, had to send first one back and order 3 sizes larger than my usual size.  Once I got the right size I loved it, so still gave 5 stars. I get a lot of compliments on the pink one!  I'm sure it's an Asian size, I think it states that on the description.  If you keep that in mind and order large, it should be OK",5
498705,"It's exactly what I thought it would be. It's slim and the size fits. It seems to be durable. Glad I bought it. I never would have found something in the store like this and for how cheap it is that would have never happened.

I received this product at discount price so that I may test them and share my honest and unbiased review",5
164773,"These are an almost spot on dupe for Lululemon, & specifically the Yoga Capris (of the 90 degree leggings) are so soft. They fit like a glove. Compared to the Tummy Control Shapeware (which is obviously tighter, & a little more elastic), these are nice for lounging, yoga, & if you're bloating (it has a little more give). Colors are BEAUTIFUL, & STRONGLY recommend",5
559763,I received my order more than a month after the expected date of delivery. This was due to strikes in South Africa. The service from Amazon and Finejo was excellent! The jackets runs very small. Luckily I have read reviews and ordered a XXL for my Medium daughter and a XXXL for myself which is a Large. These fit just right. Very satisfied with my purchase.,5
767997,"The quality of the product is really nice, especially for the price that it is. Although, the sizing goes by Asian sizes, so I recommend you get two sizes larger than what you normally are. EX: I got a medium because that what I am in America, but with Asian sizing I need an XL.",3
59490,"This apron is exactly what I need to protect my clothes as I wash a dish or two, or need something to tastefully cover my clothes from cooking effects, whatever.

I LOVE it in black, it looks, well, almost, formal.

I can't stand full, dowdy aprons, and this little apron is PERFECT, as it doesn't FEEL like I'm wearing an apron, yet it does the job.

LOVE IT.",5
426641,"This is so cute!  I bought it one size up because I didn't want it too be snug as I get bigger.  The insert is easy to use and zips into place.  The only reason this didn't get 5 stars is because I didn't notice that the pockets are to be used from the top vs the side, which is a little awkward, but not something I can't get over.  I can also see that this will be something I can use post pregnancy. I'm pretty happy with this purchase!",4
434503,"I love this dress, but it is a little big. I typically wear a small and the 6/8 was a little larger than I would have liked. I had to hem up the length but it was very easy to do with some hemming tape that you iron. The dress is soft and flattering. Worth the money! Shipping does take a while though so order ahead of time!",4
55462,"Ok, I have to admit. I purchased this for an off-label use.....it protects the knees of my pants when I need to crawl into my chicken run to do a bit of maintenance cleanup.  But the material is very comfortable. It resists staining, but when it does, my type of staining is vital to get washed out. This apron washes very nicely.  It stays tied and in place, which is a neat trick as I'm generally crawling on it.  Pockets are a bonus!

This apron could handle serving customers beautifully!",5
528839,"LOVED it! The pants were a little long, but you couldn't even tell I rolled them up! My 2 year old wore the costume twice without any complaints! The shirt is very light weight which is a huge plus living in Florida! We didn't see anyone having the same costume either! Definitely recommend!",5
57881,"Great price, great product.  I wore my last Vera Bradley ID wallet out.  I am not a name brand person, and my daughter-in-law bought me my first one.  But because it lasted 3 years, I decided to buy another one.  This is my actual purse.  It is everything I need and I don't have to worry about forgetting it because it is with my keys all of the time.  LOVE IT!!!!",5
287615,Beautiful but the XL my normal size was way too small.  I will keep it and probably give it to one of my family members and see if I can buy another one that fits.  It is really beautiful and the lace is heavier and not a lite yarn.  This makes it hang well.  This item will look better on a flat chested female as shown in the photo. Large breasted women will have to go at least 2 sizes larger!,2
233563,"Great product. Only flaw is that the case for the glasses is not an adhesive stick-on to the back of my current phone case.. the actual phone case and the glasses holder are together as one case. And unfortunately, I have an iPhone 6s Plus so this case does not fit my phone and now I have these little glasses to keep track of.",4
776537,"I bought two different styles/  this one is to large and the other one is nothing like the color in the picture,  but it  is a great fit!!  THEY STATE THAT  ONE SIZE FITS ALL!  I DON'T THINK SO! !!!!  PICTURE IS NOT  THE SAME COLOR OR STYLE.",3
134047,The Hearts Are Lovely. but The Necklace came With The Chain Twisted All Through The Heart And The Earrings Were Missing the Hoop That Goes Through The ear. This Was a Christmas gift so I did not realize everything was messed up until my granddaughter opened The Box. Very Embarrassing.,1
539265,This does run small. I actually wear an xl but I got 2xl to be safe and it was tight I mean I barely could get it over my boobs. But I did I looked amazing and mission was accomplished my day was beautiful. I gave it 3 stars because it does run small in American size.,3
354056,I had a great wallet for years until it was no longer usable. For years I used a simple hair tie to hold my cards and cash together. After finding this wallet and using it for a while I regret nothing. This wallet works great if you don't have very many cards. It holds 2 cards per slit but it is a tight fit and hard to pull one out at times.l but a great wallet nevertheless.,5
150563,I love this veSt! The shipping was super fast too! Yes the size is small but what do you expect when its an Asian seller? The other reviewers should have just been more careful in viewing the size. Overall it is of great quality and I have seen this exact item for more than twice the price in retail stores. Great seller will buy again :),5
754210,I bought these for halloween and they were perfect!!! the came with some molding wax so that they fit well in your mouth. For anyone who has cavities and has ever had that tingly feeling from something hitting your filling these don't hurt. I have a filling on the front of one of my teeth and there was no sensitivity!,5
691790,"My stones did not match each other well at all. (1 Dark shade then 1 light shade of same pair) I'm a size 0 and these were too small. I lost my second White Jade set I owned and was pretty excited to get new stones in so it kinda sucked they just drooped down and out. I'm bad at returns too so idk if I can even find what I was actually looking for now. I recommend to other people finding bigger flares in the front, these ones are rounded and small, it almost feels all one level. :(",1
489839,"Utter junk. It gets 1 star only because 1/10 star is not an option.  The back cover of the watch case does not even come close to fitting or staying on. There is no possible way that an actual person checked this item before shipping and thought ""oh yeah!  This is perfect"" A waste of money and time. It's so bad it's almost funny. Almost.",1
515079,I really loved these and so far a lot of people said they are cute and where'd I get them from. I'm glad they have more than one to sell and different colors. I lost my first pair. When I get the money I am getting another pair to replace them in black and maybe get a different colored second pair too. They are my favorite armwarmers. Thanks for having a good inventory on this item and different colors to choose from. At least it has a lot in stock so I loose them again it's possible to replace them.,5
854607,"OK. The black version of these is AWESOME. I had a pair for three years and got tons of compliments. However, the red ones come with a lovely Prop 65 warning on them saying something in them causes cancer, birth defects, etc. Possibly cadmium paint? Not the kind of thing I want around me or my baby (who, incidentally, destroyed my pair of the black glasses when he found them and smashed them and probably chewed on them).",1
443815,"These are light gray and the reading area is almost up to the middle of the lens, so useful primarily for reading or close work in sunlight. The size is somewhat small for typical ""American"" faces but maybe fine for Asian etc. These cannot be used as ""safety glasses"" but are ok as dark-shaded readers. Nice design but nose pads pinch the nose. Unfortunately, only available in +4.00 power.",3
451410,"The first week of use, my 6 years old daughter left one with lost of holes, I think she must have pulled some threads with something sharp, I think this because now is October and only one of the five shirts is still decent to wear (no threads out). The royal blue is extremely dark, more like a navy blue... and the fit is super big for a girl, I had to take them to fix the sleeve to be more girlish. Both of my daughters hated them, I started buying polo shirts for both again in another brand.",1
543094,I love this product.  Bought originally at a local boutique for much more and decided to purchase more online.  The size is big enough to use as a blankie in a pinch for my 2 month old. Also the thin fabric is perfect to roll up and keep in diaper bag and it's also very absorbent.  I love the adorable designs these come in-get compliments all the time!,5
468766,"My wife and I were going to an event and I needed a skinny white tie.  Every store I looked at, they were well over $25.  I only needed it this one time.  This tie worked perfectly and was well made.  The quality was great and the tie looked really good.",5
794281,This hat just sags and will not reshape. It is so unattractive. It was wadded up in a box too small for it when it arrived so that may have something to do with it. That being said though that also means it would be hard to travel with and once it's in an ugly shape apparently it stays there. There is nothing to keep the brim firm. Looks dumpy.,1
400090,"I bought this for a Mother's Day present, and my mother absolutely loved it. This little piece of jewelry is incredibly well made for such a low price tag; it's definitely more than I expected. The only problem that I had was that the pendant didn't arrive in time for Mother's Day. That's my fault because Peora is based in California, and I live on the east coast. Next time I'll make sure to order early.",4
285285,"Absolutely perfect little screw back gauges. The threads on them are good and fairly easy to screw together. I like the designs as well and the floral ones look great while I'm working in the office, no one even bats an eye over them. Great for office wear if your work policy does not like/allow gauges.",5
754677,"I bought this backpack as a gift to my husband, but now I want to buy the same one for myself! Both of us are excited of this backpack. It is good quality, light weight, suitable size for casual use with enough space inside, comfy, valuable priced, stylish unisex item. 5 stars",5
84309,It looks really good.  There seems to be some sort of magnet that makes it snap together.  The leather wears out quickly if you keep opening it and closing it.  Had it about a month.  The leather that bends the most is separating.  Still works.  Not as cool as Patrick Bateman's but it'll do for now.,4
75206,I LOVE this band! I had other bands that were not this brand that do not even compare to this one!  I like that it has the material that tightens and some what sticks to your pants to not move or roll up and down!  I will be ordering more!!,5
816976,"Band was nice but the finish wore off wishing a couple of months. Definitely not something I would recommend for an everyday wear band.

The kit was sufficient for the swap, but construction was loose and clunky. Overall the band was very nice, until around day 10.

The band started to show signs of distress and wear. By day 30, there were extreme wear marks. By day 60, I ordered a new band.",2
709466,"I was disappointed that the underwear I received was not as pictured (white with princess/castle pictures on the front.) The set that I received was very brightly colored and shows easily through light colored leggings (precisely why I wanted white.) I wish I would have known that they would be different than pictured. My daughter doesn't care though and they fit her comfortably.

UPDATE: Although I never asked, seller issued a refund after I left the above feedback. (I still need to find my daughter some white undies though.)",3
362859,I bought these as a gift for a friend and she loves them!  They are super snazzy! I haven't worn them but they seem to be pretty good quality.  The price was average.  This brand has great stuff.  I've bought Blue Q socks for a few people and they all love them.,5
3519,"Loved being wonder women for Halloween. I work at a elementary school so super hero costumes can be used often. ESP the cape. The whole costume was of good quality and the cape didn't hurt your neck as it velcroed behind your neck and had padding in the front. The leg pieces would sometimes fall down but I just pinned them to socks I was wearing underneath.
Overall I loved it and would consider buying another costume from this seller.",5
828872,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this dress! The material is a nice quality material and the fit is fun. I sized up one size based on the other reviews and thank goodness I did, or there's no way it would have zipped up. It's tighter in the bust, so keep this in mind when ordering. Even though it runs small, I gave it 5 stars due to the quality. I got TONS of compliments on it. I did get a petticoat to wear under it for our 50's theme, but it can totally be worn without it for any occasion.",5
90236,"I received the ring in a beautiful box,  right on time in regards to delivery.  It was perfect.  Just as represented.  Fit right to size, and not too big as to look gaudy.  Workmanship much better than expected for the price.  I love this companies rings.",5
743905,"Very impressed with the quality of this bag. By far passes any of the $100-200 ""brand name"" bags. Also the reason I really liked this bag (from the pictures) was the amount of dividers it had. Let me say, it has way more than the picture shows and I was beyond happy with it. It also has metal legs on the bottom so it always stands up, I love this bag!",5
870690,I love the outfit it was just a bit to small in the bust area or seemed to be. It looked just like the seller described. But in the crotch area where it fastens seemed to have some problem with the hem line sewed properly. Loose string where it was left at seam if pulled would probably cause the hem line to completely unravel. But I still like the outfit just a few minor problems I think could've been fixed easily but it appears as if it was sewed quickly.,4
449739,"I knew what size to order so I clicked on 'fit as expected'.  The first one I ordered was a bit too small.  I do think they tend to run one size small.  So, I ordered the next size up. I normally wear an XL.  The 2XL fits me very comfortably. This is the only brand of polos that I will wear.  NICE!  Lots of awesome colors, too.",5
744025,"This swimsuit is great! I love everything about it! The color (red) is not red but more a beautiful shade of hot pink. The fit is ideal, excellent bust support! and the length is perfect, covers everything I don't like to show! All at a great price! I couldn't be happier and I highly recommend it!",5
371842,"Love this top. Tight around the bust. I got a medium & I am 5'2"", 120 lbs. great international neon pink color, long enough to use as a mini dress coverup for my swimsuit.  really tight for swimming, which is actually what it's made for as well as sun block. But for wearing instead of sunblock lotion, I like it looser, will order another color only next time I will get a size large.",5
4760,"I am ordering more of these today, and was suprised to see negative reviews. So- I felt compelled to give them some positive feedback! I have never been pinched or attacked or had any other bad experience with these shapers.  On the contrary- I LOVE them.

I simply squeeze them when I put them into my boots, and then pull the hanger to get them out.  They have been very simple for me to use.

Thanks",5
239383,"This is a beautiful ring. It feels substantial and the quality is very good. I have plenty of gold and diamonds, but I love the fact that this one looks like the real thing, but I have no worries about damaging it or losing it. Seller was prompt too. Highly recommended.",5
167900,"I had previously purchased a pair of solid pants in this same brand.  For the money they were definitely worth it.  I decided to try the space print in this brand and am very disappointed.  They are very lightweight, not what you want in a yoga pant.  They do not have any compression compared to the solid color.  I would not buy the space print again.",3
561295,"As described, it fits just below the waist, but is true to size as described by the chart.  It is very light weight but extremely comfortable; long but not unmanageable.  I use it mainly for lounging around the house or for sleeping.  My only complaint is the draw string which is elastic/stretchable does not offer much help.  I'm glad I bought it and the price was right.",5
290166,I love the material and color. It looks very vibrant like the picture. It does run a little big i purchased size medium and i weigh 198lbs. Im think for the skirt i could of gotten a small. Overall i love the outfit as a dress or a two piece.,4
759417,I got this at a discount for my review I would love to of given this 5 stars the fabric is heavy and soft nicely stitched together but I ordered a medium and received an x-large and it's extremely huge on me and I can't not wear it ( 2 sizes way to big) the color was right ( Black) disappointed getting the wrong size even at a discount,3
802017,"Personally, I love this suit. YOU NEED TO ORDER ONE-TWO SIZES UP. I'm usually a medium and ordered an XL and it fit perfectly, the breast padding fit in the right spot for me, but I'm also 5'2"" and a B cup. Although, not sure how this will hold up in the water, more of a suit for tanning only.",5
387185,"This was a gift for my mother and when I showed her it in person she was ecstatic,and It looks better in person. The only negatives is the post on the earrings is really thick and the fact that the earrings are quite heavy . The ring was a one size fits all concept . The package came in early !",5
110055,"Shipping was no problem. The material is not bad stretchy, I read the reviews and took a small but I was hoping that the top fit a little more slouchy .. It didn't it actually kind if close especially with the material being so stretchy I was hoping for more of a loose fitting / slouchy fit. I'll wear it still though just not the fit I excepted and saw on the picture.",3
203265,"The first one came dirty. They sent a new one pretty quickly which was great. However after about three days the white string started to seperate from the chain. Two additional
Days the chain was completely off. Also if you have long hair do not buy the chain isn't completely sealed and snags on your hair. I had numerous hairs pulled out along with threads from my clothes from all the snagging. Poorly made.",1
809015,"This is a very soft skirt! I was actually pleasantly surprised with the quality feel of the fabric. The sizing is slightly small, but fits well and hangs nicely. The waistband is comfortable, neither too big or too small. It hit nicely on my waist. I'm 5'4"" and the skirt doesn't drag on the ground at all.

I would order this again!

I received this item at a discount for my review. Discounts do not influence my reviews and all opinions here are my own.",5
53972,"The hat completely covers her face and shoulders!  The only drawback is it is still a little large at this time, but the drawstring and ties keep it on her little head just fine.  We used it when we took the bigger kids to the amusement park for the day and she stayed shaded and comfy!",5
412382,"Jacket feels great...looks great...has lots of pockets for things like..... ""film"".  The lining feels more substantial than the overall weight of the jacket would suggest.  Should be pretty darn warm and weather resistant.  Very tactically designed.  Bought as X-mas gift for my father, who seemed really impressed.  Unfortunately... I failed to purchase one for myself.",4
397579,"After reading the reviews I thought this would be a GREAT wallet. However, when it arrived in the mail it was flimsier and the magnet didn't hold as much cash as I would have liked it to hold. Also the picture is somewhat deceiving as I thought there would be pockets on the sides to hold my cards but there were not. Only a single inside pocket is supposed to hold all the cards. It definitely is slim and if the customer is ok with the lack of pockets then I guess i'd recommend it.",2
115525,"The seam for elastic in waistband is about to break and it came that way.  Description said it was for ADULTS.  If, by adult, they mean anyone with a 22 to 24-inch waist, then Yes, it is for adults.  Took over a month to get and I would have been fine with the wait if it wasn't too small AND been poorly made.  Really disappointed.  SAVE YOUR MONEY.",1
95940,this is a cable organizer . Its a nylon fabric material used on this . You can hold 5 cables in hear with the stretchable bands inserted . the only flaw I have is the fact it doesn't get a good roll up when your ready to store it. But other then that I really recommend this if your a travler.,5
110970,"I would give it Five stars; but it was a bigger size than normal which ordered small but came it medium,overall i am happy with my robe,washed it before use as instruction says. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review. Opinions are my own",4
700070,Just got vest...came faster than expected! Ran true to size as I ordered a MED thinking it probably ran small but the small would have fit me better...there is a drawstring past hips to let in or out. Fur buttons on or off. Well made an I'm happy with purchase and the price!,4
249198,"I am 5'7"" and 165 lbs. I usually wear a US Large (10-12), so I ordered a Large even though this said Asian size large (6-8) and it fits like a long loose flowing blouse. It's not what I would wear as a dress but I absolutely love it as a blouse. Every time I wear it, I get compliments.",5
43901,"I'm satisfied with the umbrella itself, but was disappointed in the condition it arrived in. The whole thing inside and out was covered in a foggy film making it very cloudy. I was able to get it in good condition after spending about 25 min. cleaning each section at a time and then going back over it a second time but I really should not have had to do that.",3
198644,I purchased this set for my 5 year old daughter to finish off her Halloween costume.  They are well made and the beads are not the cheap plastic beads.  The necklace and bracelet have some weight to them and both have held up extremely well to the wear-n-tear they have been getting since she doesn't seem to take these off except for bath time.,5
136826,"Straight out of the box, these shoes are great! Very lightweight and fits comfortably on my feet like a glove! I love most especially that the sole is not bulky like my previous running shoes  I hated those things lol! I would give them a shot and they are great for the price!",5
718915,"I love this top! It is so flattering. I ordered a size 16 and I wore an extra large/14 prepregnancy. It fits great. Best part is I'm able to double pump without having to take off the shirt. I have it in purple and now black. The only small negative is that the tags say xxxl, when it is clearly just xl, so it doesn't make a difference only it doesn't help your self esteem to see xxxl. I cut the tag out ASAP. Problem solved.",5
52411,"I bought this hat for my son last year and loved it so much I bought another one in a larger size for him this year. It is lightweight and seems to be comfortable. It is one of the few hats he is willing to wear at all, and he wears it all day. The only drawback is that it can become a bit floppy with age and frequent washing, and then it tends to get in his eyes. Overall, it's a great hat. I wish I had one.",4
410983,"I bought this for my 13 year old daughter (size small) and it fit perfectly, not too tight or big, and the material is very nice, soft, and not flimsy at all. The quality is very sturdy and long-lasting.
However, some of the colors are different than shown. They seem to be more limited. For example, Maka's eyes and tie are blue instead of green. The skin colors are the same too. But, the colors are easy to get past and are unnoticeable. the colors are also very bright and stay vibrant after many washes.",4
405076,Overall I love the fabric on this outfit very comfortable and very sexy. I used this for halloween I just used pants because the skirt is woo hoo short. anyways the reason i gave it a three is because the gold dollar sign on the skirt is very  flimsy fell off after just one wear. and the button on it pop off very easily. Nothing a quick sew job can't fix but for 60 dollars i expect them to stay on longer than one wear.,3
375321,"Absolutely Love this,  I went camping with a group of friends and I am very uncomfortable in shorts.  I will not be caught in a bathing suit!,  I wore this and felt comfortable.  I received many compliments.  I am going to look for this in other colors ( I looked great lounging on the beach!",5
825515,"I was looking for a long skirt. I waited 2 weeks for it, way faster then expected. The material and quality are very good . This skirt would work out for not tall people. Im 58 . But the seller is very helpful. So if there is any issue they will resolve it.",4
51312,"This tummy wrap was good for around the house but impossible to wear out as it is so bulky under clothes.  I recommended my friends purchase a couple pairs of Spanx or tummy control undies before spending their money on a tummy wrap.  If I have to wear a large and bulky sweater or sweatshirt to cover the wrap, then what's the point?",2
426260,"Once you get this suit on, which can be a bit of a challenge-anybody remember girdles?- it does the job! Trims the midriff and is interesting in its asymmetrical design. Love the fact that when its untied its a decent coverup, can go from pool to beach buffet without a separate coverup. You can tie it  to reveal as much of your bottom as you want.",4
430593,"Very high quality construction, and generally very well thought out.  The only drawbacks are that the primary fold creates a central hump when unfolded (odd, but doesn't seem to matter) and the primary zipper is a single rather than a bi-directional double zipper (which would be more convenient).  I still believe this was the best bag for me, having looked at quite a few others.",5
480846,"This is a cute over jacket.  The fit was just a tiny bit tight, but not enough to categorize it as too small.  My only complaint would be that I had to put a few hand stitches alone the inside lining to keep it from showing.  I would definitely order it for as a gift for a friend, which is my highest compliment.",4
281334,"Well I was pretty satisfied with the purchase; the material looks nice, and feels nice on the skin, so no trouble there... the only issue I have with it... is there is not one tiny strip of elastic on the outfit. It has NO stretch to it. So be warned if you're a 'meatier' person, or even a guy like me. I hope you're pretty small!",3
673306,"This watch states who I am.  LOVE.  Don't love  that the band came apart; the watch stopped working.  This was my 3rd purchase (How much I love the message).  Now  after replacing the band, I just sport the message.  HELP!  I want  a REAL watch with this message.",4
553210,"Love this coat! I'm a shabby chic girl, nice boots, layered tops, muted colors and this jacket goes with almost everything. Looks great with a scarf or without just to knock around in.

268110,"This bag is such a great size.  I purchased a red one that I used while traveling in Europe for 5 weeks and it was a great purse to hold a few cards and my cash.  It was important to me that it zipped up as I wanted to be able to keep it closed and close to me in crowds.
I just purchased a 2nd black one as I use it to keep my essential items in so I can switch easily from larger purses.  Great quality!",5
137167,"Great for the price, you get the look of the real deal, quality is a little less than the real thing, but for under $7, they are good. I like that the tint is very dark like in the picture, and is pure black, no brown or purple tones like some Cheapo glasses have. Very happy!",5
41942,"I had bought this for my mom because her purse was ruined. She loves it and now carries it everytime she goes out or have an appointment. It is a nice size Purse and fits all her things in it. Such as:books,cell phone and other items. Bag is made of nice leather and with a adjustable strap.",5
277392,"First off. This shirt is gorgeous. Literally beautiful.

Unfortunately mine arrived with a little brown smudge on the front and a tear in the back arm seam.

It fits mostly to size but the way the shoulders are setup, it sits extra wide on my shoulders. I wouldn't be able to wear it with a Cami because the majority of it would show at the top.",2
427152,"My daughter wears these for dance in her tap routine. Wish someone could figure out how to make them more kid resilient. These are a good price and quality. I always order at least one extra though, little girls changing rapidly between performances can do a real number on them. I like the price for how quickly she can stick her toe through them. LOL",5
870433,"Beautiful ring! looks more expensive than it was

UPDATE:

I have had this ring for about two weeks and have only worn it maybe 6 times. The big jewel already fell out and is lost. I returned my ring and got all my money back. Wish this was made with better quality because it really was pretty.",1
489780,"These scarf's are really darling!  I've purchased several as stocking stuffers, (6-8) and haven't been disappointed yet!  Nice, chiffon weight, true clear graphics and colors.  Can't beat the price.  Shipping may be a few days longer, but it isn't out of line, and well worth the wait.",5
440882,"The color of the glasses are as described and pictured.  However, the glasses are very flimsy, plastic, and thin.  I was hoping the gasses would be really large, for an old school, hot sexy secretary look.  Instead, they are small, flimsy, and look like something you would pick up in the dollar store to let your kid play with, to quiet them down.",1
763846,It looks just like the picture...the dress is cut bluntly with no reinforced stitching so that may be a concern after some wear & washing. But we get what we pay for & I believe that this was a good buy my my pre-teen Dr. Who fan. She will eventually outgrow this anyway so I would recommend buying this to/for anyone who is interested. ,4
325367,"Fits perfectly, I am a medium US. I like this material because it produces zero lint, unlike cotton shirts that pack the air around us with very fine particles that lower our air quality, especially when indoors. The design is beautiful and this article of clothing will help one harness their Chi.

Best",5
525537,"Bought this dress, I am caught in the middle of happy and sad. I would be happy if I could get my money back. So the dress came with long sleeves, I was so looking forward to my Sleeveless dress that I order, as I live in tropical Jamaica. The quality of the material is basically what you get for this price no issue there....",1
331063,These are great gloves for very cold temps. I have small hands and have had trouble finding gloves that fit and are not too bulky. The size small is perfect and I love the zip pouch for hand warmers. It allowed me to remove one glove with my teeth while riding without worrying about the hand warmer falling out. Nice touch.,5
426031,"Larger fit in the boob area than expecting. My cup size is a D, so I was a little surprised. I just wore a padded strapless bra and it worked great. It arrived extremely wrinkled, which was annoying. The dress is super long even when I wore short heels (I am 5'11""). Be warned, after one wear a couple of the embellishments are already falling off. Nothing that can't be fixed. I absolutely love the dress though!",5
765554,"i like the tshirt very much but it was just too small. if you have one in a 3x, send me an address label and i'll mail this one back for an exchange. if you don't have a 3x then send me and address label and i will have to return it. thanks very much",4
658256,"These are good decent fleece pants.  Quality is great and fit is good except in length.  They are very long.  My husband is 6""2"" and usually buys tall pants, but these are about six inches too long.  Unless you are about 6'5"" or taller, don't get the tall.  Otherwise, these are nice pants.",4
855204,Not elbow length sleeves...closer to a cap sleeve. Ordered size 12 which is what I wear but would need a 16 in this. Tag reads 3XL which is same size of another dress I ordered from same company....same brand....but this one is way to small and other one is WAYYYY to large. Not cotton/linen....likely polyester or rayon. I'd have found it a nice buy anyway if it had fit.,3
386345,"This is a beautiful pencil skirt! I was really surprised with the quality of the fabric. It had more stretch than I expected and it's thicker so it almost feels like it's double lined. Its soft and I really liked that it's not see through at all which is great because there's no need to wear any extra annoying slips under it. The print was much more vibrant than the picture online, I'm 5'3"" and the skirt came to around mid calf. I will definitely be ordering other colors.",5
251587,I really liked this so it's a shame it wasn't sewn better.  I ordered to wear to ROTR and received yesterday.  As soon as I untied the knot to put it on I noticed the strings weren't actually sewn together and the top was unraveling already right out of the box.  Super cute though if you want to pay that much for someone and then have to sew it before you wear it.  I'm unfortunately not much of a seamtress.,1
15754,"Nice shirt for the money. Yes, you'll want to go over it with a nail clipper to pull off any lingering threads from the sewing process, but this has been the case for every shirt I've ever bought costing less than $100. Highly recommend cotton tux shirts. Odds are the activities you're participating in whilst wearing a tux are going to make polyester shirts feel like straitjackets once you work up a little sweat.

PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT: clip-on and strap-on bowties look really tacky. Please learn how to tie a bow tie, it's easier than tying a regular tie.",5
145351,"Product turned out to look more chain-ish than jewelrey-ish, but it still looks nice. I got it in black.  The problem is that the plastic loops will not stay on the glasses for anything.  One arm would fall out, or both, and my glasses ended up on the floor.  I tried to squeeze the metal end that holds the plastic loop so that it would be tighter, and when I did that the metal piece completely collapsed.  I'm not happy with it at all.",1
183920,"The item is nice, a little too puffy for my taste. Its something i could picture a jr. high girl having. The logo on the front cant be rubbed off easy and the inside is kind of cheap looking. The pockets inside to hold the cards are glued too small to hold anything and it has a slight chemical smell. I diddnt keep it, i gave it to my friend.",3
86713,"I usually wear dark clothing and have recently found that something like this dark orange and dark yellow suit my skin tone. This outfit is yet again totally my style. Allegra K is great and I'm close to ""asian size""(not your typical America) so the clothes are great for a petite skinny girl, 5'3"" 104 pounds, like me(even with a big bust).",5
812782,"I ordered a size up, and it fits perfect. For the price i was not expecting how well it is made. The front panel is thick and hides my tummy ""jiggle."" And the underwire cups give me just the right lift. Also the boy short length covers my hips just enough and gives me that cute pinup silhouette.  I don't normally write reviews but this is probably my favorite suit I've owned since having kids. I am very impressed so I thought it deserved a good review.",5
698773,"What a disappointment. The graphic on the onesie was grainy and blurry!! Obviously a poorly run homemade shop, package came from China. Also the 12 months size was way too small- would fit a newborn. AND the onesie had a strong odor, like vinegar. Was a baby shower gift, and truly disappointing.",1
717883,"This shirt is of good quality, and is semi-stretchy.  It is much smaller than the size on the label, but the sizing does somewhat specify this.  I am 5'6 and 160, and purchased a medium.  I need a large.  The snaps do not stay snapped and the sleeves are a bit short.

Please note, I did receive this product at a discounted rate for my honest, unbiased review. This has no bearing on my thoughts on the product or my likelihood to recommend to others.",3
4746,"I invested in a couple of Frye boots and wanted to make sure that I did whatever was necessary to justify the expense.  So I purchased the weatherproof ""wax"" and leather ""honey"" to help with leather maintenance.  But, guess I should have realized that, after wearing them for a while, they stretch a bit and crease.  I have to say that these don't look like much, but they get the job done.  Now the boots don't sag and I can store them standing in the closet. Definitely worth the money spent.",5
823217,"This is seriously my new favorite dress! It is super cute and it looks great on me! It is incredibly comfortable, it is easy for me to get on and off and it is actually quite warm even in the cold of winter! ^_^ I seriously couldn't be happier with my purchase. It fits perfectly, too! I also like that the bows are actually able to be moved via their use of safety pins so you can slightly alter their positioning whenever necessary or remove them completely for cleaning.",5
71220,"I purchased this dress for a friend who has twins and although they are only 5 months and in the 44th percentile for weight, they could not wear this dress. I've requested a refund from the vendor and I'm waiting to see if they will allow me to return the dresses.",4
333656,I bought this once the wire came loose the company was nice enough to replace it no hassles. But then the second one the wire came out completely but I had a bit of a hassle this time getting a refund. I decided to wait on replacing it I figured there must have been a run on defective shirts. It's too bad the shirt was lot's of fun.,3
653243,I love it but the strings are annoying. The strings get wet every time I wash dishes and I have to keep it out of my food because obviously it touches every other surface during the day. Other than that it is beautiful. The strings also get knotted up and I have to fix or become too lose and have to tighten. Not sure I'd buy again,3
181475,"This is a really cute bracelet! It took a long time to get here. The first day I wore it, it broke apart at the owl's. I just used one of the little links from the clasp to put them back together and it has been fine ever since. For the price paid, it is a nice little bracelet.",3
797237,"I really like this dress! I ordered a medium, i'm 5'3, 36 DD, 140 lbs. It is tight on the chest but obviously I am larger on top! It doesn't fit me like the model(LALA!) it hits me right under the boob. I have to wear flip flops with it because it is too short with wedges. It is super cute and great for a concert, festival, or casual night out!",4
457352,"First pair of Nike's I have purchased in many years. The rubber ""cleat"" pattern is perfect for when you can't wear hard cleats. Very light shoe too. It definitely has the signature narrow build of Nike, but the material expands to fit wide feet.  The size fits true. I usually step down on Adidas, but these fit tight at your real foot size.",5
191715,"FUNNY!
 I got these because they weren't expensive. Was going to surprise my lady for the reception. She found them in another Amazon package and then called me laughing hysterically. Getting married in Spearfish Canyon. My tuxedo is the long-sleeved fake print tux. Afterwards we're donning these and tying the cans to the bike and doing the reception at the Road house at the end of the canyon.
 If you're having a fun wedding, these will add some more. Good luck and many years of happiness!!",5
251551,"I'm on my 4th pair now, I've also been a boot guy most of my life, from the old leather mountaineering boots to now. Salomon books are the best fitting, most comfortable boots I have ever worn. Tried others now and then for fit and feel....nothing is better. They fit like a glove....and by 4th pair...i've worn them out",5
490022,I had to return the glasses because the frames were bent.  I did not receive all of my money back because I had to pay for shipping even though the glasses were defective.  I will never buy sunglasses online again.  Plus the glasses were dated 1996 on the paper in the box!!!!,1
375655,They are perfect for our 4 year old granddaughter who hated the bikini and boxer styles sold for little girls today. These are just like what my daughters wore when they were little. Now our granddaughter loves her new panties that are very comfortable. She also loves the pink hearts on the ones I ordered.,5
715767,"I bought this to wear as a band along with the stackable expressions antiqued onyx ring. These are beautiful, light, and superior quality. I wear them 24/7 in place of my wedding set and they are thin, but comfortable.  They don't turn your skin nor change color. They've held up through countless dish washings, tub scrubbings, and gardening. Highly recommend!",5
150897,I was very excited about this dress especially because of the price. Now I see why it's priced so low. The buckle around the neck popped off before I was even able to get the dress over my head. So it is going back. Too bad. The material seemed nice and it is a very cute dress.,1
240690,I was looking for a temporary wedding band because my fingers are so swollen during my pregnancy. The band is pretty and solid at a great price.  The width is perfect too.  I think anything thinner would look strange as a solo wedding band.  I'll probably get it resized and continue to wear it after baby as a keepsake.,5
724503,"I bought this dress two sizes larger than I typically wear, and it is still smaller than expected.  It fits, but I wanted it to be looser on top.  The belt is an absolute joke- it must be the same one they include with the size 10-12 dress.  If it fit as expected, this could be a flattering dress.  I doubt I'll buy another dress made by this company.",3
61211,"Absolutely beautiful!  This prayer shawl arrived promptly and in perfect condition.  Beautifully packaged.  This is a quality item and, most importantly to me, it represents a deeply sacred spiritual symbolism of all that is good and all that is pure.  The seller was so professional and so attentive to detail that I highly recommend this item.",5
810451,Product is not as described whatsoever. I bought this based on the well written description and was lead to believe it will keep you dry in light rain. I thought it would be perfect for my trip to Ireland.  I experienced a little rain that lasted 10 minutes while on a walk and the rain soaked through right away. My sweater I wore underneath was drenched. The jacket did not dry quickly. I had to hang it up in the bathroom for a while afterwards. Do not waste your money. This product is not as described.,1
283604,"Exactly what I was looking for. Great deal for the price. Excellent quality. Love the veil. (Flowers kinda cheap, but fabric is really cool with skull print) Fit perfectly. I usually wear a 10 or 12, bought the large and wore my one piece spanx so no worries with bulges or bra straps, etc. It fits snug and is low cut, but not so much that you couldn't wear it to a family party which is what I did. I bought fishnet tights and easy tattoo makeup and had the easiest to put together costume I've ever done.",5
494089,"I washed the dress and it looks fine,but when i tried to pull it out of the drawer,i don't know know what happened but one of the pearls fell off,well I guess they just glued it on. It would have been nice of they only made it better. I haven't even used it and its already falling apart.",2
459012,"The top is such good quality, heavy, opaque Tee material feels great on and shows no skin color. Though I ordered a large, and normally take an extra large for chest comfort, this large fit like a 1X and looked a bit maternity on me. So I WILL reorder in the Medium, and in multiple colors. The length was perfect, thick framed V on neck is so flattering, and the option to button sleeves up or leave them hang is a nice feature. just a solid, reliable grab and go kind of tunic style piece in my opinion.",5
468153,"This shirt is great! I got a lot of compliments when i gave it as a gift, people loved it. It's a nice hardy shirt too, its not really thin, which i hate in shirts. The graphics are done really well and don't seem to be coming off at all after the several washings its had. What a great shirt. I love mountain t's.",5
23381,I'm fairly young but started to notice the beginnings of a Tailor's bunion.  I wanted to save my feet the pain and went for this product because it was more versatile to use in boots and low-top shoes.  Works great and seems to be well constructed.  It will also be a great investment for future shoes that might be too tight.,5
234388,"I ordered a size up after reading reviews and looking at the sizing chart. Item was way too small! Could barely get it on. Quality seemed good enough for the purpose of purchase, but it was useless since it didn't fit. Then when I returned it, I was shorted $6. I would just skip buying this item.",1
385506,"Can I rate this 10 stars?  My 14 year old 6'3"" son started crying.  He said the world is so much happier in color.  He normally sees black, white, tan, yellow, and blue.  From what I can tell, he sees all the colors now.  He finally enjoys Christmas lights and fireworks.  He can't believe how much red and green exists in the world.  Thank you to whoever developed these.  I just wish they didn't look like sunglasses.  He gets snarky comments from adults about wearing sunglasses indoors.",5
823990,"I mean, I suppose this is my fault but it fit way too small. I'm usually a small and due to the fact everything seems to runs small on me I ordered a medium.
and god do I wish I had bought a large, the only thing that fit moderately well was the bottoms even though half my butt was sticking out and the top fits rather odd, lots and lots of under boob.

over all it was okay not great but okay",3
834497,"Its nice and mostly looks like the picture, just not on me. I expected it to look sexier than it was which is why I only gave it four stars. However I think for a girl who's not as flat chested as me it would look exactly like it's supposed to.",4
519998,"This skirt looks exactly like a more expensive skirt I've seen somewhere else, which it great! Amazon offers this skirt for so cheap, but it's surprisingly not very cheaply made. It fits me perfectly. I was thinking it would be a little short, but it's actually longer than most of my skirts, but not too long that it looks weird. It's cute and comfortable too.",5
633659,"Horrible!!! This dress is extremely see through and thin. Thin like a wedding veil or something. Also, I wear a large in dresses. Never a XL. 5'8ish, 34DDD, small waist, hips and butt.... After reading the reviews I ordered a XL. NO.. Not even close to fitting... XL is more like a small/medium.",1
728751,"First of all, if you plan to order this be sure you have a ball or something round to stuff inside the hat to remake the shape. It came smushed and wrinkled. It arrived the day before my husband was going to wear it, had to give it so much attention to make it look the way it was supposed to! The hat makes the outfit so I'd hope it would come in better condition. Suspenders were fine, glasses pretty small. He left them home and grabbed a pair of work sunglasses he already had.",3
733476,"You need an extra few inches to make this buckle work.  I have another belt with the same length and it has length to spare, this belt is too short for  me to latch it.  It is the length it is listed as but the buckle needs some length to get latched.",3
364395,So I read the reviews and ordered an XL because I'm 5'6 220lbs but small waist(36) However it was still too big. The top as bottom are stretchy so a smaller size would probably hold better and not be saggy. It did arrive before expected and color and pattern were exactly what was pictured. I will return for smaller size.,4
717894,This gorgeous shirt came very fast & it is a very lightweight material that is perfect for summer!! It does run on the large size. I ordered a 14 & a 10 would probably fit like I want. The 14 is just a little bigger than I wanted & I kinda look like I am wearing a tent. Otherwise it is beautiful!!,5
489665,"This a a decent wig if you want a simple, medium length brown wig.  However, it is horrible for a Hanji cosplay.  The ponytail attachment is so small and it's obvious the wig itself was never intended to be used for Hanji.  Don't bother wasting your time on this if you needed this specifically for Hanji.  Now I'm stuck with a wig I cannot use and am in search of one that will actually work.",1
67946,This purse is a good size for me and the leather is nice.  I have two complaints though.  The red die rubbed off on the top of my white pants.  Most of it came out with a wash and some Shout.  Secondly the seam in the piping came loose and a bit of white (about 1/4 inch) piping shows on top of the bag.,3
865299,"I read the reviews that said this fell apart quickly and even with the 1st use. I purchased it anyway since it had a great price, quick shipping,  and I knew I could repair it. However, it came not only coming apart, but bunched up and wrinkled as if it'd had dried in little ball. I steamed it, and will have to try to glue it while trying to re-clamp the clamp. Definitely not a ready to use without worry product. I feel badly writing negative review, but can't help that that's what happened.",1
254732,"I bought a size Med. I'm 5'2, 136 (small waist, muscular - curvy build). The padding on the top should just be pulled out, and the suit can be used for private time in the pool with your significant other. The top pushes the girls down a lot, and the sides are very tight. The back looks decent. I haven't worn it out yet.",3
182492,"This purse is extremely elegant and classy. It looks exactly like the picture on the website. The colors are bright and vibrant.  The only down fall is that it doesn't hold my IPhone 6S.
The chain wasn't  long enough for a cross body but it fits perfectly over the shoulder.",5
98248,These are fantastic. They are flattering and I truly think they help prevent fatigue. I typically wear them after I workout or on my long days at work. I totally plan on wearing these after pregnancy too. They are way easier and more comfortable to wear than the fashion compression stockings I bought for work and less expensive even. I only gave 4 stars because I think the true 5 star test would be if they last me a long time.,4
660206,"I had looked at the frame for reading glasses so I was prepared it would be small.  Upon receiving them it was very clear this is a young child, pre teen eyeglass frame.  So the description is partially correct representing the word ""ladies"" and  ""teen""  This frame is very, very small only suitable for a pre teen ages 10-13 years of age.  The description should change to state ""pre teen"".",2
693409,These are almost good. I bought size XL but they are a bit too small. The size chart indicates that they should fit well but XXL should fit nicely but they don't come in the larger size. I normally wear size M in USA sizes. I am being generous giving three stars.,3
775644,"These bags seemed thin but were adequate to do the job.  They were fine when they worked, but, unfortunately, they only held a seal about 50% of the time (or it could have been half of the bags - it was hard to keep track).  These are very similar to the much more expensive Eagle Creek compression bags we have used for years with no issue, so we know how to use and properly seal them.  Disappointing.",2
610629,"Maybe I just got lucky, but my bikini came in nearly 2 weeks before the estimated delivery date. I absolutely LOVE this bikini! It is too cute and the color is pretty spot on to the picture. It fits really well too. I'm 5' 3"" 135 pounds with a 32B bust. It's actually really flattering, even with a bit of a muffin top. I'm dying to wear this! I bought it in black as well",4
431627,Being a bargan shopper I purchased this thinking that I was getting a great deal. However I found that I was really only getting junk. I mean I didn't pay a whole lot for it but still. I had it on for the first time and with in a couple of hours it had already fallen appart. The part that holds the pearls into place are not connected very well and they don't stay together well at all,2
78224,"We love the Classic Toms but for some reason these were too big. Is that normal? I've never bought them for my 12 year old, just my younger children and have never had a problem with sizing. I still gave them 4 stars because Toms are a great casual shoe for any age.",4
687034,I'm a size 9 with quite a wide foot and bought a set of these - they slipped off pretty quick and felt a bit too small. I gave them to my partner who has smaller feet than me and she absolutely LOVES them. I would recommend the small for up to 8 to be sure that they won't slip off.,5
28619,"I have had years struggling with plantar fascia, and have bought countless inserts made by known and unknown companies.  This is the only pair that truly works for me.  I have one in all my shoes including running shoes (yes, because of this insert I can run again).  Highly recommend!",5
62938,"I received this in early May and was impressed with the size, comfort and features. This was bought as an every day bag - well this lasted for about 45 days. I just picked it up on the 46th day and the strap pulled right out of the bag on one side. You could then see how thin the leather was and how poorly the strap was attached to the purse.  Never buy this brand again.",2
83007,"These socks work!  To avoid the blisters I get when walking I've been wearing two pairs of socks which is very uncomfortable, especially in the summer.  These socks have a double layer only where it's needed on the sole and are wonderfully comfortable and lightweight.  And best of all, after a 5 mile walk I had No Blisters.",5
295939,Wish I had bought a size bigger. Not really the products fault more mine since I wasn't sure whats size I was. Love how it makes me feel but with the fabric was slightly thicker on the top. I had to take the removable cups out for fit purposes but I nip out easily. ,3
504922,"DEFINITELY RECOMMEND. It's VERY snuggly and warm, it came right on the estimated delivery date as well! Also, there was a baby kangaroo! But the baby was REALLLLLLY flat, almost like a washcloth. But that doesn't matter, I'm satisfied with my order! There WERE a lot of loose, white threads at the end though. I'm hoping it doesn't rip!!!!",5
553163,"Very nice quality shirt. I bought it for my tall/skinny 13yr old son (5'4"" and 100lbs) in a medium and it fits just a bit large, but not overwhelmingly so.  We've washed and dried it several times and the print on the front still looks great. The tshirt material is heavier than most of these novelty shirts, and the printing is very well done.",4
708743,I loved the look wish it was a little bigger but I'm a guy so it's not anyone's fault it still looks pretty I bet if your a shorter girl it would look adorable like a redneck cape I bought two of them to go with these boot heels I loved it so much I wouldn't a spare incase it gets stained,5
116060,"Well for the first look the costume was fine, but them the day that I had to use I notice that this costume wasn't brand new, it had a lot of marks of make up, food and drinks on it ! For the price it's ok but I wish they put in there that this costume is used and not band new.. It fits ok the shirt was too big and the skirt was fine . I ordered M size ! The shipping was fast.",2
804514,"I'm giving this 4 stars because of how the breast area fits (it's loose in the band). For reference, I am 230lbs, 5'8"" and my hip size is about 50 inches or so. The fit is very flattering for plus size women and I would def recommend. The price point is very attractive as well",4
238052,"Very cute top with Stretchy Jeans.  The sleeves are boarding on being to short though so if you have long arms like I do than you might not want to put this in the dryer.  Lovely quality and glad that I bought three different colors in this.  This was packaged perfectly and delivered rather fast.  I would suggest to anyone that is looking for something in between causal and dressy than this is the top.

I am 5'5 weighing 149 pounds, so hopefully this will help you.",5
68052,"Love how soft this hat is and appreciate that the interior is lined in even softer jersey with finished seams.  Definitely is on the smaller side, which was nice because so many hats were too big at first, but also means that it will be outgrown quickly.

397417,"My son has had this hat for over a year and it still looks great.  It took a while for him to grow into it (I got it for him when he was only 6 months old).  He's been wearing it for a year now and it's super cute.  My husband loves the Cards, so he's thrilled for our son to have this cap.  The little-kid writing on it is cute; I just wish it had the Cardinals logo somewhere on it.  Overall, very sturdy, and it seems comfortable for my son.",4
281825,"I love these pants. I bought these in the khaki color and loved them so much I came back and bought the burgundy color. I am short (5'1) so the capris fit me perfectly for regular skinny or ""ankle"" length pants. I did this on purpose because regular length pants are always way too long. They fit true to size and they're so comfortable but nice enough that I can wear them to work with a long shirt. Probably getting more colors soon!",5
441167,"Great, match perfectly my top. Its a bit large and long for me im. 5'5 and i step on the bottom, i ordered xl cause i read that the run perfect to size and i don't like to wear too tight clothes for work, im a 12 im getting large nect time, love the pockets and elastic on the back. Very flattering.",4
346605,"Love these.  I have Raynauds and need a glove I can wear inside to keep fingers warm and use my touch screens and I finally found a glove that works.  I would give it 5 stars, except my fingers are short, so the gloves are just a little long in the fingers.  My hand is 6 1/4"" long and 3"" wide across the palm and the gloves do not need to stretch for me.  So bigger hands should have plenty of room.  They might be too big for smaller hands.",4

Did I mention how much I love this belt!",5

I didn't need the same number of each color, but i was looking for a variety of colors.... Nope, just all blue.  Ugh....they need to clairfy that the items will all be one color.  Very, very disappointed!",1
866457,"This is a great quality pre-tied option! I had ordered from a few different stores and loved this one for my wedding party, so if you're in limbo, look no further. Not overly shiny and cheap looking, it's a smooth finish without being completely matte. So if you want to look extra fancy, this is the best option.",5
246014,"Received my top before expected so that was a plus. I couldn't argue the price. The top actually has padding (removable) and strings to adjust and tie accordingly. My only issue with the top is I'm a 34C and have quite a bit of side boob exposed. I'm totally OK with it though. Perhaps I'll just put a flash tattoo on my side boob for the world to see! Great top for a day out at the beach, on a boat, or if I feel brave enough at a festival. We'll see, either way I'm excited to wear this out.",4

204976,"The fit is nice. It hugs your body, providing you have curves to hug. The top is a little see thru. The bottom isn't so much as long as you were appropriate color under garments. The color is more of a pumpkin orange compared to what's displayed on the picture.",3
621944,I love this top it is quite lovely and can dress up a black dress to a pair of jeans If you have large forearms I think it will be to tight for you. he slits for the arms are for petite girls however the rest of the top is quite roomy.,5
238212,The earrings themselves are beautiful. Only problem is that the backs (all 6) do not have holes!! I am keeping them because they have great color and shine. I am having to use rose gold backs from other earrings I own. Disappointing. Like to keep earrings and their backings together.,2
434079,"I initially ordered the Small, according to their size chart, it should have fit. Too short. Im 5'6"" and 123lbs. (which stated should fit me)The bottom of the leggins came up to my middle calf, and the thats with them pulled up all the way, the crotch still was not where it belongs. So I ordered a Medium. And the zipper on the L leg went right over my knee cap(ouch), shouldve been on the thigh, so I sent both back. Poor material contruction and innacurrate sizing.",1
44700,"These boots are absolutely beautiful, but quite narrow and thus were too small for me.  I contacted the seller and they were highly responsive and I was able to return the product easily and they were quite courteous.  I would recommend this seller to anyone, but order these in a size smaller unless you have very narrow feet.",3
648529,"I love these tote bags. They're perfect for my coloring book supplies when travelling. Nice and sturdy, with plenty of room for a book, a case of pencils and my pastels. The front zipper is a great bonus because I can put extra pencils, pens, a manual sharpener, craft knife, etc. Highly recommended.",5

I can tell this shirt won't last long.  I washed inside out, but that obviously didn't help.  I guess I'll handwash from now on to preserve longer.  Bought as a gift for my daughter.",3
384679,"Contrary to some of the poor reviews I've read here, I find this wallet to be an excellent value. Stitching is uniform. It is made of synthetic leather. Overall good quality. I particularly like the zippered center pocket. Have been using it daily for a month now and it still looks like it is brand new. I see no reason to pay more for a front pocket wallet. I'm not so sure of the RFID blocking marketing claims, but I didn't buy it for that capability anyway. I'm not sure any of the RFID-blocking wallets really work.",5
741225,"Love this sweatshirt, very warm and cozy! Please pay attention to the size measurements before ordering!!! I usually wear a S/M in tops...but after I looked at all the measurements for this sweater I ordered an XL...and it fit perfectly.

Youd be better off wasting money on something else. It was even fitting and hung extremly loose and i bought the smallest size available!! Im only 5'9 and 140 pounds.,1
828124,"This is a decent watch for the price I paid (which is around $4.50). However, the star deduction is that it's not an automatic watch (I wouldn't expect it to be at this price point) or a mechanical one.

It is a quartz watch. The bands are PU, as you would expect.",4
64953,"I bought this bracelet for my wife for our 11th anniversary (stainless steel) and she has been very pleased with it and receives complements on it frequently. I had read the review that said it was too small and too difficult to adjust, but thought I'd give it a try since it was such a great price. True enough, it is a substantial amount of steel to have to bend, but it can be done (my wife adjusted it herself) and well worth it. We are very pleased with this bracelet.",5
601847,"The flow and lengh are great but sleeves are a little tight.  The material in real life does not reflect the material in the picture.  The picture makes you believe it's the worn look but it's not.. just straight white.

364825,These are really only wearable with jeans because of the design. Hard to explain but basically the end of the pad is sort of detectable and leaves a little gap between it and where your booty and thigh meet. It looks a little unnatural with leggings or seamless clothing because of that. These are also very small. Will be on the hunt for a more comfortable pair to wear with all my clothes.,3
686001,"Words cannot express how much I love this necklace. It came with two chains. One is a rather long metal chain; and the other is leather. It came with several little wool balls and two glow in the dark balls. One is green, the other is blue. These balls (all except for the glow in the dark ones) allow you to add drops of your favorite essential oils or perfumes onto them and insert them into the necklace. You then just wear it around. Not only does it smell nice; it is beautiful. I highly recommend this high quality necklace.",5
286573,Cool Item.  I have 8 gshock solar watches.  Every now and then i would line them up on a table in my yard to charge.  it worked but living in Arizona the sun can be brutal and I wasn't comfortable with having the watches get hot.  The is a perfect solution.,5

423704,"This ring is a great buy!  I've gotten nothing but compliments on it, and after six months of wear, it's still in perfect condition.  The design of the ring allows for the rose gold plating to be protected, so mine is still in perfect condition.  The only other thing I will say about it is that the tungsten is a shade darker in real life than in the picture.  Also, it has more of a matte texture to it than you'd expect.  Other than that, it's great!",5
489227,I've got to admit that this product surprised me.  I was expecting a hoodie that I could wear under my polar-fleece jacket.  This jacket isn't going to be worn under anything -- it's heavy-duty and winter-ready.  It fits snugly around the cuffs and waist band so cold winds can't get inside.  This is now my go-to winter jacket.  The polar-fleece can stay in the closet.,5

Fits as expected with plenty of adjustment as a snapback.",3
649205,"I ordered a large, which I assumed would be equivalent to a size 14 - 16, but it's unbelievably too small.  It fits like a size 6 - 8.  There are no tags or stamp on it stating the size, so I don't know if they sent me the wrong size or if it's a child's large.",1
877482,"The leggings are extremely cute. Unfortunately they are also quite see through. It might have been alleviated if I purchased a large? I'm 5'3 and 135lbs, 32"" waist and 40"" hips.

I really want the tummy control so I like wearing the high-waisted leggings but these have a tendency to roll down in the waist when weight lifting. It's probably not an issue if you fold it down, though I didn't try.

Overall they are good for the price. I might try a size large in the future to see if I'm happier with that fit.",4
63524,"Bought this for a 21 yo for her birthday, who is an avid WW fan.  She wears a sz 8 but that was too big.  Returned it and this fits perfectly.  She has worn it around the house before and AFTER Halloween.  It is well made and what a GREAT price. No hassle returns too.",5

It came with a tool to aid installation, wasn't expecting that little bonus.  The design is hardly revolutionary but just works and looks great.  I haven't even lost any hair which I commonly do with metal bands.  It would not be unreasonable for this band to sell for three times the price.  Simply a great value.",5

Only wear this if you have no chance of it getting caught on anything.",2

Was so tight on my calves was cutting off circulation from the few seconds I had it on, Im only 5""4 and the top part would not even come up and cover my chest and it was skin tight from the bottom to the top.

I actually first bought it hoping I could use it as a sports bra (I'm a size B) but it's not quite supportive enough for intense active movements. Wasn't disappointed, however, since I now use it as if it were a normal bra with open back shirts. It's comfy and there's thin padding to prevent embarrassing chilly nips.

558075,"These are cute, but they have design flaws that make them pretty useless to keep a kid's hards warm. Mainly the string connecting in the middle of the outside of the mitten means that they get pulled off easily, and you can't tuck them over sleeves to help them stay on, which I often try to do. If the string connected to the inside of the mitten, and was longer, they might be a little better. Also, not very thick. Lots of cold hands.",2
731782,Hate these bottoms. They constantly loosen. They just have a string in between holes to hold on. You better have a Brazilian to wear this other wise in shaving is not good enough not even a liner in crotch. Worst purchase I have ever made and forget about dealing with return.,1

535721,"I only gave it 4 stars because, come on', it's an under $5 set. You can tell its costume. But that being said, it's nicer than I expected and the colors are extremely vibrant. It's not going to last a lifetime but it'll be great for the season. Would definitely purchase more like it.",4
1942,"We bought this for our (small-for-his-age) 4 year old for Halloween. It was a little heavy for him.  He only wore it during our trip to the Target for their pre-Halloween in-store event. He was the talk of the store.

This fits onto an adult. The talking inside the helmet is not too loud. The edge of the stickers started peeling off the outside of the helmet within the first day but could probably be fixed with a dot of super-fast drying glue.

Overall we are really happy with the purchase.",5
218939,"I purchased this as a gift for my Mother. I am an only child and my Mom is a single parent, so I chose this charm which reminded me of a mother & child together. It's heavy, beautiful, high-quality & includes a beautiful necklace. My Mom loved it, posted the attached photo to her Facebook, and got about 200 compliments on the necklace. For the price, it's a win-win to give as a gift. It's affordable on the wallet while looking like an expensive jewelry store item. I highly recommend!",5

Unfortunately for me it appears I have received another, $39+, blemished hat. The first one was stolen, when my car was broken into. I placed the order for this hat two days later. Both show/showed damage to the brim, that was spot painted, an then entire hat was painted. .

I've washed it probably about 30 times and no fading so far. It does have pads in it, but they don't line up with my breasts, lol. But it doesn't both me. I really like that it is as cute as a light bra, but is strong enough to run in.",5

Also, the neck is way wider than expected and it was a little smaller than expected as well. I would have returned simply because I didn't like the overall image on the shirt, I didn't like the shape of the neckline, and the sweatshirt is smaller than I would have expected for a medium.",3

Update**To my surprise, they never fell off! Changing my rating to a 4 since they do work but still seem a but loose at the ankle.",4
761197,"Super cute shirt. The material is even better than it appears in the picture. However, the picture makes the shirt look longer than it actually is. In the front, the shirt is a little too short for my taste. Given, it is a crop top, so if you're looking for a super cute, short crop top, that looks somewhat classy, I recommend this purchase!",4

There are no examples of how to wrap the top portion around your body either, I had to look it up on youtube. I was unsure of how to even put it on. I am very disappointed with this.",2
114024,Fits fine but the only thing is the pocket are makes it look sort of bulky in that are. I prefer to wear leggings underneath as this may be too short to pull off as a dress (for me). But a good look overall. Maybe if i had a little more boobs,4

I currently wear a size 2. The medium was fine but small would have been better. Either way great costume. I suggest wearing your own black leggings as the material on the ones that come with the outfit are fairly poor quality. All in all so glad I purchased this.",5

347284,"Dress came really fast! The color and shape was as expected, I ordered a medium, I can normally wear a medium or small in dresses but wanted to make sure it fit since sequins usually don't stretch...I wish it fit a little more snug as I was expecting a very form fitting dress. Overall I'm very happy with my purchase and this will for sure be my new years dress :)",4
192886,"It fits perfectly, and thankfully both ends unscrew so you can put them on a different barbell if you need a longer or shorter bar. I've already gotten comments on it, from ""You have as arrow through your ear"" to ""I love your arrow piercing"" definitely recommend it's a great conversation piece!",5
654892,This was a cheap production of the picture-nothing like the picture though.  It's way too short and nearly sheer.  I will have to wear it as a cover up.  I would not buy from this vendor again nor would I recommend to anyone I know to purchase clothing items from them.,1

It seems sturdy and well made except the clasp is a knot that must go through a hole that is too tight for her little fingers to manage.
That will be easily remedies with some Velcro.",5
504393,"Cheap, very low quality. I received mine and it was slightly dirty, almost like it had already been used a couple of times. I returned it immediately.

Also, the zipper to the main clothing compartment doesn't go all the way up- there's a big gap with a triangular flap that comes down to sort of cover the clothing from inside. There's really nothing keeping the clothes protected. Don't buy this bag.",1

Conclusion: This product is a diamond in the rough. A+++++",5

Basically wait til just after you showered, to make your lobes more elastic, use emu oil to make the transition a wee smoother. All I want to know is why is it so much significantly bigger for a 1mm raise??!",3

Edit - My daughter is almost at the 6 month mark with this and it's still holding up well. It's been thrown in the corner, the back of the car, dropped in many different places and it's still kicking.",4
138857,I give 5 stars for appearance and 1 star for fit. They are great looking but extremely small and almost impossible to attach without help from a small fingered person. Don't let the pics fool you. They are about the size that would fit an undeveloped 12-year old kid on a cold day. So I gave them 3 stars.,3

My engagement ring and wedding bands are all soldered together so I love that I can keep this band on all the time and slide my larger diamond bands on with it when I want to.

The charm was too big/the bar was too long/my ear is too small, that I, unfortunately, couldn't get the bar to fit in my ear. I was really disappointed that it wouldn't fit, but it is a super cute earring for those who have a piercing where it will fit!",3

If I put the hat on my head level the bill completely blocks my vision. The body of the hat is on the back of my head touching my neck when the bill is level.

In addition to being everything it was advertised as (and visually shown to be prior to purchase), the ring when it arrived has a more solid feel than l expected (for being a 5 mm band width), as well as a quality, ""silky"" feel to it.

My little dog liked them too though, and showed me how much by chewing through the strap on one making it impossible to wear them. I did get to wear them about a half hour before the disaster. I wish they made flip flops that would taste nasty to dogs so they'd leave them alone. I did try to put them out of reach, but it didn't work.",5

One it runs a bit small so I would suggest ordering one size larger, two it is very thin so I have to wear a tank under it which is very uncomfortable for a bodysuit top. It is soft and looks nice but I don't wear it that often due to it being so thin. I don't always want to have to wear that many clothes in order to wear this top.",3

79857,I have a hard time finding nice clothes in my size that are truly beautiful and fun. The dress fit me perfectly compared to their sizing charts. This is the second of three item I have bought from this store and I CAN'T WAIT to order again and again. I am in love :),5
310225,"My daughter refuses to chew on anything besides her hands. She won't take pacifiers or toys. Without mittens, she scratches up her mouth. Regardless of how short her nails are. These mittens are a lifesaver!! She can't get them off and she can chew on them to her hearts content. I'm not sure how parents with picky babies can survive without them. I will use these for all future babies and recommend them to mommies everywhere until my throat is sore from speaking. These are beyond awesome.",5
151702,"On a positive note, this item was extremely low priced, so you are not out much.  However, it was extremely large and does not appear to look like the photo when you put it on.  The material is very sheer.  The neck line is not as wide as it appears.  If you have tailoring skills you can probably make something out of this, but otherwise when you wear it you  appear to have a ton of sheer fabric draped across your body.",1
799254,"Fit is fairly large but it may be the style of extra flowy...? The material is good for water, but was a little odd at first when I took it out of the box. Overall, it is really cute, comfortable and looks just like the picture. I would order again but in a smaller size.",4
343652,"Perfect, nice,  compact wallet.  I have 7 cards in the wallet.  Debit, credit,  and rewards cards.  Probably no more cause it's a little tight with that many,  but it should loosen up with use.  License fits right in the window pocket.  I even added a 5 pocket wallet insert for pictures. Good construction and the patch of the vault boy is sewed on not glued so it's holding up remarkably well.",5
749457,"Great service. Came a day early. The only thing I don't like is that the taper is longer than I expected it to be, but it is light. If you are planning to sleep with these in for a night to let your ears get used to the 0g size, then later put the plugs in, just be careful which position you sleep in. Otherwise, this product is awesome",4

782791,"The orange is very bright....but fun! The image is nice, although it don't think faded mickey looks that great on bright orange. I thought the sleeves were too big, and the waist too narrow. But it wasn't bad. I still wore it during our vacation :) I also ordered a green shirt which I liked better. It was a softer material, better fit and I liked the mickey design better.",3
237277,I LOVE IT!!!!!!! It came fast and it's sooooo soft. I was kind of scared to buy it thinking I'd look fat and awkward in it but I bought it anyways and I love how its extra big. The advertisement picture makes it look like it would feel like felt but it's so so soft. Very happy with this and would definitely buy another in the future,5
834888,"I was so excited when I saw this because I LOVE CATS!!!!  This shirt made me smile as soon as I looked at it!  I love the shirt....very cute and fun!  FYI it is jersey material which is nice in the summer.  Shirt is nicely made, but it is small.  I know it shows men and women wearing the same shirt, but truly you must be a small built to wear it.  Wish they had size options.

 I received this discounted for my honest review.",3
226569,"So I bought  this thinking that it was a great price for this necklace, but it's not. You pay for what you get and this is cheap. This necklace looks like something you get at the dollar store. Also, it takes a long time to ship because it's coming from china.",1
136439,"I am totally in love with this top. I was scared because of the asian sizes thing and I am no small woman, however I read the reviews and decided to go with the large one. I have zero regrets! It fits perfect! I am super happy with my purchase!",5
417430,"The Shoes fit nicely and look great, although they may seem to shiny at first. Performance wise it is good, but feels a bit too grippy as if there is too much rubber used, but the overall materials are well made making it a great shoe, i've used them for 2 years now when playing with my indoor soccer leagues and so far no major complaints. Just be prepared to possibly buy another pair of laces as these ones are not really up to par with your expected sport shoe laces.",5
318172,I love the style and pattern of this. I ordered x large because that was the only one on prime and it fit right. Normally I wear a medium though and I expected this to be bigger to wear with leggings but this fits snugly but comfortable. I do love it though (:,4
682227,"I really like this shirt.  My hesitation which keeps me from giving it 5-stars is that it is slightly static-y and on dry days, I can't get the static to go away.  That said, I like the color, feel, shape, fit...

It's a sheer material, but not see-through.  Don't ask me how, but even my white bra can't be seen underneath this navy-blue top.  The nice thing about this is that it's super breathable, which is great on a hot day!",4
503808,"I bought this so that my boyfriend would have something to show off to his buddies in choir and boy did it score him some points! They were so jealous! It fit great, came at the perfect time, and after a year it has lasted! I'm sorry for such a late review but this was great! Definitely buy it!",5

97792,"This shirt took a long time to ship (about a month).  And it was NOT what I was expecting after reading other reviews.  The craftsmanship of this shirt is horrible. The seams are NOT sewn straight, the material is itchy and there wasn't a reciept or a way to return the garment.  I will NOT buy anything more from Allegra K!  Waste of my money, I won't wear this, and I have no way to return it.",2
278072,"It looked like it was put together by a kindergartner. Lace was not completely attached. The lace appliques were not cut out following the lace pattern so there was extra material that was out of place and looked ridiculous. The color is white, not White Ivory. You definitely get what you pay for on this one. Trust me, you will be disappointed in this veil and I would strongly urge you to look elsewhere.",1
41973,"The purse is perfect.  I know that some people considered it small, I usually only carry a tiny bag.  But I can get my kindle, wallet, cell phone, hearing aid holder, eye glasses and sun glasses in here no problem.  Now I just have to get organized so I can find everything.",5

Update:  After reading my review the seller refunded my money in full.  Potential buyers should be aware that these leggings should have been marketed as tights or hosiery, not leggings.  As they are priced in the stocking/tight range, anyway,  buyer expectation would be better managed.",2
30978,I returned this product and did not receive credit for them. I returned a grey pair and the navy pair in same box. Only got credit for 1 pant. Theses run very big. Husband didn't even try them on. Pants looked like clown pants just when holding them up. Would really like my credit for my return . It was approved but no credit ever received. Not happy.,1
548126,"it's not stylish but it is thin enough to fold and carry in a coat pocket but enough to do a good job of keeping your head and ears warm.  it is a little thin, so at times i pull up a hood over it.  i have a large head but it is stretchy enough to fit.",5
99810,"This review is the same as the first one, I bought two handbags by Scarleton and one is just as good as the other one, I'm pleased.

I opened up the package just to find that it was all tangled up, and it could have easily taken me 30 minutes to untangle it. One chain was actually broken when it got to my house. This is nothing like it looks in the photo.",1
70108,"Item looks like the photo. It's also soft. I bought this as part of a costume for my large-sized dog, but it would obviously fit a child too. I think it is too small to fit a teen or adult. The only con with this crown is that it would be a bit difficult to keep it on unless you attached a piece of elastic to it or used some clips.",4
747247,"great shirt i have 4 more of these in grey black and red and love them very flattering and versatile . this one gingham shirt is more nylony than my other ones. perhaps its just a thing thats happening in current fashion?  this is the second shirt I've gotten that i would not have purchased if i had the opportunity to feel the fabric first. very much like bathing suit material. great shirt, adorable, feels gross on my skin.",4
114130,"Overall, pretty nice.
Good Quality. True to colors shown online.

I wish it held more. There are 4 slots to store cards or money.. But with more than 2 cards it is nearly impossible to close since the clip is magnetic and doesn't stay closed.  So for that , its alright.  Wish i would have purchased one with a button clip instead of magnetic or  if it held a little more stuff.",3
75434,"Very happy with this product. I wear a size 18/20 and the size 4 is perfect fitting. I will wear often with my jeans, very comfortable! You can fold it over or wear it stretched all the way up your belly. Keeps pants up & just looks like a long undershirt. Highly recommend.",5
217271,"This a great hat for keeping you in the shade. I live in south FL and its very hot down here in the summer especially if the sun is out and blaring. The hat is 100% functional and keeps your head and shoulders in the shade. The quality is great and the fabric around the edges does a good job of protecting the straw from bumps such as door edges.

Great product.",5

Initially I thought it could and should be cheaper since it's just sock. But now I think the price is reasonable, because of the high quality and its duriablity.
Before I saw the review that there is uncomfortable rub on the back with shoes. But I feel nothing. The elastic is just fine as well.
At the beginning, u might not feel adapted with the toes. But later you do.",5
269186,"This is a great value for the price. I needed something to keep me from slipping while holding my yoga poses and these really help. I do notice my hands slip inside the gloves, not awful though, and that's better than slipping 2 feet off my yoga mat :) The material is a little thicker than their yoga socks so my hands get a little warm but nothing unbearable. Really can't beat the price for 4 sets of gloves!",4
758367,I bought this T-Shirt in 2 colors by Women Within as a blind purchase in that I've never ordered from this retailer before.  I'm pleased with my purchase.  The colors and fit are both as expected and the t-shirts are soft and comfy.  I will consider ordering again in the future as need arises.,5

415832,"These are way cuter and more affordable than other cat woman ears, BUT they are VERY tight. I scored the ends of them with an xacto knife and snapped off about an inch on each end, then melted the ends to make them smooth, so it wasn't digging into my head. I also pinned down the ears to my hair with bobby pins, and it stayed on the entire night with no retouching. I would recommend these.",4
393888,"I am really enjoying these sunglasses.  They fit well, the advertised picture and product match well, and it is a great price in my opinion.  I really like the case too; it has more structure than just a cloth envelope but doesn't take up space like a hard case would.",5

332464,Like many others.. I received my veil you definitely get what you pay for. I bought this specifically for pictures not the actual ceremony. The veil had not been trimmed so there is about an inch between the design and the edge. The comb is on backwards. And finally the veil was not wide enough it was roughly 30 inches in width. I will definitely be having  to get crafty.,3

824632,"I'm between a 4 and a 6 (5'7"" 135) and this suit, while snug, fits nicely. The bottoms are perfect but the top is a tad bit tight. Then again, I have a slightly larger chest. I can imagine that if you got bottoms that were too big they would feel weird since the fabric is quite thick, but for me they fit great. Got a ton of compliments at the pool and it looked amazing with my sheer black fringe cover up and sun hat. I felt like a gothy goddess. <3",4
116384,"It came with a small hole in it but it was so cheap that I didn't bother to send it back. I love the style but the fabric is a little stiff and doesn't stretch real well so when you have the sleeves pulled up like in the picture, it leaves a red mark.",3
251755,Absolutely LOVE it!! My 5 year old lives it!! We had to go find an indoor pool for her to try it out! But you do need to buy a monofin to put in it to swim in it. That's about another 50 bucks. But really love the piece!! Beautiful!,5
222211,"This ""Buckle Rage Bullets Amo Removable Lighter Belt Buckle"" is not very practical as a belt buckle or lighter, although it is perfectly functional in both capacities. My son works in a gun shop and also collects lighters, so this was the ideal ""gag"" gift for his birthday and he loved it.

This is pretty big and the top is pointy (as expected) which can make it uncomfortable to wear. It is also not the highest quality, but does look like what it is supposed to look like.

Recommended!

These added features made a big difference to her and consequently she uses this handbag often. I'm glad I was able to give it to her.",5
444712,"Super cute, and fit well for a couple hours, but then the elastic on the bottom stretches a bit, and they want to ride up on my foot.  I kind of wish they had a small toe loop to hold them in place.  A novelty, but probably wouldnt use for everyday.",3

My sister is a SMALL normally and sometimes an XTRA Small, I had to give the item to her!  The bottoms were still small on her and they were larges!

I am very disappointed in this purchase!",1

The material is not knit but like a screen overlay graphic....I wore it when I went out, and it was bodycon, but I don't know. I don't know if I'd wear it again. Something to think about...If it's cheap, there is a reason.",3

They're not meant to be flattering but rather super soft and airy with funny pictures and quotes. Overall, I will keep buying for sleeping shorts/boxers!",5

749795,"Bought scrub sets for my husband.  He is being treated for cancer and finds scrubs comfortable for the treatment session.  I thought there was some elastic in the waist along with the drawstring, but, it was all drawstring.  He could comfortably fit in a medium-but asked for large to ensure comfort.  They're just a little too large--but, not the fault of the company.  Again, thank you Amazon for having everything I need.",4
692013,"The pouch is poorly designed. I wore these all day to see if the pouch would come undone, after walking for a few minutes the pouch would come loose and as you can guess no support at all. These would be great as fun in the bed but not something to wear all day",2
589512,I order a medium and it fits great.except for the sleeves. They are a tad to short for me. But then again I have long arms but other wise it's a beautiful sweater nice and warm and colors are great I love sweaters like this and this one is my favorite out of the 5 I have,4
184889,"I wanted a big purse. But this purse is ridiculously, unnecessarily, embarrassingly huge! It's a great quality. I love the color. It's just WAY bigger than I ever anticipated. And I read all the reviews about it. If you are looking for a monster of a bag, this is it.",4
518699,"My husband likes short boxers but most of the ones we get are too loose on the legs; however, these fit perfectly. Another problem he sometimes had with the loose leg is that he doesn't feel secure in the brief. First thing he said to me when we were getting ready for bed was that his equipment stayed in place even though he was moderately active all day. He loves these. Will absolutely get them again.",5
635299,"Very cute, but runs small, should order a size larger. Also, the shipping got messed up and it took more than 2 MONTHS for me to receive this item. I did receive a $5 refund because it took so long to ship, but it ended up being too small so it was still disappointing.",2
287449,This is beatiful! My only complaint is that the stitching is very very sloppy. I had to trim a lot of hanging threads and when I wear it I hope I'm not around anyone who is going to look too closely or you can tell that it's cheaply made. Good choice on print though!,3
531431,"It doesn't look like the one in the picture. it has too layers, one short and another long, so it looks sheer from the knee down. It doesn't have nearlt as much fabric as it looks on the picture. looks cheap. I ended up cutting the second layer and transforming it into a mini skirt",2
511557,"This bag is stunning. As always with these types of bags, I wish it was a little bigger. I bought it to go with a cranberry lace dress and it looked perfect. The dress, I ended up not wearing and I sadly sent back this bag.  I went with another bag by this this same company with a different dress and received many compliments.",4

The case is beautiful, however, it is easy to bend out of shape after I dropped the phone and the small hooks on the top and bottom now do not clasp as well.  They pop open from time to time which is annoying... I may order the case again just because I love the flexibility of using it as a mirror.",3
787473,"Love love love this suit! So flattering. I'm 5'6 165 lbs. I ordered the 3xl size. Very happy with the fit of the top, though I did remove the bra pads as they didn't fit my body properly. The top is longer on me than appears on the model in the picture. The pants are not as tight as they probably should be but comfortable and look fine. Overall very happy. Very chic suit!",4
450206,"This is a great option for a bride with a low back dress.  I ordered a size C as that is what I normally wear. The cups are definitely too small, but with the right dress it will work fine. I am keeping mine because it works fine with my dress but for anyone else, be warned it fits a bit small so size up.",4
63712,"the dress itself is very nice, even though it's very ""nylonish"".
I had an issue with the size (I'm 5'7 and 155p): cap is too small, arm gauntlets are too tight, the dress itself is too big in chest (mine is 36C). you need to be at least 36E or DD to make a good fit.
the corset part of the dress (I guess due to the lack of bubs) was sitting ""chubby"" on me.

but, if you can manage with the size, the costume is quite good.",3
741549,"This top is elegant, yet still can be worn as everyday wear depending on what you put with it. I am 5' 3"" about 170lbs and the xl fit perfect. It flowed much like the picture. I love this top and wish it came in other colors. I wore it to a party and stayed comfortable all night so the fabric gave the perfect amount of warmth but wasn't too hot. Maybe this will help someone make a decision.",5
288013,"(Lace 2) I have mixed emotions on this top. There's is no question that It looks fabulous on! I had lots of compliments everywhere I went wearing it. However, the stitching is pooringly done and I had to resew. The lace was coming off after once use and so was the collar. But I fixed it and we're back in business. I am 5'6"" 125lbs and ordered a small. The top is flowy and ends 5"" from my knees. Like I said it looks great on as long as you can sew to mend the pieces.",3

This vest does it's job well whether standing, walking, sitting or bending.  I found no less than 5 inspection stickers on the garment which indicates to me that the manufacturer takes great pride in their product.  Aside from the wonderful support it provides, I also think I look sexier. (I certainly feel sexier.)  I highly recommend this Vest and plan to purchase other Vedette products.",5
463293,"This is the cutest costume. It is so much better then buying one that is in a plastic bag. The material is thick and looks just like the picture. Warning though it is short. I wore it out with some nude leggings but if you are looking for something for work you will defiantly need to find a way to lengthen it, well depending on your work that is :) I also bought the vulcan ears and wore a black wig with black boots and it was a hit!",5
311014,I really hoped my kid who hates mittens would like to try gloves but these are just impossible to get all 5 fingers in.  Even if you have the most docile kid on the planet (not likely if you're trying gloves instead of mittens) the liner just makes it too hard to shove the fingers in.,1
66329,Okay well I'm kinda disappointed because I wanted 100 tongue rings and they only gave me 84 and there were some duplicates but any duplicates I had I gave them to my best friend because she has hers done too but it kind of made me mad that I only got 84 when it says 100 but I do still have a lot and they will last me awhile,2

I have received several comments on how nice it looks. The shipping was also very reasonable and it arrived in the expected time frame. I would definitely order from this seller again and would recommend them to my family and friends.,5

I did find the brief underneath to be too snug in the leg openings. Almost perfect, but not quite.  The search continues.",3
739480,"Although it looked good on, it did not feel good at all.  Not only is the material very cheap (i.e., very thin and scratchy - not at all smooth-feeling), but the design of the pants was tight on the lower half of legs and not attractive on the top part.",2
609400,"I was so excited to order this dress. It looked amazing in the photos on amazon and other reviews did not scare me away. However, when I got it I was so disgusted. Material was cheap. Choker kept coming out of the loops which made it hard to get on. Once it was finally on I just felt so utterly unimpressed. Dress was way long. Made me look 5 months pregnant the way it fell on my stomach. Ended up returning it for a full refund.",1
12122,I really do like the powerstep insoles but I really don't see a difference between them and the Quickstrides that I get from my Podiatrist except that I have to pay more for these because they are not covered by my insurance. If you don't have insurance definitely buy these over the Quickstrides as without insurance they are much more affordable and are just as supportive.,4
421534,"This a very stylish and handsome hat for ladies too.  I've always loved men's hats, they fit my face better.  I receive lots of compliments when I where it.  If they offer it in brown in the future I will be buying it immediately.  Love it.",5
679781,"I love this skirt! It's stylish and weighs almost nothing so it's great item to pack and go off for the weekend. It maintains its shape after hours of wear and a quick hand wash and drip dry makes it ready to wear again with no effort. I got a small, 125#s/5.6"" tall, and the fit is perfect. Also, the length is great for me, just above my knees.",5
17633,I recieved these rings a couple of days ago and really love them. They have alot of sparkle and feel comfortable on my finger. I wear them with a dimond solitare and it looks really sharp.

It's a really cute diaper, and easy to clean, but giving my kid painful rashes is a definite deal breaker.",1
206102,"I like this, but the arms are just a tad small - otherwise it would be 5 stars.  The pattern is pretty and you can't beat the price. I like having a trendy item without spending a fortune.

I paid full retail for this and my review is honest and unbiased",4

Still somewhat orange, just not the shade I was hoping for/expecting. The glasses themselves seem sturdy and block sun quite well, so I'm pleased in that regard.",3
186422,"Buy several normal sizes up!  Do not go by your t-shirt size absolitrly read the size chart.  But I really love this corset.  For the price and quality you can't beat it.

46885,"I really wanted to love these - but I couldn't get them to stay on my ears.  If you have larger ears they may work for you.  However, my husband (with larger ears) tried them and they wouldn't stay on either.  Also, I should add that we wore them for cycling and any amount of wind would take them right off... Perhaps if you were just walking around it wouldn't be an issue... again for larger ears..",2
164053,"WAY bigger than I thought. I figured they would look and fit fine since I have a large head and face, but these look comical. But I still love them! My friends laugh when I wear them but I can't stop wearing them! Just know that these are so huge they make you look hilarious.",5
171116,"Fits true to size! My measurements are 31-29-36 and i purchased a medium and i wear it on the tightest hook and it looks great! I've been wearing it to sleep for the past 2 weeks or so and i can  see i'm already getting a slight shape to my waist!
i highly reccommend this if you are a beginner in waist training",5
455111,"This shirt was even better than expected.  The material is light and soft, and the cut is flattering on the husband with a belly.  The contrast between the bright flowers and black shirt is striking but not feminine at all.  It seems to hold up very well in a suitcase, too.  Definitely a winner.",5
67879,Been looking for a nice leather backpack purse for some time.  I love this one.  It is the perfect size to carry everything I need.  It fits nicely on my back and doesn't feel like it sticks out.  The leather is good quality and the product seems very well made.  So glad I found this bag.,5
267422,"Awesome quality! And great material! The details are awesome and it looks so realistic! Very excited to get to show this off! It fit just right! I usually wear larges, and this was perfect. I am 5'6"" and 165 for reference. I would definitely recommend for Halloween or a great cosplay!",5
487641,Cute and fit my daughter well but not really impressed with the quality. The fabric isn't very soft. The red on the pants doesn't match the top- it looks more orange than red. I bought them a size up in hopes that she could wear them next Christmas too but I'm not sure now.,3

I tried it on before I wrapped it up for her and it's got a bit of weight to it. It definitely doesn't feel cheap. The chain was a little flimsy feeling, but that's easy enough to replace if it breaks.",5

I bought several pieces from different sellers to piece together a good looking Roman Centurion costume, this added that finishing touch that takes it up a notch. Had a worn look that I liked.

684743,"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it!

The ring is a nice thickness. It's sturdy enough to hold up to daily wear and tear at his full time retail job, as a manager, moving shelving and merchandise daily.
It's been several weeks and there seem to be no visible scratches so +1 star!

I believe the sizing may run just a tiny bit small? Maybe I simply ordered the wrong size. Who knows.

Overall this was a great purchase. Thank you for such a wonderful men's ring!",5
505312,"Since they cut the fabric at random points, the colors do not match up to the image shown. The bottom of my dress has the top part of the next white section and does not end in orange. The blue section was a foot higher and did not match the location of the blue section on the back half of the dress. Also, the pleats are not pressed firmly. There is a reason that this dress is not shown on a model.",2
336986,"Product is as described and does it's job well.  I consider myself on the lean side and even I could tell a difference on my tummy.  Comfortable to wear throughout the day.

Minus one star because I felt like it could have lifted a bit more of the backside.  But again, I'm lean and may have just not had enough to lift.",4
368519,"DO NOT BUY THIS DRESS! I thought it looked so cute but I was wrong. It comes in a cheap polyester material, not cotton like the description says. It is poorly made. The stitching is coming out and it has two holes in it. I am so frustrated that it is not eligible for returns.",1
615383,"These really do run small. I thought I'd heeded the warnings and ordered several sizes up, but they're still constricting around the waist. The thing is, I think if I'd ordered ANOTHER size up they'd be too baggy in the legs. Overall I think that these pants just don't work with the shape of my body. Might be better for folks who are very thin and not so curvy.",3

I am 5'4"" 140 lbs and the pant legs are a little long, not unbearably though. They are stretchy, not see through (if you wear solid colored underwear) and can be quite high-waisted. Overall a good buy that I will be keeping.",5
413836,Paying almost $10 for a long sleeve t-shirt is rough.  It's really just that.  It's not a heavy jersey either.  I really needed a brown shirt for my child and this is the only place I could find it.  I do like the color selection and it seems to be well made.  The color is a little faded already and I've only washed it a couple of times.,3
746217,"This is a very poor quality sport coat. First, it fits really awkwardly. Yes it is slim-fit, but the arms are excessively long for some reason. It's very odd. Also, the material is so cheap. It is very shiny and wrinkles easily.

Very dissatisfied with this jacket. If you're looking for a nice sport coat, just follow your department store websites and nicer brands will go on sale every once in awhile.",2

I will not be buying from them again.",1
658887,"My Sister and I love the sunglasses. Only one drawback was that 2 of the 4 ordered came unassembled and I had to be very careful in snapping the parts together. T'was like whoever originally packed them in their black bags was in a rush and just stuck them in there. Methinks the Pickers who put my order together could have not noticed (maybe) how the bag rattled and felt loose compared to the completed ones. Otherwise, they are comfortable, light and definitely gave my eyes comfort in the bright sun. Love the flip up lens!",4
383961,Very attractive shirt. The material is soft and light weight. It has a flattering shape to it and would pair great with leggings or skinny jeans. The color is a nice charcoal grey. Love how comfy it is while still looking adorable. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.,5
223066,"I like this purse - it's grown on me and it's working well to hold all of my stuff. The short handle buckles do come un-done sometimes, but not a deal breaker. I have gotten compliments on the bag. It's worth the $37. I'll use it through fall and winter!",4
73118,Beautiful hat! It is advertised as crushable but seems a little stiff now for that. Will see how that works in the future after I break it in. I plan to wear this daily so hope to get 5 years out of it as I did my Santa Fe by Stetson.,5
82804,"It's a nice piece and get a lot of compliments.  Also, a lot of people think it's two pieces when they see it on me but it's just one.  A very important note, it's snug.  So if you don't like your clothes to fit very form-fitting, order up a size (or even two).  I like that the length is well over my pants line.",5
504802,"Item was received sooner than I expected, which is great.  Looks fun, and fits well.  Easily adjustable to fit large or small wrist. Only complaint is that the clasp was broken when I took it out of the package.  It is easy enough to fix.  I bought (3) bracelets, all similar and (2) were broken.  Be advised, you get what you pay for!",3

You don't need to waste a ton of money on prescription sunglasses, the lens are clear and block out a lot of bright sun rays. Absolutely comfortable, I recommend it for anyone else who wants to have quick slip on sunglasses over their eyeglasses. It's a very good purchase, I actually ended up ordering another one. 5/5 stars",5

310463,"Purchased in black, good quality, made of rubber and material on the inside.  Its very comfortable, I wear it all the time underneath my clothes, over my tank top.  The waist trainer is long, since I'm short, 5'1"", it tends to ride up on me but I love this product.  Product is as pictured and contoured to fit a woman's body and is not square like some waist trainer.  This product will give you curves and make you look much slimmer.  I love it!",5
385670,"Based on the reviews, I thought I should go smaller than my normal size and I'm glad I did! If you have an hour glass shape and large bust,  size down.

I would advise everyone to go at least 2 sizes up.",3

More a dingy denim blue, you know when you wash dark denim and the color that washes out tints the water. That's the shade of blue they are.  They fit well and are very comfy, I just don't like the color.",4
726592,"This purse is very nice. For the price, it is a very sturdy and well-made handbag. The size is perfect, not too big, not too small. It looks exactly as pictured. It does come with a detachable cross body strap (I'm not using it though). Great purse for the price.",5
157514,"I ordered these leggings last week and received them yesterday. As soon as I took them out of the packaging I could tell they were going to be thin. They felt like a pair of  tights!! I tried them on and they were completely see through. Needless to say, they are already going back today. Highly disappointed in the quality.",1

It wouldnt suprise me if all these orders are messed up. Cheap quality too. You can tell just by looking at it..",1

69523,"The BFF Belly Bandit seemed to be very well constructed, but it was much more constricting than what I was looking for.  If you are looking for something to really hold your belly in, this product will work for you. I was looking for moderate support.  The seller was excellent - product arrived promptly and in perfect condition and my refund was provided promptly.",3
231664,I bought these for my husband.  I only got 1 pair to start with.  He loves them.  He said it takes a couple of wears to get used to them.  But now that he has multiple pairs he actively avoids any others in the drawer.  They seem to be very well made.  They are very soft to the touch and don't pill.,4
214183,"i ordered this product and it arrived quickly. i also ordered JASON Vitamin E 45,000 IU Maximum Strength Oil, 2 Ounce to ensure i have a smooth transition between each size and have no blowouts happen. if you are wanting to go up in size i think this style of tapper is the best way to go about it. and the oil makes it painless.",5
57188,"LOVE the colors and design! Great size! Holds my ID (and shows it well) a few cards, a few wallet pics and receipts without getting bulky. Great durable material, easy to spot clean. Case is true to advertised image, if not even better ;) Well made, sturdy zipper closure and thick, sturdy but easy to use key ring",5
124550,"Too Small, obviously not an ""XL"" as expected (I fit in size L normally)
Not a dress as I thought, but a top and a skirt. The top is UGLY and the skirt shorter than in the picture.
I'm really disappointed because it's Halloween soon and I will have to wear something else...",2
400833,"I bought these as part of my wife's Christmas gifts, but was unable to get them before Christmas. I thought they would look nice with the Byzantine bracelet I also purchased.
They arrive very quickly, but when my wife tried to put them on, one of them has its post so large that she was unable to get it thru her piercing. I plan to return and exchange them for something with a little more quality control if its not too late. Otherwise she's stuck with them in her jewelry box, pretty but unwearable...",1
441634,I got this for my little Whovian of a daughter because David Tennant is her favorite doctor. She is very happy. The fit is just right and completely true to size and the colors are bright and haven't faded yet! The design is very clear and bright blue. We are both satisfied with this purchase!,5
68533,"I'd give it ZERO stars if I could. Because of the design of the shoe my daughter developed a HUGE blister on the arch side of BOTH feet. And since it's been 60 days we cant return them. Shoes were on for almost 2 hours and have inch long blisters on size 4 feet (2 year old).

DO NOT BUY THIS POORLY MADE PRODUCT.",1
868575,"I was looking for very lightweight summer pants to protect my little crawler's knees and sun-sensitive skin during the summer.  These pants fit the bill.  They're very soft and lightweight.  Perfect for wearing under tshirts or dresses, or over a onesie for hiking or crawling on rough surfaces.  They are definitely sized small.  Little one is about 25lbs and 32"" tall, wearing 18-24 mo. clothes in most brands except Gap where she's still 12-18mos.  The 2-3T size of these fits perfectly.",5
347405,A tad small in the chest area but I am large in that area. The beige lining sticks out a bit in the back at the bottom and the sequin is very scratchy on your arms when you put them at your side. This would never be good for dancing your skin on your arms would be tore up. Might keep for a 1 time wear on my honeymoon then toss it.,3
53319,"I like is hat--the UV protection is nice and there's a drawstring in the back for sizing. It is a little big, though, and too floppy. The wide brims obstruct my toddler's view so she tries to pull it off more often.

Also, my daycare pointed out that it has the tie strings, which they consider a safety hazard. I tied them above the hat instead of around her neck, although that defeats the purpose of the ties!

I keep it as a secondary hat if the main one is in the wash or something.",3
485348,"I cannot believe the reviews on these bracelets. I have ordered 2 different colors and these beads are NOT REAL. Plastic beads strung in elastic thread! I can't understand what is natural, genuine, semi-precious, or gemstone about these bracelets.

A complete hoax.

Also, if it sounds too good to be true, that's because it is. No one in the world would sell semi-precious gemstone for these kinds of prices.
It made me a little bit angry to see these in real life. Like, come on! Use some type of acrylic and make the beads look just a little real... They don't even try",1
400567,"I love these earrings.  I was impressed by the size of them and happy to find they were a little more conservative for ""gypsy"" style chandelier earrings.  They look wonderful even with pulled back hair.  I wear them with casual clothes as well as dresses.  Plus the gold doesn't look cheap on the filigree, but it does look a little fake on the little discs on the bottom.",5
547581,While I found the actual silk screening to be somewhat cheap.  The quality of the shirt was fantastic.  The shirt didn't feel cheap at all.  It had a nice thick weave and felt very durable.  I won't knock it too much for the silk screening since my wife got it for our son's one year birthday party and will she will most like put it away in a keepsake bin to never see the light of day.,4
528409,Great looking modern cuff. The cuff looks just as it appears online and is much less expensive than other bracelets / cuffs of a similar design and quality.  I have slim wrists and this fits fine and is easy to get on and off.  Order was received in good shape and on time.  I'd definitely get more from this vendor.,5
115656,If your a thin person this would be perfect (if you're looking for something like this). I'm a size 8/10 so its to small. It is VERY see through so you'll need a slip. The elastic does not stay in place (that might be because its to small for me). It's a cute skirt and shipped pretty quick. All in all its good for the price.,4
670112,I'm usually a size 0 depending on clothing brands and a size 4 in swim brands. The top fits as expected. But the bottom is hella small! The leg holes cut into my thighs. I'm getting it altered to fit more comfortably. This would cause major chafing on the inner thighs if you were to swim for a long time.,4
380668,"I'm normally too lazy to write reviews but these are pretty awesome so i thought i better get on here. Anyway, these are perfect - they do not show under your clothes and they stick all day. I've used other ones but they were too thick and sat on your breast like a small lump. Made my boobs look weird. These shape to your breast very well - looks natural. I feel confident going braless, plus they're so comfortable you will forget you're wearing anything at all.",5
823625,"It didn't look like the picture, it came and the seams on the shirt are crappy looking and really weak. The straps aren't really straps because it's basically the fabric that they put on it and it looks like the straps are seconds away from being snapped off. I wanted to return it but I couldn't bother with the process so I might give it away to someone less fortunate.",2
573863,"It's an amazing concept and I loved the art!! The only things I didn't quite care for is that the shirt behind the design is sticky and tacky after wearing it in Texas humidity (which is unfair, since that is common in Texas) and the quality of the tshirt. I mean, it isn't enough to dissuade me from buying from them again, but it might not be first on my list.

I did receive this product in exchange for an honest review.",4
474068,"Standing at the college shuttle stop in central Texas on an unusually frigid morning, I see other kids in only a hoody and jeans, unaccustomed to such blustery conditions. They shove their poor, cold hands into their pockets in a feeble attempt to keep them warm. I smile, pull out my phone, and turn up the jams with my fingers snuggly surrounded by plush faux fur and water/wind resistant shells. The epitome of modern comfort. Eat your hearts out, suckers.",5
397250,"I though the socks were OK for the price.  They are not thick at all, just average.  One note through, that these socks are large in size.  If you have a size 10 or bigger these socks would fit you but anything under that wouln't fit well at all.",3
729838,"They were both to large and too small. The crotch area was really short, and barely covered my butt and the ankle area was super loose. Thought I'd I'd turn them into workout leggings, but they wouldn't stay up. As I was traveling, I didn't see the point in packing them, they went in the trash.
Poorly made, save your money.",1
524167,I Love this bag!!!  It has a middle zipper compartment and side zipper and two pockets inside so you have 3 separate compartments plus the side zipper and the two pockets AND has a top zipper too!!  AND on the outside you have a zippered pocket as well great for keys!!!  I LOVE THIS BAG!!!  Nice and lightweight.  The interior is a vinyl but you know that's not a bad thing if you spill something you can at least wipe it up instead of it soaking into a fabric lining.  LOVE IT!!!,5
403294,"This charm is tiny so expect it to be.  I have a hard time envisioning items by measurements so sometimes jewelry arrives and it just looks smaller than I thought it would be, personal issue more than anything since most give the actual measurements in the description.  It seems to be solid, though and worked well with the other 2 tiny charms I put on a charm holder for my daughter.",5
418536,"Cufflinks are OK.  A little small, but for the price (not ""original"" price!) they're fine.  The product description is not accurate, however.  It says the price includes optional engraving, but there is no way to order the engraving.  The checkout immediately goes to shipping and it arrives plain, with no engraving offers or options.",3
592800,The top is great and I love the colour. The only thing is the bottom is pretty bad. It almost looks like a diaper once you put it on as it's so wide so I would have to get it altered but the price was cheap so you can't expect too much. Otherwise it shipped faster than expected and it's a nice bikini.,3
793656,"This was the culmination of a long series of failed efforts to buy a Deadpool shirt.
There are very few companies that make cool graphic tees for fat people.
I haven't washed it yet - but as of the first wearing it is perfect with fit and with quality of material.

If it survives a wash - I'll look to the brand fore more shirts.",5
6003,"I have a hard time finding pants that fit. Often they are way to tight through the thighs so I have to go up in the waist to get pants that fit. These had plenty of room for my big legs to fit!  And they are good looking too!  I'm 6'4"" 280#s",5
440633,"This dress is so beautiful.  I bought it as a casual wedding dress and it's perfect.  The halter ran a little large but nothing a little bit of altering couldn't take care of.  I'm 5' 5"" and the dress was just the right length.  It's a little on the sheer side so choose your undergarments accordingly.  Given the price, I really couldn't ask for more.  I LOVE this dress!",5

For! !!!!the size the color the style everything. !!!!!from the shipping to the receving the service from Amazon is the T!!!! I highly reccomend this shoe to other drag queens ur gonna live! !!!!!!!,5
271872,"I wish I would have read the ""customer questions"" about the gauge of these. They did not fit in my cartilage at all and it was even hard for me to put the ball back on when I gave up on trying to shove the earring in...so couldn't imagine being able to put them on if they were in my ear.",2
223026,"I LOVE this piece - very pretty and fancy.  I haven't found anything to wear with it yet, but I can't wait.  If you look closely the pieces look a little cheap, but you haven't to really look close and who is going to stare at your neck like that????  No one.  It is a great statement piece and definitely a good deal for the money!!",4
817330,"I read the reviews and was worried it would be snug on me or too small. I am normally a medium, so I ordered a large out of worry. I prefer my clothes to not be too tight, anyway. I believe I could've gotten a medium and been fine. If you don't want this to be fitted, order up. But if you do, order a size up.",5
593575,I am giving this a 1 star because the sizing is wrong for plus sizes!  The 1X is NOT a (20-22) it is more like 14/16!  I will say the material is nice but if it is the least bit snug it will show any lumps or giggly bits!!  I am going to try larger size just dislike inconvenience of having to return and re-order.,1
50702,This thing is huge!  I didn't realize it would be too big to wear without looking like an idiot.  It is well designed and looks to be quite sturdy.  Nice detail.  Just too big to be a necklace.  I will hang it on the wall but I will never wear this.,3
84655,"I order from this company a lot and this is this is the worst of the worst. The ""studs"" along both sides of the dress are made of a strange material, plastic, I think. The gold-tone color is on some of the studs, not on others and partially on the rest! I would return or exhange this item if shipping it back to China was not more expensive than the item! I highly recommend NOT purchasing this one.",1

I use it all the time on my son and daughter at the beach, pool, water park etc.! I always get the biggest size since they it has an adjustable string in the back. If you are looking for a sun hat for your kids that you can always use in the water, this is it!",5
283948,"When I first put these on I wasn't sure I would actually like them because they do fit like tights. They are really comfortable and not see through at all!
The only reason I did not give them a full 5 stars is because the waist rolls down when doing sit ups or other high intesity workouts, but they stay in place when walking or running.",4
300228,nice ring BUT I've owned it less than a year and in the grooves I now have cracks. Contacted Groove about their 90 some odd year warranty and because I bought it on amazon they want me to pay to have it replaced. Most likely will never buy another one.,1
753752,"This is my second time purchasing this product. The first time I lost the ball at a fraternity party. The color is a little darker than the picture portrays, but not by much. With this particular ring you need to be cautious. This ring does not move like a traditional belly ring, and occasionally will get hung up on clothing.",4
402214,Love the look and feel of this beautiful watch.  The color and sparkle are amazing and the band is super comfortable.  The watch arrived very fast and was well-packaged and I received an e-mail confirming my order and verifying that it had been shipped.  My only disappointment is that there is no paperwork included--I have no idea what the three numbered circles are on the watch face or who to write to for warranty information.,4
438258,"I thought I was ordering a S or a S/M but instead got leggings which were huge, one size fits all - I assume, and would be much too big for my petite daughter.  Not worth the trouble and expense of returning, so I will keep these and wear myself as cold night PJ bottoms. (I don't wear leggings or tights of this weight in my climate.)  Material is soft and plush.  Too bad this item lacks very necessaary sizing.",2
214674,"This is a very nice vest and the sizing chart seems accurate. My only disappointment is the color is more orange than expected and more orangish than the photo. I realize this item description does say orange, but in the color list it is listed as brown. However it is still a beautiful color and works.",4
747162,"Nice shoe, but the design is rather odd in that the tongue of the shoe won't stay in place. It bothers my son enough that he only wears them occasionally. The shoe itself is good quality but that particular design feature seems to be problematic. It could be solved easily with a little loop or fabric to hold the tongue in place (DC shoes and Nike usually have this feature). It's not easy to see on the pictures but it's a problem.",3
713438,"This blouse is really beautiful in regards to the color and the way the fabric feels, though the one thing that bothered me is that this blouse is made with a dye that doesn't hold well and has bled onto undershirts I've worn, as well as other clothes it has come into contact with. Overall I would suggest not wearing anything that is lightly colored with this and also to consider sizing up as it does run just slightly small.",3
795544,"The ring was intended for my husband (size 10.5) but ended up fitting my 9 year old son. Also the punisher emblem was supposed to be engraved into the metal. It looks more like a rub on emblem. My son ended up with the ring so it was okay, but it would've been great to have it be exactly what I ordered as the gift for my husband. I will keep looking for another ring and hope this helps someone else in their purchase.",3
577085,"When I received the hat it smelled musty so I threw it in the dryer on cool heat, delicate setting.  The hat smelled better but the braid across the top had come off - it was hot glued instead of being sewn on.  I am going to sew the braid back on an use it but I would not recommend it to anyone.",2
434052,"Because I have neuropathy in my feet, I expected Berks to be comfortable, but found the footbed was stiff and hard, thus not soft and comfortable. They went back and I probably won't buy this brand since the footbeds in all the shoes appear to be the same.  Also, the cost of shipping was prohibitive, nearly half the price of the shoe ($32.00)!",2
88713,This ring is exactly what I wanted!  It is constructed very well and fits comfortably.  I had to order it smaller and after one exchange had the right size.  My original ring is a size 10 and I ended up with a size 8 with this one that fits well.,5
418441,"I will have to say i recieved them SUPER quick. I love everything about them. Their beautiful and mean so much to me. My friend has died from domestic violence and i ordered them to represent her for me and some friends. I love everything about them. the price, how fast i received them and the product. This is a must buy. I will be ordering more soon. Thanks so much and its worth every penny.",5
67240,"I absolutely love this ring and wear it often. I always remove it to wash my hands, shower, or clean, and it has really kept its sparkle. The only thing I don't like is that it was bent when it arrived. Seems like something that would be noticed during QC! But, I love it nonetheless, and the bend makes it no less comfortable.",4
771650,"My friend got this crossbody from DSW, but when I went to buy the same one, it was already gone... So this is the only place where it was sold. It is a little pricey for this size of a purse, and the price isn't competitive at all. However, I do love the purse!! It just took longer than expected to get shipped to me.",4
210068,"I like this product. It fits my Pebble Time and a woman's wrist without having the extra length of the band flapping about. I do wish the clasp snapped shut more crisply. It's hard to get it to snap securely sometimes and I have to fuss with it. But so far, my watch hasn't fallen off.",4
41026,"I bought the black socks with 3 white stripes.  Right on the packaging it says 90 - 160 lbs.  I'm 5'4"" and 150.  The tops of the socks want to roll down and my legs weren't skinny enough to get up to the point of where the photo shows.  I'm disappointed in this product.",1
69718,This costume is super cute and sexy without being slutty. It is a little short so I wore some volleyball shorts with it. I was sad it didn't come with the boots but I went to a thrift store and bought some high boots and spray painted them purple and it definitely made the costume. It's super comfortable and everybody else will love it!,5
590101,"I was looking for a knit lounger for around the house.  I love this one.  It is comfortable and washes very well.  I ordered a large, not realizing they were women's sizes instead of misses.  I could have used the Med, in this sizing...but the large is not too large and very comfortable.",5
610848,"Yes these run a bit small. Be careful when buying Ritchie boots, these are the old kind and are made very well.  The new ones are HORRIBLE.  These boots worked very well for us in Oregon.  They are not totally waterproof but were fine for our hiking trips.  Our child refused to wear rain boots.  Traction is awesome.  He never complained that they were uncomfortable and trust me he would. Wish they didn't change a good thing.",5
266465,"Definitely not the same color as the one in the picture. Leather looks washed out on the one I received and the metal part is not as half a bright and shiny as the one in the picture. Bottom line, It just does not look as vivid and alive as the one described. It's  like having your TV on cinema mode versus vivid. Just update the picture and will put 4 stars instead of 3 so next customer knowservice what he is buying.",3
257562,"For the price, I didn't have high expectations, but they were just what I was looking for as a gift for a friend, and when I got them I was pleasantly surprised. They look like they will hold up decently, but I could see the stud bending easily if not cared for. They are just subtle enough, about a quarter inch diameter.

The recipient loved them, and they can probably even be worn to work because they aren't gaudy. I would buy this type again for other people without hesitation.",4
313897,"Good quality and stylish. However, picture looks a way lot better than the actual item. The color is not as vibrant as it shows. And, it's kind of long but, that may be my problem as I am only 5'7"". Lastly, this is not worthy of having a price tag over $35 bucks.",3
147798,Ive been wearing this a few days now. I wish its been longer so I can review its durability in both color and strength. Aside from that it is what I expected from the other reviews and its description. I purchased this so I can still wear a band when Im painting/gardening/cleaning and I don't want to get the diamonds all dirty. Its comfortable.,5
793658,"They shipped fast, they are so cute but they are extremely small! I ordered a 6 for my 3 year old and a 10 for my 8 year old and everything was way too small. The bra to the bikini is flimsy as well and doesnt stay on their tatas. Not recommended.",2
452242,"What more can I say. If my picky man loved it, it must be great. He's a die-hard bi-bold leather wallet man and not just any old bi-fold leather wallet will do. Believe me, we've searched through a bazillion (yes, I said bazillion) of them trying to find that perfect one. But, this past Christmas, out of ideas on things to surprise him with, I took a leap of faith and ordered him this wallet (because it was on sale) and low and behold the man LOVED it. SCORE!",5
808605,"I am a regular dress size 16, and I ordered an XL and it fits very well. I had to deduct one star because this dress displays too much cleavage for my comfort level and because the zipper is very ""sticky"" and doesn't open or close easily.

I'm sad I can't wear it as is without being VERY risque, and have worn a cardigan over it which covers the pretty sleeves and princess style neckline.",4
867964,This shirt is cute but it runs so small. I ordered up another size and it still to is too small. It just has no give to it.  I have to shop on line due to being in a cast on my driving foot so returning it is not an option unfortunately,2

258862,"There are our favorite swim diapers for our baby. We used them throughout her first year and just ordered more for her at 15 months because she finally outgrew the 6-month size. They fit nice and tight and have kept many accidents in! Do keep in mind they aren't meant to hold in pee, just poo. They wash up nicely and we used the same diaper all summer instead of having to buy and waste countless disposable diapers.",5
48803,"Wow, Where do I start it was great, I got it for my grandsons 5th birthday party it was a little too big, would better  for a 10yr old boy,but my grandson the prince rocked it, he loved it and so did we ,came the next day due to me waiting to the last minute ,I would purchase again.",5
200807,"We ordered one size larger than needed, still too small by a couple of sizes. Ninimour hard to deal with, they will let us return if we pay shipping or give us 30percent of original cost an we keep. If they spelled out this policy no one would ever buy from them! Not acceptable.",1
745418,"This top is just as cute in person as it is online. My daughter loves this top, and prefers this one over and of the others she has in the closet. She points at the picture on the shirt and says kitty.. every five minutes. It is a really comfortable shirt that fits her perfectly with a little growing room. The colors did not run when I washed it for the first time either, like some clothing does. I received this product at a discounted price in return for my honest review I would have paid full price.",5

On another note, the date on the shirt was wrong, the year they fought was 1980 and the shirt indicated 1975. Leonard wasn't in the olympics until 1976. Nonetheless, the quality is great just be sure to order one size larger and check out the date in the shirt.",3

That said, it is soft, the length is perfect (mid-shin), and it does everything that you would want a robe to do.  I would suggest, however, that you not purchase this robe unless you live in a climate with actual seasons (i.e., not Texas), as you may find it to be too warm to actually wear it.",4

212371,"Bought for my boyfriend and he totally fell in love with these gloves. They're soft, warm and work perfectly fine with his phone. The details are perfect and they came with no flaws. The fit was perfect too, snug and still has enough space for his hand to breathe and move freely. The length goes right in the wrist were he puts his watch, so it insulates inside the winter coat too. It brought a nice bag where he can continue to keep them. Very good quality and soft leather. Will definitely recommend.",5

I selected this trident because the product photo shows the middle tine being taller than the other two, but the trident I received had all 3 tines the same height.

Very dissatisfied.",2
452171,"When I made my order, I carefully read the reviews. I didn't want any pocket showing on my dress, so I  ordered the dress without pockets. Apperantly it is the wrong style dress with stupid pockets at each side shipped from the vendor! And even they changed photos online along with sleeve length. But I still remember what I have ordered. If I could, I would rate it zero!",1
636177,"Bought a green pair, orange pair and blue pair.  All different sizes all accurate and all fit. My kids all loved these they are their favorite shoes they love the mouth an feed the shoe grasss.  It is pretty cute. Yea the antenna fell off but easy to put back on an the eyes did come off but we glued them back on. The shoes stink but they are rubber/plastic .we will buy them again. Great price,fit an must be comfy cause my kids love'em!!!",5
660913,This is so freaking cute. I have a goldendoodle and a labradoodle and it fits both of them nicely. It kind of reminds me of a balaclava for a dog. I only wish that it was more fluffy. I received this product at a discount for my honest feedback and review.,4
482382,"The picture doesn't do this wallet justice.  It is very elegant and roomy.  The colors allow it to go with many different purses.  You won't be disappointed.  As always, Coach does an outstanding job with quality.  I'm sure this will last me a very long time.",5
302394,"Didn't have very high expectations for this but decided to order anyway. When it first came it looked really small. After trying it on, it seemed to fit well enough.. I am a 38D so I wasn't expecting a ton of support if any at all.. And I was right. But I took out the little ""pads"" they have in the bra and used a strapless backless stickie bra for added support. It worked perfectly!",4
408272,"1: The bra fit, which was great.
2: The hooks seem cheap- they started coming out a week into wearing the bra.
3: It was comfortable... until the wires started poking me. It'd be a great bra, but probably not if you're a large breasted and full figured woman- and by that, I mean 40DD+.",2
700514,"This dress deserves more than five stars it's absolutely gorgeous & I can't wait to walk down the isle & surprise my future husband. It was well tailored to fit my body & arrived extra early, no future bride-to-be could go wrong if they choose this dress you will feel like royalty #princess",5
397994,"I actually bought this for convenience getting through the airport for a trip.  However, I love it SO much...and it fits so perfectly in my Healthy Back Bag...that I will use it as my wallet from now on!  It would probably be too large for many purses, but it complements the shape of the Healthy Back Bag perfectly.

The fabric is sturdy, and there are stash spots for absolutely everything...including my checkbook and cash.  I really like that it zips up...but it's not ""typical"" organizer thick nor bulky.

Perfect.",5
113502,"These wings are very pretty and light-weight. I received many compliments on the wings. I put them on an took them off several times and the fastener did not tear off. Very durable. It was fun to flap the wings, and to make the wings go over children like a giant butterfly. It's also a nice way to get people to talk about the life cycle of a butterfly and talk about the monarch butterfly.",5
564993,"Boy likes it because he loves hats. Fit well because of his boy head!!!! The colors are hard to match with an outfit so most of the time he is not a fashion plate, but an eccentric little man! Which is fine by me. The hat was sent in good time so problems with the sender.",4
438117,"I've had this necklace for a month or so, and I could not be happier!  The quality of the charm is excellent, brightly colored and nicely detailed.  The chain is lightweight, but sturdy, with a good clasp.

My favorite thing about this necklace is all the compliments I get when I wear it out!  I have to tell you, this is the most complimented accessory I've ever owned.  I guess it must remind folks of their Sesame Street days, just as it does for me.",5
361227,This is a tighter fitting shirt and rather thin material. It said hand wash and hang dry in the tag which I missed if it was in the description. I will save it and use it for layering under a sweater but more than likely not wear it this summer. It's not as flowy as the picture. It is extremely soft though so I'm sure it will be very comfy.,3
630030,"This is an oversized purse... and I don't have enough to put in it, but that may be a good thing for my back health! Very cute color, the straps are comfortable and there are enough pockets and zippered sections to satisfy me.

Four stars because the zipper closing the main part of the purse doesn't connect completely from one side to another and can be a bother if you are looking to get into the purse in a hurry. I may end up removing it myself.",4
636588,"I love the fabric and design of this tank top.  I am a frequent cruiser and have a skirt this would work perfect with for a casual, but dressy, evening.
Unfortunately, I will return because it is just cut too small for me.  I wear women's size clothing and ordered the largest size.  I compare this product to Junior Size ladies wear.",3
115798,"This shirt is really cute but fits a little snug, it is still worth it for the price and the look. It's really cute and the material is very comfortable and washes well. I have had really good luck with this seller every single shirt I have purchased. I ordered a large amount of shirts and it it came in two shipments, the second one got lost which contained about seven or eight shirts for my Birthday (I was really anxious for them!) and they resent them all. Great seller (uxcell), great product!",5
684480,"Cute, but a tad bit too big on me (29"" waist). I can wear it, but it doesn't sit where it should and the lack of tension makes the closing hook too loose, meaning it falls off if I move the wrong way. If you have a bigger waist than I do, you're golden. It has stretch to it (it's basically a huge spring) so I think plus size girls should be able to wear it too.",3
105877,"Sadly the ring doesn't fit, it's about a size 7 or 8 (I'm guessing) and it took a while to get to me. Either way I like the box the ring came in(It has Ciel and Sebby on it), and the ring it self is good for my collection. :)",3
433995,"The most horrible bra I've ever purchased.  I got two different styles and could not get them over my head to put on.  No hooks, which I knew, of course.  Unless you are a size 2 and very limber, you do not want to buy this bra or any version of it.  Horrible.",1
153882,My husband loves this so much I had to buy one for my Dad. They both love it because they said it is super comfy to sit on it when its in their back pocket. Nice and thin but still fits as much as any other wallet. Also very contemporary looking!,5
477689,"These were cute but they were too long for me. I'm 5'2 and have a short torso and I couldn't get them to fit quite right. I think if i could have removed the metal piece holding together the criss cross I could have got it to work. It is adjustable but not removable. Also, the clips don't grab on well. I was trying to wear it with a skirt that was a sort of slippery material so the clips would just slip off if they were pulled a little.",3
554992,"If I have a choice to give 0 star, I would. The first order, the coat had no inserts for the buttons and threads are hanging everywhere. I liked the design, so I re-ordered it again. This time, one button was missing, the ink marks on the coat. Do not order anything from this company. Quality is horrible.",1
99282,"I received this purse, unwrapped it, examined it and re-wrapped it for return.  It smells like chemicals, and the ""pleather"" pieces are not wrapped and turned so the black interior does not show.  IT LOOKS AND FEELS CHEAP.  It also looks like the handles and thin straps would break easily if you filled it up - which I guess would be the purpose of getting a large purse like this.  It is LARGE. For the price, I can get something much less cheap looking at a discount department store.",2
130925,"My first purchase from Allegra K and gotta say, I am not disappointed! I was little worried, but it didn't hurt to try. The material is not cheap looking/feeling as someone else pointed out. It is VERY soft, kinda like a satin pillow case. I have shirts thinner than this from top name brands. I got this in medium, since that is what I wear in US size. Not tight at all. If you have large arms or boobs though, this may be tight in the chest area, but for me, it was perfect.",5
613252,"I ordered a size up due to reviews, which is good, but is still unproportional. The top part fit nice but the bottom what too short in length and very wide. This is very see through material. The buttons also come off very easily so I had to sew them back on. Can't return because it costs too much to ship back.",2
214156,"It is just a little too big, but I think I could work with it. It looks exactly like the picture and very well sewn. If you are looking for a birdcage at a reasonable price that is very good quality, this is who you need to order off of.",4
4297,"I bought this for a great gatsby themed holiday party. Worked out great! Pretty much bought all of the accessories shown in the picture as well but from different vendors(all are sold separately). It really was the best costume designed for the 1920's that I had seen and I got a lot of compliments on it!

I did read previous comments before purchasing and read that it runs a little small in the hips. I bought one size up from my current size, and it seemed to fit perfectly. Glad I listened to them!",4
480369,"Very, very, thin fabric. The design is nice, the colors are nice, BUT this dress is not made well. The stitching was crooked; where the solid top met the printed bottom. No matter how much I adjust the dress, I looked crooked. There is a reason why it is cheap.",1
336895,"If you have a decent sized booty along with a smaller waist--it's difficult to find the best size. I opted for one that fit my waist, which works great except for the part that surrounds the butt cheeks are too tight which cuts off the circulation in the thighs and makes it impossible to wear anything that is really for fitting because the imprint of whats going on underneath is apparent.",3
311906,"This top is cute. There's nothing wrong with it. I ordered my size according to the chart. I usually order a small, but I selected a medium based off the Asian sizing and it fits well. The only thing that might be misleading is the picture. The top isn't black. It's a very dark navy. Other than that, it's cute, and the feathers come true to color.",4
432230,"I had a difficult time finding kippot for my wedding that looked great and that I did not have to order in batches of 100. These kippot were just what we were looking for for our small, informal wedding. The shipping time was significantly faster than what Amazon said (~10-14 days) and customer service was very responsive to questions.
One tip- when you get the kippot, we found that airing them out for a day or two dissipated any odor from the packaging.",5
371800,"Nice pantyhose for the price.  Not to dark and not too light.  I haven't worn them yet but if anything unexpected happens when I do I will update this review.  Based on the look and the feel they seem pretty close to DKNY stockings, which I love.  I received these at a discounted price in exchange for my feedback.  So far so good!",5
975,Great product if you are going to have it tacked on by machine. The two pin clip system just did not work for me. snug on the bottom but space on top. the ribbon needed to be designed somewhat concave. I am keeping it because I am going to have it permanently attached by machine.,3
380968,"The product does seem to stay put. However, it has so far been visible under all of my clothes under which I tried it, including regular t-shirts (mainly due to the contour rather than the color) :-(

It would probably be better to have nipples showing than to have a flower petal outline show from underneath your clothes. Not quite sure if there are any clothes which would show nipples but not these pasties.",3
265134,Fit was as expected. Very soft and very warm. Great value. My only complaint is that they do not have the button at the top to cover the zipper. I wanted these zippered pajamas because my little 18 month Houdini can undo the other types. The button covering keeps him from getting to the zipper and unzipping himself. However without that I've had a naked baby several mornings. Because of this I wouldn't buy these again.,4
382511,"I love my tie dye shirt dress! Color is wonderful! After reading some reviews I decided to size up. Im 5'4 with a large chest, size D. I normally wear a medium, but I ordered an XL in this so that it will fit loosely and be long enough. The length is mid thigh so it's long enough to cover everything. It fits like an adult size large tshirt would fit. Perfect for a swim suit coverup! I would recommend sizing up at least 1 size from your regular tshirt size.",5
696176,"I am so in love with this dress. I bought this for my daughter for a special event that was only 2 weeks away. I contacted the seller and explained when i needed it and it arrived early! I did not send measurements, just ordered the normal size my daughter wears ( size8) and it fit perfectly! No alterations were needed. The beading is pretty and the fabric is nice. This dress is a great deal. We are very happy with it!",5

I'm hoping the company / supplier will provide engraving options as this product is one you will want to keep and treasure for a long time !!  Patrick J. Duarte",5
514760,Quality was good. The size was just too small for me. I'm a size 6/8 and it was rather snug -- had to pull it up higher. Ended up returning because I didn't need it for the dress after all. Probably would have kept it if the fit was better for me.,3
2673,"They are larger than I expected but that was a nice surprise seeing as though most costume accessories run super small!

I was looking for something inexpensive for my daughter, 12 years old. I really believe the quality of this necklace would be suitable for anyone. My wife really loves it and wants to consider keeping it for herself and getting our daughter something else.

there's none....the seller is insisting that it fits small to medium..not true too..because I am only medium size..but I can't fit it..

I bought another 3 dresses together with this dress, but they are the same as in ""AS IS"" as to what is advertised..",1
291449,I wasn't too impressed with this. This is definitely one of those cases of you get what you pay for. The top seemed disfigured. The skirt was too long. The material was definitely cheap looking. I ordered the black and red sets in two different sizes (small and medium) but they were both horrible. Returned both.,2
71947,Going by previous reviews I ordered the 18-24 month size for my 10 1/2 month old son.  He is 23lbs so was concerned about which size to get!  It was a little big but it didn't look it and he was comfortable which is all that matters!  The hat was way too small but my son's head is bigger than most kids his age.  Loved it!!!,5
265582,"Oh my gosh! This arrived today. I may live in this the entire Fall and Winter season. I have thinning hair and this is a perfect, comfy hat to help with that when I don't feel like fixing my hair with a plethora of hair thickening products. Highly recommend this as it's the cutest hat I now own.",5

I ordered a 10 for my grand, as she wears 10 in other shoes) and should have, really, ordered a 12.  I ordered a 13, ultimately, so she could put heavier socks in there and they are easy for her to put on and run in, now.  Returns were very easy, fortunately.",5
753975,"The styling is sharp - the nylon exterior and bright metal hardware look sleek, but not too flashy.

Overall the bag feels very well-constructed: no loose threads and lots of fancy details.

The bottom of the bag has some kind of (non-removable) insert to keep it flat, but it's soft enough to compress if you're trying to stuff it into a small space. It's very lightweight & easy to travel with. I've taken it on 2 trips so far and it's holding up beautifully (and is water resistant as claimed)",5
561716,Very nice quality and keeps time very accurately so far. On the gold not sure how plated it so try not to touch it too much. The price was perfect for it. It is a bit hard to see the hands in lower light but not a big deal. The band is fake leather but looks surprisingly real. Does not say where it is made but certainly does not look cheap in any way.,5

They are sturdy and durable.  This is my second pair.  I wear them in shoes that I plan to get dirty or sweaty or possibly wet (if it's raining or muddy out).  This allows me to preserve the expensive custom ones!  I have no more pain, so I feel they work well and would definitely recommend them for anyone with similar foot pain.",5

These are a must for newborns that like their hands by their face!",5

649553,Bought this costume for my niece. She requested this by name so I was able to order it for her. She says it is too small but I should have triple checked the sizing chart.

Very easy to maneuver within, great tutorials, and full functioning Help solutions with step by step instructions.  Pricing here is a little steeper than if you ordered through a QBKS ProAdvisor.  They can get discounts to ease the bite out of your bank account.  BUT, Amazon's pricing is usually less expensive than other vendors including Intuit!  :)",4
182578,Amazing quality for the price! It took 17 days which is like 2 weeks and 3 days to get here. Nothing is wrong and good thing I ordered a size up. I was skeptical since I usually wear mediums but I saw small cHest reviews and they were right overall everything fits so good!,5
303962,"I am a 32 D and I got the medium. I do not normally wear sports bras and I think this feels great. Not too tight, although, I do have way more cleavage than the models, so maybe it is intended to be a bit larger. I will repeat though, I think it feels great and really supports my boobs. The shipping was also faster than expected.",4

It is made of a light see through satin with black soft lace and comes with a pretty white thong which fits and matches perfectly.",5
471921,"This is a great coat. It hugs the body to keep the cold out. In my opinion it fits two sizes too tight. But, saying that, a tight fit keeps the wind-chill out, so in the long run, when it was -30 degree in Kansas this winter, wind-chill, it protected me very well. The only negative is that it does not come with side pockets. The hood is nice and the coat itself is very stylish",4

Therefore, avoid this if you don't want a nip-slip. the bottom wasn't so bad it was actually pretty nice fit a little large around the waist but was still somewhat useful.

The sleeves are very short and on the package it says woman's Plus size in 1 line and US size 10 on the bottom. Looks like it has a fuller bottom but it is very straight. Fabric could be a bit heaver but if it fit I would probably keep it,1

This was the first time I ever ordered anything online. I would order this dress again in a heartbeat! If you are hesitant don't be! You will love this dress,5
274560,"I gotta say, this is the best belt I have owned. Extremely high quality craftsmanship. I was pleasantly surprised. It is holding up very well so far. When you first get the belt you will need to attach the buckle to the belt. I placed a towel over the buckle and used a light tap with a hammer to lock it in. You'll see what I mean when you get it.",5
639246,I like it. Works in my pool. I got it all the way to the bottom of 13 ft. And it's still working. Pretty stylish too. I haven't gotten any scratches on it yet but I'm pretty sure I'll get some eventually. The clip comes off sometimes too if ur swimming with it on,5
832293,"I purchased this jacket for my 12 year old son and he loves it. It fits perfectly, the measurements was correct. The graphics on the front of the jacket was of good quality. It is a thin jacket no lining , just have to make sure he wears a long sleeve shirt.",4
339278,"Not nearly as slim as I'd hoped. The middle pocket is pretty useless to me, but I knew it was there in advance. I'd just hoped they'd used a thinner material as the bottom liner on it so the one sewn end wouldn't be so much thicker than the rest of the wallet.",4
50645,"I had one in a tan color and then ordered another in black. This bag has room for everything...cell, credit cards etc. no need to carry a wallet because it has  a place for everything you would carry in a wallet already in place in the bag. One great price and one great bag.",5
94228,"I bought this as a gift for someone.shes a size 3 and in the end...it was still a little big.maybe after a wash it'll shrink...not sure.anyways...not at all like the picture which what i expected. More like if u were to wear a large shirt with a bowtie kinda thin feeling.but still super cute if ur into the whole anime kinda look.shes tiny so i shouldve gone smaller.i bought her a small shouldve went xtra small(shes size 3 in us) 5'0"" and 105 athletic build to give u an idea.",3
592219,"These are my husband's favorite shoes.  Always has been since he was a kid.  I'll probably bury him in a pair!

809743,"I love my new outfit, Sisiyer exceeded my expectations! The color and fabric are perfect, I took a pic to send to my sister, the dress is for her 50th bday part. I asked Sisiyer to help me get it on time and they were amazing, excellent customer service. I might just order a black one too, I love it that much. Thanks Sisiyer, I'm a extremely satisfied customer!!",5
62247,CONS: The silicone strip was hard to keep placed directly on my incision; it should be larger to accommodate different scar locations. Difficult to take on & off to use the restroom. PROS: Nice tight compression holds in the postpartum tummy & helps support posture. Panty is a cute cut.,3
670197,"I ordered these glasses thinking they were going to be on the cheapy side. Cause after all....aviators and GloFx? Who would have thought! To my surprise, the aviators itself looked awesome and then the added Defeacrion was the cherry on top. I definitely recommend these. FYI - I have a smaller head and they fit perfect.",5
628706,This is super cute however it fits VERY small and VERY short. Not for anyone with a longer torso or over a size XL. It does have a built in bra panel which is nice and the material looked to be sturdy. The colors were spot on with the photo.,3
628145,"Love the light material, expected shrinking, but it shrunk a little more than expected I wear a large, these shrunk to size medium! I will order again however ill order a size larger than I normally would ware due to shrinking! I do not like skin tight clothing I can't complain they are perfect for summer undershirts",5
458468,"The color of the bag was nothing like the picture, there were strings hanging off of it and it is much smaller than it looks in the picture. The straps are very thin and I doubt this ""backpack"" could handle the weight of more than one school book. I'm very disappointed and would send it back if t weren't such a hassle.",1
59038,"I bought this for a Christmas gift, the wallet is exactly how it is pictured, arrived on time, I think he is going to love it because it is a really cool wallet if I had to say 1 negative thing it would be that it is a little bigger than a average sized wallet.",4
362316,I brought this for the office and was so please I brought two more.  My glasses fit nicely.  Its lightweight but very sturdy.  My associates are already asking where I brought it and asking if it comes in their favorite colors!  YES and there are all beautiful.,5
273979,I had eyed this necklace from other sellers for a while but hesitated because of the price. The price here was great. The necklace is very solid. The chain is not fancy but thicker than I expected and looks great. The clasp is easy to put on and easy to take off with a mirror. It hangs at the perfect level. I am a coffee junkie and a science teacher. I will be buying more of these for gifts.,5
457294,"This t-shirt feels amazing - it's very nice and soft.  I'm right on the fence between small & medium (5'4"", 120lbs) so I ordered the medium...way too big.  The seller was awesome though; responded immediately and paid for my shipping to send it back and sent me a small.  The small is still a little big though - should have gotten an extra small.",4
154644,Cheap looking earrings. I am returning not only because they look cheap but so late in delivery. I ordered so long ago that I did not even remember ordering.  When I checked my order history it said:  Expected between end of August and September 17.  Said shipped on August 5th and arrived October 7th. Not acceptable.,1
269766,"Believe the reviews that say it is difficult to peel the backing to get to the adhesive.  For me, it is impossible. I have now shredded the foam, cut small pieces to try and find something to pull, and still have backing that I cannot remove.  It does size the hat.  If left on, the backing would seem to not let the hat band breathe properly.  Buy something else.  It has to be better and less frustrating.",1
555356,"It is a nice jacket, but I am not sure it is worth the price. It fit him snug and looks like it was built for someone with girly arms. I am not real sure about the quality either it kind of looks cheap and for what I paid for it, it wasn't worth it. My fiance can't even wear it, it is so small in the arms!",2
122715,I have to confess I don't use this wallet. I bought it for the flip up ID that is actually a pull out item for holding credit cards. I still have the wallet. It is fairly large it has four card slots on one side and three on the other and it has pockets behind the slots. The bill fold section has two sides separated lengthwise. I gave this five stars because I really like the removable id holder with one clear window. Each side can hold three cards comfortably and it is very comfortable in my back pocket.,5
282248,"I'm 145lbs 5 7"" and I ordered a US medium which is equivalent to a size 8-10 and an Asian XL. It Iooks great but is a little snug a US large or a Asian size 1XL would have fit better. The length is great it covers my huge butt ",4
764959,"The guitar is really cute.  But smaller than expected, even though length was provided.  This was very difficult to blow up and by the time I could get it closed, half the air came out.  After 5 or more tries, I got most of the air in, and the clasp closed, but the next morning, the guitar was completely flat.",1
669440,"Great glasses! The diffraction looks great at light shows, concerts, raves etc. The mirror effect looks cool too, no one can see your eyes. The only drawback is that wearing these glasses can make it difficult to see what's around you (especially during raves) because there's a slight tint. If you want to avoid the tint, i reccomend you go with the non mirrored version.",5
447595,This luxury diva braided elastic stretch belt is more than I expected!! These belts are fantastic!! I'm so glad I took a chance a purchased 2. I bought one in grey & one in navy. They are just the right width & they really stretch! The braiding is sturdy. I would probably buy more in other colors. I love these belts!,5
607511,"These are definitely not true to size on the size chart provided. The pictures of this dress looks great, but the actual dress looks cheaply made and is incredibly heavy. The mesh fabric on the back is not even trimmed neatly. It is frayed horribly. I had high hopes for this dress, but it just turned out to be another disappointment.",1
630759,"Although they were a bit snug for ""that time of the month"" I was totally happy with the fact that I didn't have to worry about any mishaps from mother nature while wearing these pants. The flowers are perfectly positioned to give me the confidence I need when Aunt Flo is visiting. Thanks!",5
264196,"Perfect skirt that hist my 5'3"" large frame right above the kneews. The fabric is the right thickness for war weather, but it is not see through or cheap and shiny. This is a quality prodcut and I plan to buy more. The foldover waist will allow different lengths, and there is enough fabric in the skirt to have a graceful sweep.",5
866938,Dress is not the quality of the picture that is shown.  if you notice the lace and how the waist is pleated.... realize you get what you pay for.. the dress on the left is what was advertised... the one on the right is what i got..  I also sent measurements that were taken by a seamstress and it was still too big..,2
645364,"The bottoms in the photo look way smaller than they are. I am 5 feet, 100 lbs, athletic build, and the bottoms (size small) were barely cheeky on me like they were in the photo, which is perfect! I loved the bottoms, but the top looked a little funky on me. Unfortunately I decided against keeping it because I felt like I would be messing with and re-situating the top all the time.",3
407697,"I bought this swimsuit with a slew of other styles (I'm preparing for a trip to Hawaii!). I'm a size 7/8 typically, but swimsuits run small so I got a 10. It fits like a charm and this suit is VERY cute!

I was worried about buying a swim-dress style, but I sure didn't need to be! My biggest concern was looking ""old"" as I am 26. But this suit is sporty and fun! It fits like a charm, is SUPER flattering, and I love it. Currently contemplating buying another!!! =)",5
717412,"I love these sunglasses - They are so stylish!  I get compliments all the time on these glasses.  My eyes are very sensitive to light, so much so that oftentimes I have to wear shades even when it's raining.  Due to the hyper-sensitivity, I don't like to buy sunglasses without trying them to see how dark they are.  I took a chance on these & I'm glad I did!  They are perfect!",5
99735,"The bag style is as depicted BUT, the handles are too stiff, too short to use over shoulder AND,the zippers are trouble. The front zipper is heavier than the top zipper and it does not close no matter which direction you go in.  The top zipper is difficult to zip. I realize that this is not a super expensive bag but I did expect better quality. Now that I have read reviews of other Scarleton bags,I would NOT buy this brand again.",1
556505,"Beautiful new dress. I did receive this shirt/dress in the mail, it is quite fetching and will be a lot of fun while it lasts.  It is charming and very pretty.  It's not a heavy duty or hand-made lace, but it is not expensive either.  For the price I am very satisfied with my new dress.",5
93980,"These gloves are ok, nothing special. When they arrived the stitching was already loose. I barely pulled on the thread and its coming out. I haven't even used them yet. they'll be in the trash in about 3 months. I ordered a large but they fit like a medium, all of my other gloves are large and they fit great. i think i'm done buying sight unseen anything.",3
302428,"I was nervous to purchase this in one size fits all and I should have been.  It fit ok, and I honestly could have gotten away with it, but it was just a little too tight and the straps on the back were hard to situate to look like the model.  I would say that if you are very petite and a D, it would fit, but if you have any meat on you, its not going to look right.  Its mainly made for B/C sized breasts.",2
434316,"My daughter, who does not like dresses, wore this to her formal and it was great--no alterations needed!  We bought a little shrug to go with it and a tank bra and the medium fit her really well--5'3"" and about 115 lbs.  She took the belt off by the end of the night, but it still looked great without it, and she received so many complements from her friends.",5
738355,"These came in a branded plastic bag. They were packaged properly and arrived on time and without transit damage.
Fit was near perfect and finish of the product was way more than what I expected for the price. Pattern can be off at stitch lines but it's a non-issue with me as this is what I would call underwear/thermal layer and so not critical that everything lines up.
All in all, a great product at an even better price.",5
232311,This necklace is beautiful!!!  My daughter received this necklace with her two sons names for Valentine's Day and it quickly became one of her favorite jewelry pieces.  The workmanship is quality and the necklace seems to be made of good material.  Definitely would recommend to anyone wanting a very reasonably priced personalized necklace!,5
182458,This bracelet was a gift for my mother-in-law. Her previous magnetic bracelet broke plus it didn't have a tight clasp and kept sticking to metal objects and coming off. This one has a tight clasp and stays on. She doesn't think it's as strong magnetically as her old one. Looks great and arrived on time. Time will tell if it works like her old one.,4
628847,"I love this dress!!  I'm not normally one for bright colors, but this is so cute.  Fits perfectly, nice fabric and arrived in just a couple of days.  Giving it a 4 only b/c I have not worn it for a long period yet so holding out until I do.  Super cute!",4
173671,"I followed everyone else's recommendation and went a bra band up, so I'm normally a 32B, I purchased a 34B. It fits like a 34, its snug now but eventually will losen. Just get your normal size bra, it comes with a band extender regardless in case it's too tight. Keep in mind over time your bra will stretch so keep to your normal size. The quality is impeccable, built better than VS bras. Gorgeous, sturdy, comfortable. More salmon colored than pastel peachy as the picture shows. I would and will be buying more from this brand.",5
496901,"I've been purchasing ray ban products since 2006 however I was disappointed with this item that was delivered to me, it looks fake, coz I know the quality of the genuine Ray Ban sunglasses. I will not recommend this item, I just wasted my $190. Better buy in the real Ray ban shops.",1
52659,"Great hat, love the way it can be adjusted in the back and under the chin. However, it was still too big for my 6 week old, but wore it anyway because I couldn't find a smaller one. At least he will grow into it and be able to wear for awhile.",4
803332,"I got this for my Gear S3 Frontier. Originally I had purchased the Hardley Roma 16-22mm band but it didn't look good on the S3 because the band was too thin. This one is wider and looks great. Did not come with spring bars however, and cannot use the quick connect style spring bars. It was easy to resize with a small knife blade and a pair of tweezers.",5
354831,Made just as well as covers ordered from banks or online and for a lot less money...  I ordered two since I have  a second checking account and these covers are so sturdy ...my checks are top tear works works well with this type of cover.  The register slides in and when you close the cover nothing is sticking out ..... Lays flat and fits in mypurse but I could see a man using the black or brown .....Highly recommend this gem ...,5
835060,"After reading several reviews I decided to order this skirt. I'm so happy I did! It arrived as expected, without damage. I tried the skirt on and I am very impressed!!! I ordered it in a L/XL, I wear an 8/10 ladies (I did not want it too snug.) It actually fit perfectly. I absolutely cannot wait to wear this skirt to the party I ordered it for. Will post pictures at a later date.",5
461650,"Love this top! It is even better in person! The design is unique and different, with the beautiful mesh panel and neckline. Very high quality fabric, and the fit is perfect. Just size up one size in Allegra K tops. Totally recommend this top.  Plus, it arrived sooner than expected.",5
488573,"Fantastic wallet! I get so many compliments on this. It is incredibly difficult to remove my driver's license from the slot if it's pushed all the way inso I always keep it poking out for easy access. Also, some of the credit card holders are really tight and you cannot put regular sized cards there. Overall, LOVE this wallet even with these few flaws.",4
107693,"Gorgeous coat, fits amazing!! The store emailed me prior as I asked, to verify my measurements. The fit is done perfectly! I'm amazed at how beautiful this coat fits along with the quality of the fabric, the inner lining is very nicely done. The only small thing (I mean very small is that if it came in a box that was done a little better for shipping it would be perfection (just an idea here guys?) thank you so much! I've finally found my coat after many tries with other company's , your the one!",5
180230,"Not quite the quality I expected for the price. Seems like it should be selling for about $12. The top is hard and the cooling band is nothing more than a strip of material around the brim. The top is very hard and not soft around your head at all. Feels like you are wearing one of those cheap straw hats. The brim also flops over both directions without your effort and can look absolutely stupid if it flops down and you don't notice it. For $39, not very good.",2
773010,"This top fits okay, although its a little snug around my bottom. I'm not sure if that's the way it's supposed to fit or not but it's not a problem. It will work for me because I just wanted a longer top to wear with a pair of leggings and this does the trick.",3
405656,"I purchased this with the understanding that it was in fact an opal. Not so. The stone is clearly costume jewelry. It is an ugly white translucent stone with barely a hint of color. Also, the stones are on hooks, NOT attached solidly with a full loop so the 'gems' keep falling off the base with any movement. BUYER BEWARE!!!",1
603104,Item cane quick and looks like the pic. BUT  It is not an actual sweat shirt. It is a long sleeve shirt cut like a sweatshirt. And it is definitely not a women's extra large.  More like a girl's extra large. Ended up giving it to a friend instead of the mother in law who was meant for.,2
64772,"We bought three of these for Father's Day for my brother and uncles. They were a hit! They are all AZ. Cardinals fans and really liked that not only is this a keychain, but a bottle opener and nail clippers as well. Pretty handy and clever. P.S. They come in all the NFL teams.",5
114246,"The wig is awesome! It looks great and has a thick texture to it. It has very bright colors and looks more girly than the other ones I saw. As a matter of fact, a lot of people commented on the wig when my daughter was trick or treating... My daughter was a very pretty clown in this one! I kept it in case if I want to be a clown myself next year :-)",5
826766,"The picture is misleading, as the colors represented in the pic aren't actually what you get. Instead of pops of minty green and all, it's blue Aqua. The ring isn't bad...I just expected it to be more blingy and sparkly than it actually is.

It runs pretty true to size...maybe a tad bigger. I ordered a 7 and it fits like a big 7.

I did get it at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review.",4
85141,"Was looking for a hat that protected the neck as well as the face and head from sun exposure.  We also needed a hat that would stay put in the middle of a windy lake while fishing.  All characteristics of this hat met all of my requirements.  Wide brim, drape over the neck, adjustable strap, grommets to allow airflow - perfect.  Good design.  Good construction.  Fair price as well.",5
418617,"I have had numerous pairs of Ray Ban sunglasses, but I like the folding type the best, as I do not need a big purse to carry them around, they fit anywhere, and is like the idea that they won't break as easily as my other ones because they fold up so neatly",5
844807,"I agree that while the top is cute, it is way too small.  I ordered extra large, and this top could fit a kid.  However, the seller did ship the item to me in tact, and on time, so I can't blame the seller much.  But, it would be nice to see a note attached to the item, informing the customer that the item runs very small.  Other than that, I have no further complaints.",2
414799,OVERSIZED BILL KEEPS SUN AND RAIN OFF YOUR FACE AND EYES. SWEAT BAND INSIDE CAP ABSORBS SWEAT. FULLY ADJUSTABLE TENSION ALLOWS PERFECT FIT ALWAYS. PLASTIC INNER BILL SUPPORT MAKES IT MACHINE WASHABLE BUT YOU SHOULD WASH IT BY HAND FOR LONGER LIFE WHEN YOU'LL NEED A GOOD FISHING CAP. ALSO HAS A LINE WITH A CLIP TO KEEP FROM LOSING IT WHEN YOU ARE BOATING AT HIGH SPEEDS. GREAT ALL AROUND SPORT CAP.,5
562991,"Heavier than expected. The cutout isn't perfectly clean (the cuts curve through the thickness of the metal), but that's what happens when you cut through metal in mass-production. Regardless it looks totally badass.

The chain was difficult to unlatch initially, and I ended up bending it, but this stuff isn't really supposed to be indestructible.

It gets noisy sometimes. I am going to look into whether tag silencers will fit these.",5
143384,"Love these pants. I have had several thru out the years and will keep buying them as long as they are available. They look nice and feel comfy. The sun protection gives a different level of ""comfort"" knowing I am not getting too much exposure on my legs. I use other clothing items from Collibar for the same reason and have be very satified with every one.",5
787705,"cheap material, looks and feels like a knockoff very thin. fits smaller then the size i have only wore it twice and the zipper doesnt want to zip, it splits after its zipped, even the zipper looks cheap seem like a very low quality sweater please don't waste your money on this sweater",1
80554,"This is the 3rd shirt I've ordered from Patty and it won't be the last! I'm size 10, 36D and I usually get a large in these shirts. They fit WONDERFULLY, feel great, and look sexy without being trashy, and this shirt is no exception. Patty shirts do show your bod, though - they are ""form fitting"" without being tight, just FYI.",5
702720,"Although a bit large (my daughter is a 2, which we ordered, but to be fair, she didn't check the measurements before ordering). It arrived at the earlier date of the range. The quality was really good. Skirt had 4 layers so really flowed nicely. Brad work was well done and very symmetrical. Would totally buy from the seller again-but since it came from China, would order it with plenty of time.",5
101122,"These are nice overall, I like the material and they are put together well - but the chest area is a bit big on my daughter (Who also happens to be pretty thin) - So they will work nicely as under shirts for her but definitely not play shirts or pajama shirts.",4
233594,"I can't attest to how long they'll last, however, I registered them with ThinOptics & they are now guaranteed for life i.e. free replacements.  These are just what I was looking for!  I thought I'd need to buy an antique pair of pince nez until I found these.  They fit in my wallet & are perfect for things like reading small labels.",5
436511,I love these hematite rings...I found them to be to fragile for me.  I continue to break them.  I switched to a magnetic bracelet with Hematite.  It serves two purposes for me.  One to ground me and to help when the barometric pressure headaches come calling,5
578575,"I really love this jacket! Some reviews scared me about the jackets being too small. I order a small and it fits me perfect. There is actually pretty good wiggle room. I am petite though!
I love the removable lining. The only reason why I gave 4 stars is because it could have. Even made a little better.",4
431117,"I wasn't prepared for it to be that big, plus I wear a 5 so it's really huge on my hand. I was hoping it was like my ring for traveling, which it is, but mine is only a 2 carat center. I am keeping it, but I'm not very comfortable wearing it so maybe I should send it back. It is nice.",4
110853,"One other reviewer described this product as ""looked very, very cheap"". That's because it is CHEAP-looking! With Amazon products, a cheap price doesn't typically mean one gets a cheap product. But this time - yep, it's cheap looking. The bright yellow plastic flower gave the whole necklace a cheap cheap look. Did I say enough times that the necklace looks cheap? I will never wear it. It's gone into my donation box.",1
7886,This ring is very pretty but awfully slim another words small.  Yet the stones are very vibrant!  For the money you can't beat it!!  You may want to size up a size on ring because it seems to run a little small too.  Since it's small I stacked it in with a couple of other rings and it looks good.  It's not really a ring people are going to notice.,4
401617,"This ring is just lovely.  It's well made, a nice sized stone and cute design.  And all for so little money... it's a great deal.  I've been wearing it for a week and the only green on my finger is the peridot stone!  I would recommend this ring to anyone.",5
863250,"This coat is beautiful. The color is exactly what I wanted. It is a little tight in the chest for me but I expected it to be tight. I ordered the large and I'm a 34D. I'm able to button the coat up and move around, it is just tight across the chest. The sleeves are a perfect  length.",4

They are ridiculously cute. Also, ran into a short friend of mine who can wear children's shoes because of her small feet and she was rocking a pair too! They look quite grown up so if you're in the same boat you might like these!",5
31377,"I accidentally bought pocketless...  That small SNAFU aside, these are quite comfortable sweat pants.  At first blush, it appeared that the ankle elastic was quite slack and looked as if they'd slide down onto your feet.  Several washes and wears later and the elastic does its job just fine.  No guesswork with size.",5
675319,The dress I recieved looked like the picture and was nice and soft. Unfortunately it does run small so I contacted seller for a return. They had wonderful customer service and offered me a refund or to ship out a dress in a larger size for no charge. I decided on getting the dress in a larger size because it is very pretty and I definitely want it in my summer collection!,5
496027,"I bought a few packs of these from a local store and they ran big, just like all the reviews and comments said.  I got these and they seemed like a size smaller than they should be.  Still fit but not as comfortable as my other ones.  They seemed kind of thin in comparison too.",4
755171,"Way cute and an excellent value.  These look great and are comfortable to wear.  I wear a 7.5 and ordered a 7.5 and they fit perfectly.  I actually ordered three pairs, taupe and black for me and red for my daughter, and am very happy with all three.  They look way more expensive.",5

The velvet feels more like velveteen (thinner) and the ""burnt"" parts are very see through, so I wear underwear that matches my skin. I don't think it will last more than a few years, but for 20 dollars, it's not too bad(:
WARNING: it comes a little bit above my ankles, so it's an awesome dress for short people, but anyone who is average or taller in height, yeah I wouldn't buy this.
I bought this August 19 and and received it on the 9th of September.",4
60527,"These look great on, the small fangs are still a nice and noticeable size. They look like real teeth and i got a lot of questions on whether they were fake or not. Once you get used to molding with the putty you can get a great fit that's easy to pull off and on when you want to eat. Less putty is better, make sure it's nice and malleable. Can use these many times. Great buy.",5
59525,"It has pockets on both sides for the lazy man who needs a clean apron but forgot to wash his. Wish the pockets were a little bigger so my check presenters slide in a little easier but they fit two, maybe three real snugly in one pocket so I can't hate on that.",5
107425,"Being a bigger guy, I always try to buy stuff a little bigger than required to allow for some shrinkage in the wash. Even following the directions on the tag, stuff still has a tendency to shrink a bit. While the shirt didn't shrink bad (just the usual minimal) after washing, it seems like the collar stretched or something. I can still wear it, and will...I just feel like the shirt isn't the quality as some others I've found on here of late. Still love the design and the price was right! Gotta' love Uncle Si! Shipping was super fast!",3
147094,"Very cute headbands, my daughter looks so cute in them if only she didn't try to rip them off as soon as I put them on her. They are very soft fabric. My daughter is 9 months old and they fit great, but I also think they will fit for many more months as well. I hope she gets comfortable wearing them because she looks so cute!",4
481903,"I ordered these as a gift pkg  they came so close to the holiday that I did not open them ,what a mistake 2 was broken but thank goodness the receiver was my sister and  could repair them but with this said If I place another order it will be more than 20 days before I need them and I will inspect first ,they are nice neck filler but large. The large bead is the size of a quarter for size idea purpose",3
220133,Wasn't due to receive for another 2-3 weeks but it was in my mailbox today! It's much better than expected I'm thinking about ordering a few more for gifts I love it! I will be replacing the chain because I let my daughter look at it and she snapped it two minutes later Haha,5
511893,This dress fits wel but the colos are not as vibrant. The picture gives the illusion that it will be bright and colorful but its not bold. The colors are there but they seem faded a little bit. The material is however a very nice quality. It works and I like it.,4
334088,Great Customer Service. My purchase was followed by an email from company to make sure I was satisfied with my product and was able to use it properly.  My husband uses this belt everyday since Christmas and it is very durable and looks nice.  He said it is comfortable and it was very easy to cut to add to comfort for the length for his waist size.  I also like that if he looses weight we can cut it even smaller without having to purchase another belt.,5
255159,"Arrived with some of the boning poking out, which was incredibly uncomfortable. I was able to fix it by sewing it closed, but still super annoying to have to fix an item right away.

It's very stretchy, and nice to move around in. Doesn't smooth out everything the way that most corsets do, but the material is very soft and buttery. Feels nice on the inside as well as the outside.",4
289310,"I really like these socks. They are perfect to wear with dress shoes to add some flair. They are extremely comfortable too. In the set I ordered, the Venus and Cherub set were a tiny bit smaller than the rest and fit snugly on my ankles, but were not difficult to put on/take off. Overall it was a good purchase, made a few people envious.",5
243786,"I'm normally a size 1-2 in skinny jeans. I'm 5' 1"" and weigh 108lbs. These fit, but they are more snug than they are on the model, even though I took the advice of other reviewers and ordered the size 6 for a slouchy ""boyfriend jeans"" look. If you are considering ordering these, order at least two sizes up.",2
647728,So disappointed. Not a cashmere fabric. Xxl is more like a child size small and the color is a darker pink then pictured. Not worth the $$ spent or the time spent waiting for it to arrive. First time to order from this company and the last. I'm a loyal Amazon shopper.,1
733324,"This is not a sweater. It's very thin rough cotton with several raw edges where there should have been a hem. Also should note - the button at the top is non functioning so it's not quite as easy to put on and take off.
I was sent the wrong color as well.",1
134147,"Cute summer dress. Love the bright vibrant colors.  Very light weight.  Little sheer, but as a cover up was perfect.  I thought the chest part was really small.  And made me look boxy. But my daughter tried on and it looked great.  So not a total waste.  Happy overall",3
12109,"Nice arch supports. My physical therapist recommended these arch supporting insoles to help heal up my injured ankle faster. Slipped the old flat insoles out of my shoes and slipped these in. These have a lot of arch support, which my feet aren't used to. I may end up ordering the Powerstep ""Originals"", which have less arch on them. (The Powerstep website lists all sorts of their orthotic insoles. Some with more arch, more cushion, for ball of foot pain, memory foam 3/4 length, wide feet, slender fit, and more.)",5
267984,"I was really excited about this rosary for my son's Communion. Especially because it is designed for it. However, it practically fell apart by the end of the one hour mass. He hadn't even handled it before then. It remained in the packaging until today. For sentimental value, I will just deal with this and not request a replacement. Wouldn't order it again.",2
460358,"VERY SEE THROUGH! the under layers can be seen through the shirt.  It was too tight to fit a tank and a bra so I skip the tank and it still was very see through, if I could order an xl (im a medium overall) it would have allowed for a tank and bra so it was not so see thru.",3
400197,"i am usually a size small, so i ordered a medium (i was adviced to do so by one of the reviews). its so short i need at least 4 inches extras in the lenght(im 5'7"",  its more of a long skirt for tiny people!!! its too thin for flamenco dancing but it has pretty color!",1
706447,Ordered this for a Christmas  gift. When I went to wrap it I realized it had a big hole in it and a long pull through the fabric. I returned it and ordered another one but had to pay 5 dollars more than what I originally paid because the price had been increased. The first one came all wrapped up in a roll. The 2nd one came nicely packaged. Was folded flat and had no flaws.,3
798213,"This is my prettiest shirt that I ever had. Perfect size. The review that said --""runs small, order for the next bigger size""-- is not true.
I would love to have the same for different colors too. I strongly recommend to all users to try for it ! I guarantee that you must love it !!!!",5
243875,"Love this swimsuit as well. However like the other swimsuit I bought with this one it is small in the chest. This one is quite small in the chest for someone with larger breast(38 GG or H), so another top will have to be bought from another store. Besides that it fits perfectly, it fits my hips, but and thighs perfectly, looks fantastic on me, and is an overall good product. Can't complain too much, especially since I didn't expect the top to fit all that well.",4
274112,"The leather is fine, and I like the way the clasp works.

But even though I haven't worn the belt all that much or under unusual conditions, the black finish has worn off parts of the metal of the clasp.
This makes the belt cosmetically unwearable..  The attached photo shows the worst part.  Temporarily covering the exposed metal with black magic marker isn't a good solution.",2
177431,"This is a great dress, love the olive color. I ordered a size small, which is my pre-maternity size - but it is a little snug now around my belly.  I'm 27 weeks and my bump is quite prominent and sticks straight out so that's maybe why.
I want to order another, but will try medium next time...I just hope it won't be too long.  The small is a perfect length for me - I'm 5' 1"" and I wear flip flops all the time now, so could be a little short on taller people.",4
44481,nice looking. would be super comfy but just a little to tight in the front hurts my toes after about half an hour if buying get a larger size too bad they don't offer half sizes as that would have been a perfect fit for me. otherwise im very happy with them,4
547988,"Well made, nicely lined, I originally tried to find a pack that would take a letter size clipboard, but those were all larger than I found comfortable, and this canvas model came close. It comfortably takes my 9 inch tablet, GPS, and a whole lot besides, in its two zippered compartments, and button down front pocket. I usually carry my backpack over one shoulder, and with the zipperable backstraps that's easy to do. Well stitched and well lined, couldn't have asked for more at the price. Should last.",4
637594,These were bought for my 4 month old and the reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because they were alittle tight on her thighs. She is not a very big baby and I was concerned she would be uncomfortable. These were a good price and they were very cute. So I was still satisfied.,4
202531,"The product is beautiful. The problem was that when it arrived it SMELLED/STUNK like mold or sewer. My husband didn't even bring it inside. He tried to let it air out in the garage, but the smell was so bad no one wanted to get out of our vehicles in the garage and come inside through the garage. My husband ended up putting it in a sealed coffee can, and it has been there since November (it is now later February). Has anyone else had this happen?",2
316452,"I love these earrings! I was hesitant at first because most earrings I get leave my ears sore after just a few minutes. I have worn these 2 days in a row for 10 hours each time and my ears feel great! Also, even though they look heavy, they are not at all.

The only thing I noticed is when i had to he on the phone at work today, they got in the way a bit.

Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I would never recommend a product that I wouldn't use myself.",5
327821,"This ski mask kept my daughter and I warm. We wore them in the Columbus, Ohio 5th line 5K. Face, head and neck felt no air. We did wear a knit hat underneath. These Balavacas are definitely what you need to run/walk in cold weather. Plan on ordering a black one. I wanted Black, but that color  would not ship Prime. I really don't understand  why one color will ship Prime and another will not????",5
93254,"Three of the four pins worked, but one would not clasp and one of them was a little rough.  There were extra ""barbs"" or chunks of metal that weren't removed in the finishing process, and they snagged the scarf that I was wearing a little and they wouldn't lay evenly because of the weight, but the front parts of the pins (the parts people could see) were very pretty.  They would work to decorate a jacket... or maybe a different kind of scarf.  It's possible I just didn't know the trick to pinning it.",4
738834,"I love the Price!....and the trendy detail of cargo pockets and drawstring waist. Light weight material, so it is great for spring and summer seasons. I did follow others advice and sized down one size. These do run a bit larger. (A size large 14 fits more like a 16). So with that in mind it fits perfect. I did not have any patches or anything like some reviewers mentioned. Just awesome classic goodness! :)",5
587269,"They look nice, but were actually bigger than I thought (I have tiny hands however). Problem is all of them were too big so it was almost impossible for me to wear without it falling off, so I had to use pliers to reshape them and make them fittable (which was a pain by the way). Also since I read that the paint chip (and they have while I was refitting them), I decided to paint them with a matte coat of nail polish and now they look lovely, and will probably last longer too.",4
62069,This product was a must for me after having my c-section. I had a horrible pouch under the incision and it got it back in place very fast. I continued wearing it long after because if made me feel secure and supported while healing. I did not like the other style however would highly recommend this particular product.,5
793400,"Beautiful dress at a great price. I wore it to an 80's theme Prom, and I got a lot of compliments. Very good quality fabric, and it was comfortable.

527017,"The robe was supposed to be a medium, but is more like a large. The hem is already starting to come undone, and it's only been washed once, so I'm going to have to re-hem it. The arms are huge, especially at the wrists. There is no way to keep the cold air off your arms, and trying to do dishes while wearing the robe is a challenge in keeping the cuffs far enough back to keep them from getting soaked. On the positive side, the material itself is warm and the color is nice and doesn't run.",3
469151,"I advise anyone who buys this dress to go a size up from your U.S. size.  I normally wear a U.S. 2, but bought the size equivalent to a U.S. 4 (so a large). I would mainly put into consideration your bust and waist when selecting the size. The large fits my bust, as long as I don't wear a padded bra, and I am a 32 D. It fit my waist well, mine is 24 1/2"". The length is nice though, I am 5'6"" and it isn't too short for me.",4

640048,"I had high hopes for this shirt, and they were crushed when it arrived. First off I ordered an XL and it was so tiny and there is no tag in the shirt to tell what size it really is. Also I thought it would be cotten, but no it's shiny looking and stretchy and awful. Also the picture shows Christian's face on the bottom of the shirt but his face is huge over most of the shirt and my tits make it look like he has crazy eyes. Not happy.",1
846627,"Bought this shirt for a Battery FRG Picnic. I appreciate the military humor and like supporting a Veteran Owned business, but the quality of the shirt is why I have ordered several of the other designs. The shirt fits well and the material is soft. The personal note and decals were an unexpected surprise.",5
234956,"Nice looking top, but I ordered a medium since I'm 5'2 and weight 110 and this top fits a me just a little too tight.  So I gave it to a friend.  I know Amazon would have let me return it without a problem, but decided to give it away.",4
709849,"This is very short. It fit as expected, but the length of it has no comparation to the picture. I am about 5'7 and this fits way above my jeans in the back. Almsot to middle back. The sleves are too short too, if I pull them up a little it makes it looka little more natural being on the elbow line! I don't consider my self to be super tall orhave extra long arms either. But the lengths of this is no where close to being what the pictures look like.",2
459660,"Love the material and the fit in the waist. Unfortunately, they are going back as the fit in the hips & bum is HUGE. Extremely unflattering on me. Once again this thick waisted woman strikes out. It's a common frustration for me....waist fits & hips/bum don't or hips/bum fit and waist is too tight! Sigh. Why can't they make pants for girls my shape?",4
193523,"WOW!  came in a timely fashion, looks great! I took the pendant off the circlet, and put on a chain. Look so much more expensive than what I paid for it.....under a dollar and under $5 with shipping!  I get compliments whenever I wear it!  It is more tomato or bittersweet than a true red.",5
604007,"The bottom is fitted with a wire to help the dress keep its shape. That might work if you bought it off a hanger, but cramming it in a box bent the wire out of shape and we couldn't get it to look nice. It fits strange too. Big around the arm holes and my daughter is neither flat chested nor busty. She basically put it on and fell on the floor laughing.",1

I always take an 8 in skirts, from any brand.  this skirt was tight on me.  not just in the waist, but across  the whole lower torso.  to claim that this is one size fits all is absurd.  the fabric is lovely, if a bit thin.  love the style, and am disappointed that I had to return this skirt.",3
310630,I received my trainer really fast! The condition was great it was everything I expected! I'm usually an xl in everything so I ordered the xxl to be safe but it was still a little tight even on the last set of hooks. (This waist trainer came with 3 sets of hooks) other then that I was really satisfied would definitely recommend to a friend but as far as sizing ugh idk what to suggest.,4
68787,"I bought these for my daughter who is almost 3.  She loves them and wears them even when we aren't at the pool.  My only complaint is that they are a bit difficult to get on, even for me.  Would recommend them though because they are slip resistant and comfortable.",4
270493,"I wanted a unique purse that was a reasonable price. This is exactly what I wanted. I never liked the expensive purses everyone else had. This is really great to use. Holds a lot of stuff!

Reminds me of autumn.",5

625949,"Fit is really small. my daughter is 5'4"" and 110 to 112 lbs and  the size small was so tight she couldn't get it buttoned. My daughter is an Asian teenager, so if you have any type of figure at all you might want to size way up or try another style altogether.
The medium fit perfect and is a nice blouse.",4
506033,"There were no ""boxes"" to check for size or select on the page to place an order. It was also posted in another Amazon page, however that one appeared to have 3/4 length sleeves. So it appears this seller lost me as a customer twice today for this dress. Get your advertisings together.",1
511658,I love all my Chamilia jewelry and this is no exception.  They do excellent work and the craftsmanship cannot be beat.  I decided to make a bracelet for my Florida Gators so started with the G to see if it would work.  I recommend Chamilia highly.  You can't beat the quality and price is excellent.

514127,"I bought the largest one possible. I wear a sixteen, normally. I also wear a DD cup. Based on other reviews, I ordered a xxxl. It looks long, but looks good/fits well once on. The only real ridiculous part is the bra inserts- they're appropriate for maybe an A cup (at best). I'm just going to remove those, because they're the only things getting in the way of a good fit. Love the skirt.",3
30894,I have to say they are ok.  Simply because they are too big.  Way too big.  However they are made very well and I was please to see they were on the thicker side of fleece.  I donated mine to a homeless shelter but would of worn them and kept them had I gotten the correct size.  Thinking that was part of the problem although I do think sizing is generous.  Had they fit I would of 5 starred this item but in all fairness I could not fully review the item.,3
734614,Love love my skirt!!  No slip required!! I love that I can wear my skirt two weeks in a row different ways and no one even knows it's the same skirt! It is much to my enjoyment to have something that is nice in my size. I love that I can wear it short or long and that is friendly to my wardrobe. The skirt is easily washable and doesn't wrinkle yay no ironing for me!!!,5

625739,I don't agree with all the rave reviews. My tank got pilly after only one wash. Maybe i'm just OCD but I planned to wear this under a cardi but they look too shabby to wear outside after washing. Also I washed gentle and line dried so not sure why this happened. Waste.,1
230680,I just got these today and I have to say that so far I'm impressed with the quality and feel of the bra overall. Now I haven't worn it for more than 8 hours so I'll just have to leave it at that for now. I'm extremely satisfied with the quality for the price that I paid. Sure beats buying ONE bra from Victoria Secret for the cost of six!,5

But call me crazy I ordered this twice because I couldn't figure out why the lace seam was showing through the lace, but I guess that's how it's suppose to be. It's very thin and you will need a slip or something under, but I love the dress. I'm getting married in a treehouse and it will do perfect for the scenery.",4
121942,You get what you pay for and it came earlier than I expected and it fits me well I just think it makes my but look weird but my boyfriend likes it lol instead of wearing it under my clothes he likes for me to walk around with them on. So these five stars are from my boyfriend also! Thanks,5

393501,"These came in a really cute box and was everything I was hoping them to be. I'm huge on Amazon reviews, that's how I trust to buy a lot of things. They fit comfortably, they're pretty cute and you can't even tell that I'm wearing something fake to give me a little extra in the behind. I would  recommend!",4
616697,"This product was so close to being perfect and it's a shame because if it did what it was supposed to then I would give it 5 stars. It has a manufacturing flaw of not grasping my ear at all.

365136,"Personally, I love this dress! It is very lightweight, so it is perfect for summer! That being said, I was not expecting it to be as thin as it is, but it's not see through or anything so that's alright! It is adjustable so can move loosen or tighten it to fit your body!",4
256021,So I bought this dress for my winter ball because I don't like to get super dressed up and I put this with gold sparkly wedges and a gold statement necklace  and I have never felt so hot but yet conservative at the same time.

519495,"The fit is not made for a tall person. In the arms at least. If i have the sleves extended to my wrists, like a normal person, the seam for the armpit area is not where it needs to be.

Plus the pull tab that closes the zipper tends to wedge open when fighting to zip the sweater.",2
775190,"This dress is super cute, the material is very heavy which is great for hiding ""flaws"" but not so great for summer. I had been wearing with tights and boots - perfect combination. The dress is very well made. I ordered a large and I am 5'1"" 160lbs, it fits great. If I was any taller I would be a little concerned with the length if planning on wearing it without tights. At my height it is just above my knee.",4
677663,"I ordered a medium because most comments said the shirt was smaller than they expected. My experience is it is bigger than what I would consider a medium. Since it is 100% polyester it is more loose fitting so remember that when buying. Other than that, the shirt is great.",4

That is my only complaint about the bracelet.  I would gladly order from this store again.",5
670939,"I had to get this fitted to look nice, I expect most people would have to do the same. I am only 5ft tall and once it is hemmed to get the waist in the right place it will be just long enough to touch the ground. Tall girls may not like that",3

505654,I was so impressed by this piece.  It is so soft and fits exactly as indicated (order 1 size up for US).  This particular pattern is actually quite slimming and is soft enough to sleep in.  The colors are vibrant and the design covers the entire t-shirt both front and back.  I will definitely order more,5
511439,"I did not like these because they are thin material, like stockings or regular tights.  I was expecting that these could be used as pants but you definitely would have to wear something that covers your bottom when wearing these.  I returned it and got Matty M leggings instead.",1
166401,"I first came into contact with this company when I found a pair of these pants on sale at TJ Maxx.  They were SOOO comfortable and worked great for all of my workouts from weight lifting to PiYo to kickboxing.  They are even cute and comfortable for errands around town.  Loved these pants.  So when I found more colors on Amazon for even less than I originally paid, I went for it.  These pants did not disappoint!",5
178839,"The item ship date changed, so it arrived later than expected. Despite that minor setback, everything was as expected. It fits great and looks just as the picture shows. It's very fun, cute, retro, and the modest bikini bottom doesn't make you feel uncomfortable in public. It also hides a troublesome belly area, if that's a concern.",4
199451,"The mask arrived on time for Halloween! The mask is made of some sort of foam and it seems very delicate, but it lasted all night so no complaints. My vision was impaired slightly but I was able to walk around. Most importantly, fans of Doctor Who knew exactly what I was!",5
381014,"Unfortunately, I won't be able to use these pasties. The petal shape does not sit on my breasts very well and the edges won't stay smoothed down, so they are visible through my shirt. :(

I would try them out if you are an A or B cup! The adhesive seems to be very good quality and they seem durable, so I think that these would work well for someone with pretty small breasts. Also the case that they come in is nice.",2
796390,Love the design but the colors on the shirt I received are extremely faded and look nothing like the picture. The shirt size runs a bit small but otherwise seems like a decent thickness and material. Would return it due to the faded color but since it was so cheap and was shipped from China I decided it wasn't worth the hassle,2
523211,This product was very cute but WAYYYYY too small. I used the size chart and then added an additional size. I ordered LargeXX2 and it was like a size 2 or childs size.  I wear a 10. It was shipped directly from China so I don't know how to return it. Awful! Disappointing!,1
625726,"I was a little worried purchasing a size L, but they did say it fit as a US size M. I am a 32DD, and it fits me great. I could even grow a little more when my little one is born and it will be fine. I took the padded inserts out, and there is still a pretty good amount of support for just hanging out at home.",5
524180,"I bought this with my daughter in mind and when I gave it to her, she promptly dumped her stuff out of her other canvas handbag and moved it into this one.  It is made well, durable, sturdy, quality materials and a great size.  Lots of room for lots of things and places to put it all!",5
522033,"Oh, my gosh! My daughter LOVES this dress! Its cute and fun and fits perfect. She is 5ft 100lbs. She will get a lot of wear out of this little dress! The only thing I didn't like was that it took a long time to ship. But that was told up front. I would order this again.",5
121059,"I purchased this hat in multiple colors to stash in different bags. It fits well and is pretty cute. The only drawback? The brim is so wide that it overshadows her face makes it hard to get photos of my kid's face while she's running around outside. (So basically, it works exactly as it should.)",5
774041,"The came as expected it was exactly what I was looking for but it was very small I can wear a large men's shirt or 46 tall I orders a two x it was still tight

776449,"normally i fit into a small or medium size, however, i purchased other shirts from the same company in a medium after reading other review regarding fit and it was a bit to small, wearable, but a tight fit with shorter sleeves. so this time i ordered the large and it's a little big but much more comfortable than the medium i purchased before. these shirts are all great designs and very nice fabric.",5
54040,"There are not many hats on the market to fit a newborn's head (0-6 mos), and this hat mostly does the trick.  The cinch feature allows you to tighten the hat to fit your baby's head, although you may find that it doesn't cinch tight enough for a smaller baby.  Regardless, the chin ties allow the hat to stay in place, and the hat stays on enough to provide the sun protection that you want.  Great buy for the price!",5
81611,"It's got a nice look and feel, and so far, the coin pouch works great. It doesn't close easily when you use all the slots though. There's a windowed slot on the inside that is hard to get a card into, because of the snap rivet, and the dollar compartment is just exactly the length of a dollar, so it's hard to get your bills to lie flat. I'm hoping the latter problem will get better when the leather is stretched out in a few years.",3
163169,"I ordered based on others saying it stretched well, and that they had large legs.  Uh, not workable for me.  I gave them to a more petite friend.. so she got lucky.  I am 5'9"" and sort of an ""Amazon woman"", no pun intended.  I'm overweight, but not morbiedly obese or anything.  SO, I thought this would work.  No, large in the case is maybe someone who is a size 12.  just sayin'",4
838163,"Ordered a XXL in this, I'm a size 12 in pants and the bottoms fit great but I'm a 34C on top and the top does not fit at all. I love the bottoms so much that I'll keep the entire set and find a different top to match with the bottoms.",3
714921,"I gave this 4 stars because I was really hoping it would fit.  The blouse is pretty and the blue is really nice.  My arms didn't fit through.  The width of the arm on the X Large is 10.5"".  I am normally a Large or 10 or 12 in blouses and wear a 38 C  bra, so if you are skinny on the arms and have narrow shoulders an X large might fit.  Too bad, it was a great buy but it's not cut right.",4
410091,"I have rather wide feet.  However, these shoes were so wide, my foot slipped through the front.  I could not wear them.  Unfortunately, it was not until I was enjoying a Carribbean vacation that I realized this sad fact.  I had to wear my good sandals to the pool and beach. I was not happy.",1
192397,"Extremely great product. When I first I got it I thought they were small but they fitted perfectly on my nose. I did have at least one fall out and sometimes it does fill loose, but I don't have my nose pierced I wear it as a fake but it's extremely cute. Just be mindful of wear you place it on your nose.",5
140275,"Although the idea is great, the quality recalled stunk- I guess that is why it was so cheap.  I wouldn't recommend buying this for anyone over the age of 12. The pearl was awkwardly shaped...not round or even oval and had no luster to it at all.

Good for a very young girl to open as a surprise.",1
51026,I would have given zero stars. It didn't fit worth a lick and didn't have instructions in English (not that it's not self explanatory) or in Spanish! It didn't even fit around my super skinny tween niece - so how is it going to fit a new mama who just had a big baby?!? This product was not at all what was described and I ended up returning it ASAP!,1
36650,Amazon as usual delivered.  The umbrella was adorable and my 7 yr old grandaugher loved it!  I leave it in the car so if it is raining when I pick her uop at school I have it handy.  Unfortunately it didn't with stand the Florida heat.  It stuck all together and when she went to open it all the little aluminum posts bent and the umbrella was deemed useless.,3
278973,So my only complaint is that the top is a little shorter than I had hoped however the pants were the PERFECT length. All of my pj pants turn into high waters after one wash but not these! The waist band is tight enough to keep them up but not uncomfortably tight and the fabric is SO soft. Like these is regular fleece soft and then there is this fluffy magic. I wish they came in more style and in mens my boyfriend is very jealous! I got a large my regular size.,5
477502,I purchased these for a costume instead of every day wear outside. I was a female Jon Snow from Game of Thrones. These are very comfortable and fit me well. I have small hands though so they may run small for others. They're fairly good at keeping my hands warm from the outdoor elements. I would not recommend these for rain or snow weather though as they soak up a little water.,5
85847,It is a perfect belt! Nice looking and also fit me well. But I bought an M ( my size for belts is S ) because previous reviews noted that it was smaller than usual. I would say it is of the normal size so M is actually too long for me. Would recommend you to choose your normal size.,5
502928,Ok... this jumper is so unflattering. The bottom shorts totally poof out making it look like your wearing Aladdin's pants in short form. The straps are so short I could hear the seams popping trying to get my arms through them. I rated it a 2 because it's sewn well and is decent fabric. Other then that it'll never be worn.,2
304924,"I liked the cap, scarf, and gloves. The color was nice, and everything fit my 7 yr. old grandson! I believe he will get several years of wear from this set. The cap and gloves will fit ages 4-14, so it was a good purchase! The price was good as well.",4
4726,"After nearly two months my two automatic watches are ticking happily away. The mechanism is very quiet and the winder looks tidy.

The only critisism I have is lack of instructions to mount the watches. Maybe all winders work the same way but this was my first experience with wone and it took a while to work out the watch mounts are spring loaded to accept teh watch band. Once I sorted that out - no problems",4
577129,"I love these Freya bathing suits.  I can get a perfect fit, I own 2 others.  I did order both the bikini bottom and hipster shorts (in XS) and they fit great.  Real incentive to step up that exercise program.  The gold pinstripe and the gold accents really make this a different ""little black bathing suit.""  Don't say there is no such thing, well there should be. Very rich looking, can't wait to accessorize- yes I do that too.

Kiki",5
567859,This is really a great belt.  The ratchet allows adjustment to my exact waist size instead of hoping to find the right holes in a standard style belt.  It is secure and snug so I do not have to re-adjust during the day.  I liked it so much that I bought a second one in brown.,5
110979,"You get what you pay for.
Will I return it? No
Would I have bought it if I had touched it first? No

I would use it for public swimming outings.  At home, I prefer plush bathrobes.  Hooded robes are difficult to find and I jumped on this for the price. If you don't mind wearing average robes, then you will love this.  If you like plush soft, cushy robes then you will be dissapointed.",3
879061,Mine was defective but so stinking cute I am getting another and hoping it was just a fault in the one case. I would t fit snuggley with my phone and yes I check the size . Will change the stars and edit review if new one comes back as hoping!!,1
151017,"Bought them for winter because I wanted ravenclaw stuff. Within a few months of occasional wear, the stitching of the waistline is tearing and falling apart so much. I'm a bigger guy, so maybe it's not entirely the pants fault. They're also pretty thin. Worth it for ravenclaw, but not a long term answer to anything.",3
324296,"Very cute when pulled out of the bag, extremely comfortable to wear. However, I wore it once and didn't even make it through the day before the sleeves started ripping on the inseams. Very poorly made. Wouldn't recommend to buy at all unless you don't mind wearing it once and then throwing it out. Returned the shirt immediately. Very disappointed because I was so excited about the shirt, and couldn't wait to wear it.",2
611161,"Fit was small. I bought a larger size, but as the fabric has no stretch, the top is tight in the chest. It also has black marks on the left shoulder that look like someone dropped a permanent marker on it. This has not washed out. Not worth the cost to return. I have worn it once or twice with a scarf to cover the black marks.",2
195072,"Beautiful PeacockNecklace. Lot's of complements and so many beautiful colors to go with a lot of different out fits. Light weight not heavy at all. I did buy chain extensions cause at times I want a longer necklace, and other times I want a shorter chain. This one comes with a shorter chain, but I was still very happy I bought this item. 5 stars for me all the way.",5
328744,I bought this for my husband and I hoped it would of got here on Christmas. Sadly 3 days before christmas he has to have surgery but he is doing great. We check our mail on chrismas day and I see the box. At the point I get all excited. It arrived ealrier than it should of and he opens it and his face was priceless. He is a big fallout fan he loved it. We got the pocket watch and the pendant. Thank you so much we love it!,5
681759,I wore it for my baby shower!!! I enjoyed it. Exactly as shown in the picture. Just that it was a little bit tight from the belt portion but that was because I was 8 months pregnant. ordered a medium and I am usually a small size. Also the dress is completely white so it definitely was a bit see-through.,4

292062,"These badges were adorable. As a gift to my boyfriend, they were really nice. However, I will say that when they arrived, the inside of the box seemed to be coated in dust. I had to clean some of the badges off and twist them to be oriented properly. For what I paid, it was amazing quality. However, it seems a bit unprofessional for the INSIDE of the box to be uncleanly. Still, it's not a huge complaint, and if I needed something like this again, I would definitely re-purchase.",4
339299,This is exactly what i was looking for. Definitely happy about the feel and look of these. My favorite part is how this makes my butt look with the opening in the back. Very happy with this product and the speed at which it reached me! The shipping is fast as well.,5
740215,"This sweater is super cute and soft, BUT IT'S SUPER LARGE. I'm usually a medium in almost everything, so I ordered a medium. However, the neck was so big, it was like it was trying to be an off-shoulder sweater. It would be comfortable if it wasn't for the neck.",4

I wish i could return and get my money back but it's too late. I do not recommend this for anyone. The binding isn't very good. If you were to get it, get a size up, that's what i did. The fit was fine but everything else was just awful.",1

No adjustment needed and not as snug as the jumpsuit on the model in the pic. I prefer the very slightly extra room for comfort. Pair with heels for a chic look or timberland boots for a more rugged look. Light cotton, so can be worn in summer, spring and fall.",5
767513,This is an excellent product.  Excellent quality!!!!!  This includes ALL of the nylon straps that I have purchased from this Company.  I have used them to replace many of the leather watch straps (on many of the watches) in my watch collection.  They add an enhanced and fresh look to the watch while making the watch more comfortable to wear by eliminating the weight.  I will be buying more to these straps in the future......,5

I'm 5'6'', 118 lbs, so I'm not super big or little. If you like your sweatshirts big and loose like I do, then this isn't like that. The sleeves are kinda short too, so you may just wanna roll em up.",4

491337,"I was really excited when I got these in the mail, but when I opened the box I was kind of disappointed to see that they sowed the leather at the tip of the shoes instead of hiding it on one side. Other than that I think the shoes are okay, they are comfortable to walk in.",3
494915,"Loved these shoes when they arrived.  So much so that I couldn't wait to wear them to work.  Unfortunately I only made it about a quarter of my work day before the stitching started to unravel and the shoe started to pretty much fall off my foot.  I know Keds aren't the most rugged of shoes but I still feel as if ""more than a couple hours"" is a reasonable expectation for durability.",1

There is a goldish/bronze colored chain that dangles just below the brim on the backside of the hat that is attached to the band (not viewable in the photo).  That chain gives the hat the Steampunk look, as does the metal rings affixed to the band.  I dig it!",4

Some of the stones seem clear but some of them look very yellow. I'm returning this to Target store tomorrow.,2
566254,"My son had to be a Billy Goat Gruff for school and I modified it to be part of the costume.  It was a good fit for his head, just a tiny bit loose in it's original state.  I'm not sure this would fit most adult males though since it fits me and my 5 year old.",5
748301,"This is a lightweight gauzy generously sized 2-layer dress that can be worn alone or with a longer skirt or pants. I ordered the size 18 and I'm 5'.5"" and usually wear a US size 16-18 in dresses. I like my clothes loose and this dress fits me just like the model in the photo.",5
260259,"This is  a beautiful piece of material, very soft, very sheer and with mind-boggling art. It can be worn with jeans, with dress pants, with skirt...or without any other piece of clothing. *cough* Please do not wear in public without other clothing. It might take a while for it to be reported, but eventually someone will call the cops on you.

Also, you could slit the seams and revamp it into a nice neck wrap, it looks to be versatile. Oh, and it would make for a great swim suit cover!",5
317574,"Beautiful skirt - if you are on the fence, order it! The only thing that I don't like is that the top row does not have a ""finished"" look to it. The ends of the feathers are exposed and makes it look cheaper. If you have a belt to wear over it or can sew another row of these types of feathers on it with a finished band over it, it would be ideal.",4
459203,Most comfortable boots I own.  I usually wear between a 7.5 and an 8 so I purchased the 8.  They run big for an 8 but I wear fuzzy socks with them and they are fine. I love how they come up higher than most combat boots! They look cute with everything!,5
824540,I sized up with this bathing suit and it still was too small. I contacted the manufacturer to have it sent back it said they would get back to me but never did. These suits claim to be for plus sizes but are most definitely not I'm very unhappy with this product.,1
159472,I have owned to of these cases which came with my Ray Ban sunglasses and BOTH of them tore at the snap. The fake leather they use for these becomes very brittle when it gets a little colder which means that when you go to open the case normally the 'leather' tears right at the snap.,1
312330,"I love these shoes so much that  I reordered another pair online. It's hard to find shoes that fit my really wide feet! The heel back is my favorite part on them, they're thin and feel like another layer of skin, not bulky or tight at all.  I walked all over Europe in these!",5
361531,"I'm 5'5"", 147lbs 34C and ordered a large in black because I read other reviews saying it ran small. It's too big for me. With the drawstring pulled all the way there's just too much extra fabric draping. I'll be returning & may try a medium. The black is not see through. Nice fabric, really cute casual dress",4
503249,Wish these came in a better color/size assortment. It was tuff to find solid colors. My girls wear these under their dresses as where they live it is chilly in morning. That way they can  take them off if it warms up.  They should make solid shorts in same thin fabric for girls to wear under all dresses.  Kinda like the petticoat from the old days.,4
434121,"I bought these for a Halloween costume, so I knew I would only be wearing once.  I love the zipper details.  I would comment that the fabric is not really ""faux leather"".  It is a polyester fabric that just has some ""sheen"" to it.

Also, I bought the Small and am 5'7"" 125lbs.  They were SUPER tight, but I managed to wear them for my Halloween costume.  Definitely should have gotten the Medium, though.",4
171397,"I've been waiting for this corset for about 2 weeks and when it arrived I was thrilled. It took a while to get into but the fitting is just perfect I received a small and I love it , can't wait to see the results.  Material is great and allows little movement unlike straight steel rods",5
384142,"These are the perfect size for my septum piercing. I never have to flip up, though, because my piercing is unnaturally high up in my nose. These may show on someone who has a lower piercing than I do. But I love these little retainers. I can breathe! And without the hassle of flipping a horseshoe ring up in my nose. A much more comfortable experience.",5
353528,"Great leather shoe laces. They seem to be heavy duty and are long enough to cut to size for any boot. I cut a single 72"" lace in half and made a pair for my boat shoes. Nice and flexible leather that doesn't have to be broken in and treated before you can tie a knot that will stay tied. I recommend them highly",5
510057,"This is a very cute hat, wear it at the beach or a trip is good, I like it very much, but my head is too small to stay in the hat, and I decided to take it as a gift to other friends, Also I think it is more suitable for light skin ladies! It will be very attractive!",4
189935,"This necklace is very pretty and will be a striking piece with brightly colored (or white) outfits.  I am taking care to treat it carefully  because of other reviews, but you can't beat the price, and I am pretty conservative with my jewelry.  It came in perfect condition.",5
507790,"I received a discount on this product for my honest review. It's a cute bathing suit. Came quickly, and was packaged nicely. The bathing suit is strong and the material is not too thin. My daughter ordered this it runs a bit on the large side. So, she will keep it for next year. The buttons on the front are strongly secured and for the cost, it was worth the order.",4
741900,"This item was perfect!  It is so comfortable and adorable.  From the day I ordered my shirt to the day it arrived was a mere 5 days. The shirt does run big. I should have ordered a size smaller, but it does make for a comfortable relaxed fit shirt.",5
110797,"Its very cute but you get what you pay for.  As the price was awesome, the quality was not.  I've had it for 2 days and it already broke.  Its fixable, but don't expect durability with this piece.  I love the way it looks, so its definitely worth the cheap material.  All ya need to do is put a better, more durable chain on it and you'll get your moneys worth.",4
70767,"Im an LPN, working on a Rehabilitation Unit, 8 hour shifts. It has helped my tired legs during the day. I wore it for the first time today and it has been a blessing. I normally do sit due to the not stop interruptions and my legs feel really good. I tried it out to see if they would help when wore them to my clinical fro the RN program. If you have not bought grab them, they are amazing!!!",5
851462,"i'm returning this.  i'm short (5' tall) and this is just too much fabric on such a short frame.  i ordered a small and a medium.  the small is better but the  arms are quite tight, and still too much fabric around the torso/hips for me to be able to pull it off.  i could see this looking nice on someone considerably taller.  sweater was soft and the colors were nice.  quality seemed good too.",2
633969,"Too small, cannot wear it at all. I am a Medium US size, I am tall and slim and I ordered a Large just in case, however, when arrived it fit as if it was a XS-Small size!  I ordered Nude color and it also looks more like pink. Really disappointed, I had planned on wearing it to an event, now I can't.",1
398897,"Usually when I see something like this I think, ""yeah right.  That's never going to work."" But these little ponies really do work as advertised.  I don't know how they do the heating thing, it's like magic or something (but nothing satantic or witchcraft, more like white magic).  Plus, the design is really cute.  If you have cold hands, or even just cool hands, I really recommend this product.",5
621489,I normally don't like to show off my stomach but this crop top is perfect! It goes perfect with high waisted shorts and I just can express how cute it is :). I would get a size up from what you are. I'm normally a small but I got a medium to be safe :). And it fits perfectly!! I'm 5'4 and 124 pounds .,5
500617,I ordered this after ordering it from someone else for 10 cents I rebought from yall for $10 because your picture makes it look thicker but it came in the mail and was exactly the same one so basically I just wasted the money and now to return it I have to pay more so bad review for bad picture description should say something about how thin and bendable it is,1
273625,"I purchased this for my 14 year old daughter for a possible costume mask for Halloween.  Her and I both absolutely adore it!!!  It's so cute that she plans to hang it on her bedroom wall after Halloween.  I am super pleased with the price, quality and quick delivery.",5
301858,"I pulled these out of the packaging and I looked at the waist and feared they would be too small. I tried them on and was blown away!  These have quickly become my favorite leggins.  The elastic on the waist is very flattering on my belly (6 months postpartum from a C-section) and comfortable.  The Grey pants are NOT thin or see-through at all.  I added a black pair to my wish list as I don't know I'll ever be able to wear my existing black leggins, after wearing the grey ones.",5
251601,"I have a smaller chest and this fit me perfectly covering all. If you have a larger chest it would still fit nicely just show a little more.
The material is soft and silky which is comfortable but does cause the hood to slip off easily.
I bought this for a costume and wore over a tank, but definitely plan on wearing to a rave!",5
250118,"SO CUTE!!! Much cuter in person :) and my 2.5 year old LOVES it!  My only issue with it is the quality.  It's a very light weight fleece material and the cuffs of the sleeves are very cheaply done, just a couple lines of stitching, no real cuffs.  It'll be good for early evenings in Spring & Fall at Disneyland, but I'd definitely have a thicker sweatshirt ready to layer under this...it may be ok for cool Summer nights but definitely not enough for Winter.",4
126287,"Love it! I stopped carrying around a purse because of shoulder pains and didn't want to carry a lot in my hand when running errands. This hold my cards, my money, and my keys which is perfect. It's not bulky and seems to be made out of a strong enough material to last a long time.",5
176840,Very cute I love red and this is really prettier in person and I also like the fact that Yazilind has such an awesome selection and its so affordable...... I am able to have one to match each outfit! Although it takes a while for shipping its worth the wait!,5
223942,I actually did not see any problem what so ever with this Vera Bradly Small Trimmed Purse. Someone mentioned the bottom was bent in shipping and did not stand upright. All you gotta do is bend it in the opposite direction and the bag sits upright just fine. I love the 6 individual pockets on the inside. Perfect for easy access. The quality is nice and the purse is lightweight. Love this tote !,5
349275,Spikes blue one fits well and clips on easily. Very pretty as well! The only thing is that it's longer than I anticipated and kind of loose. The lacey one was super long and loose and hard to clip on and off. Didn't take a pic with it b/c I didn't really like it,2
432532,"I had not worn a tux since my son's wedding some 20 years ago and needed one for a gala during a recent trip to India, so I did not want to spend an arm and a leg. This one survived the trip nicely, fits like a glove and looks great. The finishing is also good and I could detect no flaws. But the material is polyester, and that explains the modest price. This tux served my purpose perfectly; I might even wear it again if the occasion arises.",4
635497,"Lace top is stretchy, so no problem putting on. Shipping took about three weeks. Only complaint is that lace part on the neck and the arms look kind of undone because it looks as if they just cut the fabric and left it. But I will be wearing it under jacket so it will be okay. I did hand wash it in lukewarm water and it was okay. I normally wear XS and I ordered a L and it fits nice on me.",4
520023,"Ordered Large for my daughter who wears 5/6.  Fit perfect.  Good quality and soft.  Very pleased with the purchase.  Just expect a longer shipping time.  I didn't expect it to come from Korea as we like to purchase products made in the usa BUT it was my fault for not looking closer.  I don't like cheap, thin, scratchy underwear for my children and these certainly are nice and soft.",5
174936,Fast shipping and great help from them. The heart is painted on poorly that is the reason for the 4 star but the shipping was great and return is easy. BEWARE THE RING MAY BE TO BIG WHEN ORDERED I HAD TO ORDER A SIZE DOWN DUE TO IT BEING SO BIG! But other then that it was great.,4
393773,"I was really excited to try these because my old job required long periods of sitting and my feet and ankles swelled so bad.  These socks worked for that.  The problem was that they cut off circulation.  Because it hurt so badly, I stopped wearing them.  Was super bummed. :(",3
304980,"The second I put it on the strap broke -_- and I have a small head. Once that was fixed... It was the most unique mask on Burbon St Halloween night in New Orleans. Not another like it anywhere. That made me happy. People, Mardi gras is not the day of the dead -_-",3
99531,"I love it! Thank you! It was a great deal and is a wonderful stylish hand bag!
I was looking for something for fall, something that would hold all of the contents of my purse as well as things from my son's diaper bag, and this was exactly what I needed! I am delighted with it!",5
219225,I love my corset! It fits as I expected it to and it's great. The front closures are awesome and the way it ties in the back is super sturdy. The only issue I have with it is that the bottom part of it sticks out kinda far and gives me an unnecessary  pooch.,4
87775,"Keep in mind the price when purchasing..it is a thin material but mostly all allegra k products are. Mine came with the belt, I read some didn't I guess I got lucky lol . It's super cute I dnt mind it being thin because summers in Texas are super super hot so thin is gd :) I'm 5'2 and it is short jst like it looks in the picture. Overall I think its a great dress for 10$",4
349375,"I've been thinking about getting my septum pierced so I ordered this to see how it looks and if I like it. It fits nice and doesn't bother me, It's a really cute design and I really like it and it stays put, haven't had a problem with it falling out. Overall I really like this product",5
674049,"This is the most fantastic purchase! Literally never been happier with an online purchas. I loved the dress so much I bought two more, the flowers and the coffee. I get compliments left and right each and every time I wear these amazingly comfortable dresses. 5 stars highly recommend they are my favorites! ",5
120476,"Ordered these for my grandson who is 1 year old and weighs 22 lbs. I read the reviews that said to order size larger so that's what I did and they fit perfect with room to grow. He normally wears a size 12 months so I bought 18-24 month size, and they are adorable and great for the pool. My DIL loves them.",5
786058,I bought this for my daughter who takes gymnastics and she LOVED it. It is a beautiful color and it fits her perfectly even though she is a bit petite for her age. The only gripe I had was that the skirt kept coming off and had to be retied several times so I wouldn't recommend it for gymnastics unless you are planning on sewing it on as I plan to do.,5
272917,"Really dull needles. The clamps had an extra small piece of plastic that I didn't notice until it was too late. I tried to pierce my septum with this but the needle wouldn't go through because of the extra plastic bit. So I ended up with a nearly pierced but bloody septum for absolutely nothing
**** bought some metal clamps and redid my septum after it healed and it went through perfectly! I also pierced my nipples a week ago and everything went smoothly.",5
282919,Tops not appropriate for any one over a d cup but I love the suite and bottoms are awesome I bought a very similar top that fit better and kept the bottoms. Im a 16 and bottoms 4x fit good 40d/dd cup and 5x top was still to small.  (I ordered 2 sizes) Ordered a 40d top from a major plus size store and it fit well. (LB),4
626151,Do not buy this! I could tell when I opened this it was poorly made. Doesn't even look like the picture at all. I am disappointed that Amazon allows this crap that's clearly made in China probably by child labor to be peddled on its website. It doesn't look anything like the picture. I would have rated it lower or even given a negative rating if I could have. Do not buy!,1
404070,"The vest arrived and I loved how it looked, until I realized that only the front is wool. The back is a different fabric of a different color. The vest is nice, but a backside picture in the description would have been really helpful to accurately describe the vest. It was disappointing.",2
719358,"Ordered the US X-Large and was sent Asian XX-Large.  Shirts fit fine as a cycling shirt (just a little tighter than a T-Shirt).  I am satisfied with the fit at the Asian xx-Large.  By the detail in the ad, the supplier is trying to get you the right size the first time which I appreciate.  Nice shirt.",5
574132,"I own other pieces of jewelry by Carolyn Pollack, so thought this would be great as well.  Disappointed since picture not a good representation of ring.  Too high and sides look squashed in.  I thought it was defective but realized it was the design. Not for me. Returned for a refund.",2
778249,"As a fan of the original series thru the  almost franchise killing Voyager and Enterprise, I have another tie I am proud to wear to church and other stately functions.

I chose the Commander Yellow, version because why not.

The tie is everything I hoped it would be, it is put together well, it is 2.5 inches at the widest.  Almost barely wide enough (at the appropriate place)  to fit the Star Fleet tie clasp that I have to go with it.",5
329649,"Received every pair, the only thing I didn't like is that the white ones which is my preferred color for plugs are not perfectly round, the flares are cut slightly uneven, that's why they're so inexpensive, but they do seem like good quality.

Edited Review: The ""clear"" ones aren't really clear they're more of an opaque, which doesn't really blend well with the skin in my opinion. I recommend Kaos earskins for a true clear. But again 3 pair's for $11 vs. $20 for a pair of kaos is really inexpensive",4
592857,"I just receive this in the mail yesterday and surprised it was shipped sooner than expected. I actually went with an XL which ends up fitting me perfectly. I am 5'1,  weigh 119 my waist measurement is about 28 and bust is 34. I cannot wait until it gets a bit warmer to wear it without leggings. It's a summer MUST HAVE!",5
796777,"I love this. It is comfortable, easy to wear, loose and flowing.  I felt very regal whilst wearing it.  When I wore it in public for the first time recently, loads of people commented and said they loved the style and colour. Have yet to wear the red version of the same which I also purchased, but feel sure the compliments will come flooding in there too!",5
824979,"Pretty but cheaply made.  Broke on the first use.  No, it was not mishandled, it was not sit on top to close, it was just a bump and the luggage cracked.  Not durable at all.  Save the money and buy something with a bit more resistance and durability.",1
833460,The dress looked very pretty and the lace-up back helped get a good fit but the length from top of the shoulder to bust was definitely off. The dress was plenty long total (touched the ground on someone 5'10) but the bust was too short so I had to return. Would not reccommend for anyone with a long torso but otherwise it's beautiful and it's a great value.,3
316268,"I agree 100% with reviewer ispringer. These don't fit at all like my other PJJ's... Waist too big, legs too tight. Also, these have either been worn, or the stitching is defective at the drawstring (one of the holes is bigger and looks torn). These will be going back. The color and fabric are nice though, if only they fit true to size.",2
429572,"Great value for the price. I bought these because of the screw on backs. They work great. They keep the earrings on tight. The diamonds also look great. Up close you can see some imperfections but wearing the earrings, you can't notice those. Plus no diamond is technically flawless. The quality of these diamonds are great for the price. They also shine pretty good.",5
655980,"Bought this for my significant other on a whim. She's a shorty so it was a tiny bit long...
She looked stunning in it!
Has nice built in cups, so no need for a bra and nothing was falling out.
Has a built in slip.
The material is a little heavy, so the dress lays nicely and had a little extra warmth for the winter wear.",5
91831,"I bought this to wear to a Rocky Horror Midnight Showing. The bottom half fit fine. The top part was so loose that it made me look frumpy, even after I clipped the back. However, I still got compliments on my costume. I probably won't be able to wear it again because the apron fell apart after about an hour. It's not sewn well.",2
343950,"My son was very happy with his watch when he got it.  He especially liked the different background colors for the light.  But by the third day of normal wear, the face was fogged up.  The condensation got gradually worse until a week later it stopped working all together.  I would not recommend this to anyone.",1
136377,"Let's face it... if you wear glasses and are looking for sunglasses to go over them you will look like a dork. These are the least dorky ""fit-over sunglasses"" that I have ever come across. Some might even say that they are the exception to the rule. I bought a pair, and when i tried them on i immediately bought another pair. I wish they would develop a choice in lens colors.",4
381754,I love my new Pineapple iPhone 6 case!  It's super cute and fits the phone well.  My only criticism is that the hole for charging port is a little small for some of my chargers.... but that's not enough of an issue for me to give it anything less than 5 stars!,5
162890,The design of the bag is nice and its a perfect size. The price wasn't expensive so you get what you pay for in this case. The quality is cheap and the gold studs/rivets are not shiny. They are very dull. The packaging was horrible. It was sent in an envelope so from being smashed it has a permanent crease in it.,2
722334,"Purchased for family pictures. Nice colors. Does snag somewhat easily but not an item I expect to last for years either. Has a little more body and volume than my other blanket scarves. Not sure if this would change with washing. I did need to air it out on arrival but then it was fine. Overall, I am happy with my purchase and would recommend.",5
712227,"So soft.  Love it in the cool weather.  I usually wear a small but ordered a M (Asian L).  It fits over two thin layers (tank and tshirt) comfortably. I live in the California bay area so it doesn't get cold cold, but with a vest on top I'm good to go. I ordered it in every color available.",5
356447,"The material is awful, it's plastic-y feeling. The buttons are not wood, they're this horrible orange colored plastic. Do not waste your money, this shirt feels like it's made of PVC and is extremely cheap. The fit was wrong too, my boyfriend is usually a Men's medium and this was extremely baggy on him.",1
334506,"I have been looking for a front wallet case for a long time. I have tried magnetic ones, and elastic ones, and leather ones, and they all fail eventually. I like this style cause it keep a very low profile form factor, and also keeps my cards secure so i know they won't just fall out. Love it. I only wish for a gray color one.",5
44410,"My daughter got these boots for her Cosplay outfit for the convention coming up. She has not had a chance to wear them long term yet so cannot really say how long they can be worn comfortably. But I can tell you that they look adorable on her, fit as expected and she says they feel comfortable to wear. They came on time.",5
591511,"The veil is of nice quality.  It was very secure on the comb (I know this because I wanted to remove the comb and it took some time).  It was a little longer than I expected since it is for my 7 year old'a First Holy Communion, but I can sew so I was able to alter it.  Overall, it was a good purchase.",4
15217,"I was diagnosed  with Plantar issues begining with heel pain.  Bought this product because I did not want to spend hundreds for othodics from my doctor.  After a few weeks of icing and wearing these inserts,  I am much better.  The key is arch support for heel issues.  I bought other inserts as well and I will give my opinion on them as well.  Overall I spent about 90 bucks on 3 different brands and I am very happy as I saved at least 300 bucks.",4
844405,"Exactly what i was looking for ! Well made and very sturdy .Just received it today so the test of time will tell, but from the quality i'm sure it will hold up well. I choose the color black. Very minimalists and fairly thin. I have no complaints as of yet. Cards and bills fit just fine and are easy to access ... Bravo Ikepod ! You hit a homerun with this fabulous wallet. I",5
15429,"Got this because of the good reviews and the cost which is about half of the Lynco's I picked up on the internet. My original first thought is that the Powersteps were much stiffer than the Lynco's, but so far there doesn't seem to be any real difference. At any rate, it seems to help me get around on a partially torn achilles until the doctors figure out what to do next.",4
714320,Just received these and I like them. The sizing is perfect which has been a slight issue in the past for me with stone plugs. The biggest disappointment with these is that the Howlite plugs don't have dramatic black veining throughout like the image but they are still good looking. The Tiger's Eye and Jade look amazing.,4
882124,"Loved the lightweight flowing fabric.  The color was even and rich.  It is a dress that keeps me cool  even in tropical weather.  I thought it might be a little clingy in humid weather but it remains cool and free flowing.  The wide base is not as evident in the photo but the generous amount of fabric creates a flattering, flattering flare that hides the bumps I like to keep hidden.  I would recommend this product",4
708339,"This came directly from China and took a while to get here.  The fabric is a bit thin and coarse, and it still smells like chemicals after washing, but it does look cute on.  The fit is a tiny bit small - especially shoulders and chest.  I don't have much to write home about in the boob area, but for someone who does, it may be snug and tight.  It's a good shirt, not a great shirt.",4
804961,I am very disappointed in this shirt I'm glad I got a medium and not a small because it medium fits like a small and it's still a little tight and it is not the same color it's very cheaply made. I wanted it because I thought it would look like that one and it's blue not teal period and it is not a sweater it's made out of thin t-shirt material,1
362026,"Our family of 5 used this for a recent cruise we went on.  It fit our passports, plane tickets, cruise check in paperwork, etc.  I loved the zip closure for cash and the removable keychain.  Everything stayed organized and made traveling so much easier.  This was is a great purchase!",5
506314,"The product was unusually disproportionate. The arms are just right more on the snug side but the body is huge. I bought 2xl. I'm 5'11"" weigh 195 lbs. The arms are tight but the body section can fit two of me. Tried to return it but the size down cost way more. Gifted to a bigger friend his body fits but arms don't. Waste of money. You guys should sell the size down for same price. I would've been ok. The material was very confortable.",3
325381,"Bought for wife, she says: ""I am 5'8"" 220, 42 inch bust, 14-15"" bicep, and ,17 - 18"" shoulders and this fits awesome. I love that it is reversible like getting 2 jackets for the price of one! Seems well made, and is completely finished on both sides. So either way you wear it, it looks very good. Get lots of complements when I wear it. Am very glad I found it. Perfect for summer time. I ordered the XXL.""",5
876792,Great dress for the price. Very comfortable. Very fitted. Only complaint was it was a bit hard to get on and off because so fitted. Wore to a holiday party and receive several compliments. I washed it today and it held up well in the wash. Very happy with this purchase.,5
421407,"Bought for my husband, and he absolutely loves it. He previously had one and after a couple of years it finally started breaking.. after a couple of searches I came across this Batman one. Glad I ordered it. My husband has had it on since the day it came in.
He loves the quick release. He's a manager at Walmart so having quick access to his work keys are a must.",5
525407,I absolutely love LOCS. I bought a pair of white ones about a year ago and the lasted a long time until they broke in a freak accident. I absolutely love the sunglasses. It is fantastic quality for a very good and cheap price. I highly recommend these glasses to anyone and everyone.,5
802307,"I really want to love this suit because the style is adorable and the color is vibrant but it is cheaply made, unfortunately. The hooks that attach the straps on the top are made of plastic and the eye where the hook attaches isn't sewn correctly so it doesn't even attach securely. The bow also isn't sewn on very well. Just a fair warning, as well, this is definitely not for a petite 3 year old. It runs large. ((My daughter is 3 years old, just shy of 30lbs and is 36"" tall, for reference.))",3
29496,"Really poor quality. The cheap foam(armor plates) bend real easily and look cheap and fake. It fastens in the back with a tiny square of velcro that does not hold. I had to go buy safety pins to hold it closed.  The mask is the worst! Two seperate, cheap pieces of plastic that is held together with small patches of velcro that does not hold the mask together very well, not to mention it arrived flattened. Really not worth what they charge for the costume.",2
340911,"These were great leggings that I got for my daughter.  She's about 5'2"" and medium build.  They had plenty of room and were not tight and thin at all.  They were a little long on her, but were well fitted so they didn't bunch up in lose rolls or anything like that.  They were perfect for her Halloween costume---a fox!  I would buy these leggings again.  They would probably be stretched somewhat thin on a plus-sized person (size 16+).  My daughter wears a size 10 in jeans and there was plenty of room.",5
591153,"It doesn't come with the pocket clip on the chain, which was rather troublesome. It instead comes with a lobster clip like a necklace. It's very light and somewhat small but seems to be well made. The box is simple and the foam inside of it protects the watch well. There are clear covers on the undecorated parts. All in all, very nice collector/cosplay piece.",4
431797,"These bags are multi purpose.  I use one for cosmetics, etc. when I travel.  I use another for all my sewing notions and keep it with my machine.  I bought an extra because I am sure I will come up with another use for it!  After seeing mine all my sewing friends had to have one too.",5
315416,"Dress looked way prettier on line than it did in person. It arrived with a tear in the tulle (and it didn't even look like tulle skirt in the picture) Sizing was odd (too large!) and the whole dress looked cheaply made. Very disappointing. However, it arrived promptly and the seller was cooperative about everything.",2
69951,"I love rimless glasses. I've had plenty of them, which became loose and eventually had to be discarded. I was determined to keep searching until I found rimless sunglass that were attractive and strong at the same time. I found Kenneth Cole Reaction KC1038 Brown Rimless. I absolutely love them! I'm thinking about getting a backups,  just incase I lose the ones I have. Yes, I would definitely recommend them to my friends.",5
825561,"While the anklet is very nice quality and beautiful, I believe mine was broken. The second chain with the beads was only attached on one end so the other side was hanging off. I decided to just take off the second chain all the way instead of returning it because it still looked fine.",3
410267,"Super cute wallet. I bought it to match a bag and really like it. The only thing about it is that its a little off in the overall capacity. If you have credit cards in it you can't carry much else or it won't stay snapped, but it is well made...just can't pack it.",4
412463,"Ordered a green choker and received a white sequined one without any jewel. Definitely not green. Not only that, but it clasps with velcro and one side of the velcro came undone when I tried it on for the first time so now it's completely useless. Didn't pay $10 w/ shipping to get something broken & not the color I ordered. Let alone no jewel on it?",1
751292,"So. Very very comfortable.  The cotton is great.  The only problem with these briefs when you wear them, there's not much room for your package.  I'm not sure if they are designed to have your package to the side or up but I like to point down and it's a bit tight.  Love the style though for sure and some nice looks from people in the gym and spa",4
87967,I am so bummed. The only thing it said it didn't come with was the headband-it doesn't come with a dang chemise-damn it. My party is in 3 weeks and I have to order an additional part! Thanks for not clearly stating that I needed an additional piece. I normally spend 3x this amount of $ but I thought I would try this for my theme. Needless to say it is a mistake I will never do again.,1
705986,"If I didn't know better, I would think this came from Nordstrom or Saks. It's 100% polyester, but the quality is that of a high-end luxury store. It's fully lined and crafted perfectly. The only semi-cons are that the cuffs are loose and the pockets could be real. Also, I am large chested so ordered the XL, but the waist is loose. It would be more flattering if the waist was smaller. I might see if I can get it altered.",4
699986,"I never got to wear it, when I tired it on the cheap zipper popped and it costs more than the dress to replace a zipper... what a bunch of crap I am sad because it is super adorable but tight in the chest, if you have small boobs it will fit perfect and true to size but if you have a larger chest you need to order a size up",2
537458,"When I initially tried these coveralls on they fit ok. However, after I washed them and put them in the drier they shrank about 4 inches. They now look like coolot. I washed them in cold water permanent press, as I do all my dark clothes and used the permanent press cycle for the dryer.",2
661072,"Great ties for the price. Packaging was amazing to keep them nice rather than a jumbled mess when you get it. Love the colors and exactly as they look in pics. Only thing I struggle with is the tail does not tapper in size much, which makes it sometimes difficult to hide behind the front of the tie while wearing.",4
267736,This clip is just what I was looking for.  I needed it to clip the back of a delicate blouse.  It works and looks great for what I need.  The clip is very pretty - black and white lace/vintage feel.  I am very pleased with my purchase.,5
507139,"The bathing suit is beautiful.  Unfortunately, it is by no means ""stretchy"" like a bathing suit normally would be.  It is quite fitted considering it's purpose, and can be very unflattering because of it.  I altered the top of the suit myself to make it fit more comfortably, so it isn't a total loss.  However I can't say I'll order again. :/",3
762345,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this sweet Eiffel Tower. The detail is amazing, considering the size...The size is perfect - not too small (doesn't leave you wondering what it is), nor is it too big/bulky to wear...just a sweet bit of detailed sparkle around your neck. The chain it came with is also made well and compliments the tower perfectly. It has enough weight to it to suggest a very fine piece of jewelry. I bought this for my 10 year old granddaughter, but I would gladly wear it. This piece also lays nicely against the skin.",5
549516,"Cute logo, especially the dot of the i being a bear. Kinda cheapish in quality, but it's a tank top so......
Runs small. Order 1 size up for sure !! I'm 5-4 130lbs, had to return my medium for a large. Large fits good, and they were fast with the exchange.",3
695399,"I really like this dress. I am 5'4 and typically wear XL/1X so I ordered this dress in a 2X Coral for a wedding. It is a bit snug and I do feel the coral is more of a peach but overall I really like it. The cinched waist, paired with a petticoat really helps hide my dreadful mommy belly. I am large chested, D cup, and the chest area is really snug. I don't think a DD cup would fit.",4
521061,"Be careful the description seems to change daily on the size.  When I purchased it said fit US size 4-10 (still says that in my order history). Now it says US 4-6 UK 10.  So sadly being a US size 8 it was a little snugger than I was comfortable with.  I ended up giving it away.

Everything else was great shipped quickly and even arrived earlier than expected.  Just wish it fit!",3
580789,Ordered this vest. Couldn't wait on it to come in. Once I got it I was very disappointed. I ordered a men's large slim fit. Or so they claimed. What I received was what said to be a xxl. This vest fits my 8 year old son.... Maybe I should have considered a different size had I known that I was ordering from tiny Asians!,1
846672,"I purchased this item a while ago, seeing that it usually runs small I went a size up and bought a medium since I am usually a small in tops. It looked very cute when I got it, but when I tried it on it was extremely small. For someone who usually wears an extra small/ small in tops, I would probably need an XL for it to fit ok.",1
379543,"Just got this today and I love it! It fits great and the color is nice and vibrant. I got a size large and I'm a 38C/150lbs/5'1"" and this tank fits perfectly. Not too snug, not too loose, not too short, not too long. I'm going to order more in different colors ASAP!",5
198038,I got the swim suit for my girlfriend and ill be honest i was afraid of getting a size that won't fit because i usually get the wong size when i order online. But this item fits very well for her and she likes it too its and good thick material. Really like this item and will look for more from you guys.,5
426786,These are definitely long - more of a men's cut than a women's cut.  I will wear around the house or keep until my son grows into them.  I ordered the wrong size and received the replacement very quickly and with no hassle.  Customer service is great.,4
4764,I read the reviews on this and don't have ANY of the problems noted.  They are simple to put into a boot and then hold them up perfectly.  If you try to fuss with them too much I guess they could cause problems....but I haven't had an issues myself.,5
486342,"Took awhile to get to me, but it was worth the wait. I got this as a gift and the person who received it, loved it. It works well, and is rather accurate on time. The only thing I don't like about it is the fact that you have to hold it open in order to check the time, and it snaps closed fast if your finger slips. All in all though: I do recommend.",5
849675,Fit small it's based on European size people so go a size bigger. The color look Faded to me didn't have that pop of color I was expecting. At least it showed up in less than a month and they were really good about the return. I'll still buy from the company.,3
610668,"I love this skirt. Very feminine. However, it's sheer even with the lining, so I've had to
wear a slip under it. I'm 5'3"" and I would have liked it to be an inch and a half longer. Other than that,
it fits me well, and I've gotten lots of compliments on it.",4
207297,I just received my heart stockings and I am happy with them . Yea they do run a little small on me even though I am 5'5 110 lbs. but it's not really a big deal . The hearts are cute and altogether it's a really good deal .! :),5
341426,"I was very impressed when I took these leggings out of the package.  I ordered 3  and  they looked durable and very nice, but two of them had a different tag name that starts with (L) and the third one had a tag with the name Sofra..  Sofra leggings was the only one  that did not rip off, the other two with the (L) tag name both ripped off while I was trying them on.",1
540895,"It looked better on the computer, but in person, the design looked a little cheap and I am curious about how well it will hold up when cleaned. I still really like the shirt, got compliments, and plan to order again in a different color. The purple is spot on, nice quality, and fits very well since I compensated for the difference between US and Asian sizes. Thanks!",4
496955,"It cost me more to return these awful things than they are worth. You would get what you pay for if they were 30 cents. The design is so beautiful but they show up reeking like a chemical sweat shop, with glue tracks and bubbles in the outer material. These would work for strippers only because they would never be seen in the light. Idk how there are any positive reviews.",1
187254,"shirt is OK but it will shrink a bit. I'm between XL and 2X. first time I washed it it shrunk about ""almost"" a half size. I'd recommend if you are a full 2X then order the 3X and wash it in warm to make it go down that half size. Then you'll have your 2X with a little extra room rather than the other way around.",4
220975,As I rounded the corner of 50 years my vision started to wane and it was always tough locating readers glasses. But ThinOptics changed things for me and now I have glasses tucked into my IPhone case - meaning I know exactly where I can find them! They are simple and work very well. Outstanding!!!,5
55702,"its' really a very nice and very well made jacket
and everyone warned me that it runs big so i got the small
but i had no idea that the arms were so big as well - the just puff out too much
the rest of it fit ok
still a great jacket so leaving a decent rating",4
879078,"Love this dress, just make sure you size appropriately!  I am usually between a small and a medium (5'4"" 130lb, weight is in my hips) and I purchased a large, which fits perfectly.  I get a lot of compliments on the print as well.  The fabric is medium thickness, not see-through, and feels really comfortable.  Great dress for the price!",5
325300,When I first opened the package the pants smelled horrible- unable to bear it I threw them in washer- hung them on door to dry overnight. I just put them on and the fit was tight! But tight in all the right places I really like them! Kinda sexy I got XXL I'm usually a size 16/18 becyi have a large butt and thick thighs. I just ordered a second pair.,5
217045,"Amazon Primer here.  I needed a nice big sun hat as I am a bit of a ginger, and this is a good one.  The inside of the brim is lined with fabric, so it does a great job of keeping the sun off.  The drawstring is a nice addition to make sure it doesn't blow off on a windy day, or to just hang it on your back when you don't want it on your head.  :)",4
257392,"I excepted this to be an actual swim suit. The material was not swimsuit material at all, it was very see through. The top was a long cloth that you need to basically figure out how to put it on.. The colors do not even match the ones on the picture. The green is like a dark ugly poop green. I was very disappointed in this purchase! I returned it the next day.",1
873684,This is way way bigger than expected. Just bought 2 big face Oulm watches. This is definitely  too big for my taste. The watch looks exactly like the picture and the delivery was fast. One less star due to its size. You must have a really big forearms for this watch to look good on you.,4
312514,"Super cute shoe however runs wide and big, I'm a size 10 however this size 10 is too big. I went to a sporting goods store and tried the same shoe on  turns out with this particular shoe I'm a 9.5, so order half the size u normally are.",3
706719,The dress came a week after valentines day and it was beautiful the only thing that became annoying to me was the fact that it was itchy to my skin after a night out for dinner i must say its a dress to wear for the moment but not an all nighter type of dress to wear for the simple fact of it being itchy and irritating to my skin it is also short i got it in a small but it was nice to take pictures in and ive got good compliments from others on how it looked.,3
670304,"These earrings are pretty, but they are so thin...not much more substantial than foil.  Even the wires are smaller than usual.  I couldn't even get a safety back to stay on to secure the earrings to my ear.  One of the earrings fell off on my first wear.  I am sad about this because they are pretty.",2
438336,"Generally, i like this product. it feels like a leather in hand. it is soft and light and i can fit most of my cards. but the product i received has some damage on the sides which i showed in the photos. so i am a little bit disappointed about that. but generally i recommend it.",4
14707,Got them quickly with Prime and have been using them for about a week now.  Fit perfectly replacing the pad in my New Balance sneakers.  The old one were falling apart and would give me blisters if used running or hiking.  These insoles were comfortable immediately and I am glad to have them giving new life to my shoes.  I will add/subtract my rating after I see how they work for a few months.  Reviews have been good so I hope they hold up.,4
462987,"I am really going to do more to avoid these clothing items sourced with Asian sizes.  They are poorly made, and don't translate to a Western body frame, since I am no longer 115#.  The neck opening is not evenly cut (the right side is wider than the left); even when buttoned the chest sags forward and the arm holes are too tight.  Going to good will in the next trip; not worth trying to wear again.",2
789354,"This is a nice Tank. It flows away from the body. Long enough to cover your bum. The material is cool.
I got a lot of  good comments on this top . The high cut on the top of the shoulders is flattering for most women.
The color was true. I ordered black and after one washing it is still the same black. To me the way an article of clothing looks after it is washed
is what has me loving it!!  There are so many wonderful colors available I'm going to pick up a couple more!",5

For reference, I'm 54 ~ 145# ~ 34B bust 28 waist 34 and ordered this in black / medium. I normally wear a size 8 in bottoms or a M in tops.
I would appreciate a ""yes"" click below if you found my review helpful :)",2
92732,"The pj's are really cute but the quality isn't great... the seams on the pants are not straight at all. The seam that should run across the center of the babies bottom is too far to one side, making the pants looked croocked (?). I'm alittle dissapointed but because they came just in time for christmas eve (which is our tradition to open a gift of pj's) I kept them.",3
526233,"The robe was very long and fitted too large.  However, that was not the real issue.  The quality was dreadful, it almost looked as though it was a used garment, pilled and in some areas the material was almost bare.  I had bought this item as a present for my Mother-in-law, it arrived wrapped in plastic so I did not investigate it too closely.  I was horribly embarrassed when I realized the quality was so poor.  DO NOT ORDER THIS ITEM.",1
568797,"I ordered an XL (extra large) what I got was a 2XL even though the tag says 1X.

S M L XL 2X etc. are the standard uniform size code for clothing.... 1X is a 2XL NOT an XL, I did try on one of the tank tops to see and it was clearly a size too big.  With the cheap cost of these it is NOT worth sending back.

Will never order form this company again.",1
234376,"The sizing on this is completely off! I read in previous reviews that this ran small, so I ordered a Large size. I'm 5'9""/125lbs and normally wear a Small. The Large on this fit me just right around my chest (very snug actually), but it was way too wide starting at the waist, making my hips look HUGE.It's also really short, wouldn't even cover my butt.
Too bad - I was looking forward to wearing this for a holiday party, but I'll be returning it instead.",2
127888,"The fact that these were lined was nice, making them much warmer than normal leggings. However, because of the lining, they don't come close to stretching like normal leggings. They were extremely short when on, making it necessary to wear leg warmers to cover up the rest of my legs.",2
235602,Good quality.  Had to trim the flat piece that inserts into wallet so that it would fit but easily done.  Individual pockets on each side of each flap so credit cards do not have to touch each other.  It had too many individual holders so I just cut off the ones I didn't need.,4
453347,"Wow, don't sweat while wearing this shirt.  I've had this shirt for a bit over a month now, and only worn in a few times -- after the first time I really sweated in it, the dark grey started getting a sort of orange colored hue to it in the armpits and on the chest, and no amount of washing would actually remove it.  Super lame.",1
316484,"I really like this slip/dress extender!  The quality is EXCELLENT - super soft and the lace is gorgeous and not too delicate. I did, however, order a size up due to others' reviews of it running small and am glad I did. I am normally a medium but ordered a large.",5
95789,"I bought these a half size down because of what everyone else said about them. The right one fit perfectly but the left was very difficult to slip on. After stretching it out in the freezer, now, they both fit perfectly. I'm so happy I went a half size down, because leather will stretch.  I think if I had gotten my correct size they would have been just a little big and my foot would have been sliding around when I walk everywhere.  I want to wear them every day, they are so comfortable!!!",4
141569,"This bag is beautiful and seems to be very well made.  It has room for all of my things; not only is it work appropriate, it is a great bag to carry on the weekends as well.  I am thinking of buying another one as a present for a friend because I like this one so well!",5
116542,I took into consideration that the model was Asian so I ordered a size up so this would be baggy on me. What arrived was so big I could probably use it as a blanket. There was also a red string that kind of sewed the ends together in the front. I could cut it and pull it out pretty easily but it is still big.,3
783373,"These earring are AMAZING!!! Lately I got interested in pearls and was looking for earrings. When I finally found these I was amazed at the way they are made, very delicate, nice look, little bit shiny (exactly what you'd want), they look like golden earrings with real pearls with small accent of diamonds. Not cheap look at all. LOVE THEM, LOVE THEM, LOVE THEM. And I am buying them for my friend, can't stand to enjoy them by myself. :-)",5

You can't go wrong with this one.",5

They are a great size and very light weight. Very elegant and pretty. They are a bit tricky to put on at first. The pegs that go through the earring and your ear are very fragile. I would suggest to not be rough housing around wearing these earrings. I feel that they could break easily, by doing so. The pegs might be too large for smaller piercing holes. Other than that, they came as expected and I adore them !! Worth every penny.",5
249638,I returned the Paris taxi wallet. The quality was not equal to the price in my opinion. The stitching inside obscured part of the Paris quote which I might have ignored at a bargain price such as half the price I paid or less.

818906,"Great ring! The ring is darker than in the photo so be aware of that. On the 3mm, size 7 ring the engraving was so small you can barely read it but it is there. I also have the same ring in 6mm, size 9.5 and that is a bit easier to read the engraving because of the larger ring size. Also be aware that this ring has nickel in it in case you are allergic.",5

The old one is still functional, just the plastic is cracking.  I really like how thin it is and how long it lasts.  I literally wear them out.",5
421822,"Very Nice, However; the pattern is a bit more brown and doesn't resemble the crystal clear black & brown details as in the ad photo. The fit is a tad loose (i am full faced/wide). Beautiful case & presentation! You could use the case for other purposes than eyewear storage. Very nice vendor; they enclosed their business card & 15% off toward next purchase w/nice thankyou! Final note; decent sunglasses for the money spent, especially for the fact if you lost them & wouldn't be hurt if they were high end designer prices.",4
13439,"For my plantar fasciitis these are the best.  And the least expensive!  I purchased these for about $23 and just noticed as I'm trying to order more the price has increased. Of course!  I've tried super feet green and orthaheel relief full size, both pricey.  These feel like I have a bit more arch support from front to back.  And the heel is a bit more cushiony.  I compared them while wearing one of each.",5

74531,"I'm 6'3, 170lbs and the Length of the 3x/4x  worked for me, of course the waist had to be folded a bunch and slips down a bit. But they came messed up! Looks like a strand was pulled or something. Very disappointed with that. Don't have time to send back.",2
830835,"The fabric quality was nice-ish, but the fit itself was very off. I normally wear an XL, but ordered a 3XL according to the size chart the seller provided. However, the dress was very long on me (which I understand may be due to being a mere 5'2""), but this was excessive. Also, the bust area was very awkward. I have big-ish breasts, but even they could not fill the cups in the dress. That made it look ridiculous on me. I returned the dress for a full refund.",1
96641,"Arrived on time. I probably should have gone with a 7.5 instead of an 8 because they do seem a little big, but if I wear thick socks they are fine. Also, they can sometimes make a very annoying squeaky noise when I run on certain surfaces so I'm trying to get them worn in. Over-all, I am satisfied with my purchase!",4
788296,"This was crazy. The bottoms fit GREAT. The top however was total unexplainable. It was huge, and was not like the picture at all. The tie's were super long and even after looking at the picture I couldn't figure it out. It's like I had extra pieces?

 I gave it to the Goodwill.",1
353569,"After reading the reviews I took my chances and ordered it.
Normally, I wear a small so I ordered a large (as suggested). If you are a size zero with B cups and a short torso this would fit perfect! I however and not a size zero. I looked like a stuffed sausage! My husband had a good chuckle before I packaged it back up and printed a rerun label.
Overall, I will give it 2 stars for the laughs and because I still think it's a cute suit. If they got the sizing corrected I would attempt to purchase it again.",2
420877,"I really like these sneaks. They are cute and easy to put on and off.  They are a tad stiff tho, but I'm hoping they will losen up and be a little more comfy. And the 8.5 size is a little big. That's normally what I wear these days. But because they are stiff, I think the 8s would have been much tighter.",3

I'm going to get the arm holes tapered just a tad to make it look perfect. Also, you're going to need a slip... for sure. This is terribly see-through. Other than that, it is really nice.
I'm a B/C cup, size 18, and this dress fits really well.",5

She has to roll the waist band up about six times because they are so long. Additionally, they don't fit quite snug, not the way leggings should anyway. So, if you're think and relatively short, then these might be too big for you.",3
61256,"I have received and used prayer blankets, but never a prayer shawl. I wanted to understand the meaning and uses so purchased this and a book here on Amazon.com - ""Secrets Of The Prayer Shawl Paperback  July 17, 2008""
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1438253346/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_4, by Prof M.M.Ninan.
So glad I did.
This shawl is beautiful and when folded goes perfectly into its cloth zippered bag next to my bed. Thank you!",5
507135,"I just set this watch up. Just looked it up on how to. Press once then wait 2 seconds press and hold then it blinks change the hour then right after press right away then hold again, change minutes then hold again it switches to mouth, change it, hold again change day. Your done. Great watch. Kid loves it. Need help email me",5
642789,"Great sandals.  I was worried I might need a wide fitting but with the adjustable straps these are just perfect.  Doctor ordered to correct a problem with my foot and I can feel a difference after just a few weeks.  They look good, feel good and it seems they're doing me good too - what more can I ask for?",5
416156,"I think this is the best gift for anyone who is part of the Wanted Fanmily. The only thing I would want to change is the length of the necklace which is not adjustable. Besides that I love the jewels on both sides. The size of the heart was pretty big, but I like it, and the weight of the metal is perfect because it doesn't feel like a toy.",5
19431,Nice wide brim to keep the sun off my little mans head. He is 18months but has a rather large noggin so I got the 2-4 year size. It's got this zip tie like string around the base of the part that goes over his head that tightens up so it fits him perfect and can be adjusted as needed. The tie for underneath his chin is nice and long so I can make sure I tie a good knot so it will stay on his head. Would buy again and reccomend it to others.,5
109644,This was very good choice am really happy with it it fit perfect  as the way I want it I defiantly recommend it .. Very beautiful color too but it long you need to where heel so will look much batter I could not be casual dress it fancy dress f,5
439354,"This is a cute hat but I had to return it because the glue holding the rope part wasn't doing a good job! Upon opening package the rope was already half off! Also I like a 3"" brim hat. This was a 4"" inch very floppy straw brim. Someone with a bigger face might really like it.",3
732597,"fabric is much mire sheer than it looks in the photo, I ordered and XL because I am usually a U.S. medium but the buttons still pulled on my bust, which is my usual issue with button-up shirts, the sleeves were too short, and the rest was too bi-g especially in the shoulders, I am 5ft7 and I think this would only work for a more petite and less busty gal",1
857424,"I bought this because I wanted aa ID holder that could also hold some cash & change for the pop machine at work. Fits my work ID card (which still scans through the plastic sleeve), along with a few dollars and my card for the pop machine. I like the key ring attachment because I can clip my important room keys on there. I haven't decided if I should buy the matching strap, though, as I don't have a huge need for it. Fits in my jean pocket just fine.",5
568691,"I will give this 4 stars with a warning: 2 out of 4 leggings were damaged. One black legging had an eraser sized hole on the upper thigh, and the charcoal had a hole in the crotch, at least that one is fixable. The seam opened, so a quick stitch and its good as new.

But the fit is great! Im 6ft tall and they're nice and long! Super comfortable.",4
110174,"Bought these leggings due to the fact that they were a little longer. They fit just perfect and are long enough to reach the ankle, which I love, (don't like waiting for high tide) being tall makes it hard to find length in leggings. Great buy and will purchase in different colors for sure.",5
143543,"looks cheap as expected. Not as long as pictured and the sleeves were kind of short on me and I am 504... was kind of surprised. Will not really recommend this product. It is really nice on the picture, but I was so disappointed at the actual product. I believe we should expect that for the price :-(",2
421068,"I purchased these glasses and after a couple months they developed a small crack on the frame. I bought a second pair of dot-dash glasses (Convex) thinking it was just this style. Those too developed a small crack on the frame. Neither pairs have any scratches or damage other than the crack. I emailed dot-dash several times to cs, sales, and marketing when my first pair cracked. I didn't hear from anyone. I emailed again when my second pair started cracking. I have emailed them 7 times and never received anything back from them.",1
740223,"I should have listened to the negative reviews when I bought this, but I thought, Hey, it's only five dollars... it was a waste of money, and immediately went into the trash. The fit is just awful, and I bought it baggy on purpose and it just made me look like a joke of a whale. I wear baggy sweaters all winter without this problem. It does not fit like the picture, unless maybe you are stick thin with no curves whatsoever.",1
277534,"It's the worst piece of junk I've ever bought.  Before I even tried it on for the first time, the rods inside the corset popped out of the frame, causing it to pinch the skin.  I can't believe this is so poorly constructed. Will definitely never buy from this seller again.",1
105822,"This is a very delicate looking and feeling piece, so I do try to be gentle with it. I get at least one compliment almost every time I wear it. Giving it 4 stars because I like my necklaces to hang lower and the 16 inch chain it comes on is just too short for my preferences. I put it on a 20 inch chain and it's perfect.",4
100912,"I've ordered these briefs before and enjoyed them. But I bought these in May and these recent ones are smaller, and the fly is so small I can barely get three fingers into them in order use the fly. The fly hole is too small on both ends, so after navigating this narrow fabric, there's no room to find my stuff in there. I resorted to pulling these briefs up from one of the legs so I could accomplish my goal.",1
767433,This top is really comfy yet long enough to wear with leggings.  The material is almost sweatshirt like which I wasn't expecting but happy with.  I was worried that it would pill and get nasty as I washed - however I have washed and dried many times and still holding up great.,5
406195,"My 3 year old loves his TMNT hat. I personally think the paint makes the hat a little stiff. I thought the different colors (like purple, white, black) were yarn, when really it's paint on top of yarn. I did machine wash the hat and air dry.  It washed well and was a little softer afterward. As long as my son is happy with it, I am too.",4
816888,I got a different buckle but it's still nice. West Leathers Belt are really nice and no holes makes these belts a winner.  Very easy to use and easy to adjust. I have encluded a picture of the belt I ordered. Very comfortable and quality leather.  I recieved this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. My review is my own personal opinion and reflects my experience with the product. I have not been encouraged by any manufacture or any third-party to give a positive or false review.,5
74329,"I managed to get them on well enough for my costume, but thankfully Im wearing them with a long skirt. They are kinda sagging in the crotch because they are a little short in the legs and I am by no means a tall girl. They are also fairly tight with on me. They fit fine for my costume, but Im 54 155 usually a size 10 and these are pretty tight on me.",3
541894,"The color of this dress is gorgeous, however, it is definitely short! I usually wear a medium, but I purchased the large in hopes that it would be a little longer. I am 5'5 and it hit me right below the butt. I plan on sewing a piece of fabric to the bottom to make it wearable.",3
78958,I bought this one because of the heart and the bling bling.  I went to a kids birthday my 8 year old niece admired it so much that I gave it to her.  She was showing it to everyone...she loved it.  Another item that I will have to buy after the holidays if they are still available.,5
609285,"I love wearing the Ring on my hand, then the delicate silver chain looks so lovely on my neck.  The item arrived quickly and exactly as described.  I'd had a previous one,  but sadly lost it.  It's a constant reminder to turn to God for all matters in my life.",5
822265,"This is a beautiful dress. Coming up on my wedding day and I just tried it on. It is a perfect fit. Nicely snug with plenty of movement. Love the lace. It's nice to know that I'll be able to use it for other occasions, after it's primary use. I can't wait.",5
617749,Material seems cheaper than how it looks in the picture and it's thinner than I expected. I normally buy a medium in Asian size and it fits perfectly. I ordered the light gray one; it's a much lighter shade than it looks in the picture. The cloth is a little rough on the skin. I love the style though.,4
92604,"Really Amazon? You thought it was a good idea to sell a product called, ""Dead Dog Prop""? Just last week the city of Detroit found a dog that had been partially skinned and left for dead on someone's porch. That dog, like so many that suffer at the hands of psychopaths, has been through suffering that no human could even comprehend! It is not only in poorest of taste that you sell this product, but you also ignore all those that have suffered. You and the seller should be ashamed.",1
516166,"I tried the Amazon Prime FREE Same-Day shipping and let me just say I'm super satisfied that it arrived on-time, a few hours earlier than the estimate even!

When I opened the box it came with two little rings and a chain so everything is good. I checked each pendant and all of them are very detailed -- definitely worth what I paid for!",5
355707,"Travel reading glasses are always a compromise between lens size and case size.  These work well for me because the lens size is a bit larger than many but the case is smaller because it is metal (so has thin walls) and rectangular (so not this big round tube where the glasses are in the middle and air all around).  So no wasted space, fits in my pocket well.",5
241351,"WE LOVE THIS RING! My husband's trade (custom granite & tile) necessitates a durable ring! This is definitely it! He loves how comfortable it is and it looks absolutely gorgeous! Beautiful design, work,.and metal. NOTE: he normally wears a size 14, but the 12.5 fits perfectly, having just enough for him to get over his knuckle.",5
33105,"this jacket is not leather! though marked as leather on a tag, it is a poly material that smells like leather, for a day
then when that smell goes away you know it is pleather.... it has already ripped in two places, loose and cheap thread
not worth the money, do not buy this product, such a waste of money, fraudulently represented by nice pics",1
472995,"The brown leather matched several of my belts. I also wanted a pair of brown shoes that looked sharp with my blue and gray suits. I wanted something that was not flashy. So, I bought them. They coordinated with my suits and belt. I am an 8.5 D. They fit like should. Overall, it met all of my requirements. That got it to three. The fact I that I wear them occasionally with jeans in casual situations bumped it to four.",4
174667,Im 5'5 and 127lbs and I purchased a small. The fit was perfect! I gave this outfit 5 stars because I loved it for my skeleton costume but I do have one complaint. The design is as shown in the picture but the leg bones stop at the knee. Not that big of a deal but I don't like it when I purchase something based on a photo and what I receive is not exactly what is in the photo advertised. Other than that I loved this cat suit and will wear it again in the future.,5
771318,It's good quality material BUT! The elastic band on the pants is really thick and stiff and i feel like it would be too tight around a baby's tummy. I sew so I plan to replace the elastic for sure. Not comfortable for a baby a baby at all. And this is a 6 month + size for sure. I wouldn't be shocked if it fit more of a 12 month old.,2
764750,"Only complaint is that right at first the cards are a bit hard to slide in and out due to how to tight the flaps of the wallet come, but I am sure this will stretch out and be easier soon enough. But other than that, it is a great wallet!",4
112588,"The skirt was really cute and the picture shown is accurate and just as pretty.
It arrived in a plastic bag and it smelt heavily of plastic. After letting it air out, it smells fine.
I'm 5' 3"" and the skirt doesn't hit the floor without heels (I wear it a little high).
One thing you can't tell from the pictures is the detail in the black waistband -instead of a plain black band, there is a square pattern that is really nice.",4
410100,"I received a lot of compliments on this bracelet on New Year's. I'm only taking away one star because the clasp is a little iffy, but any bracelet of this bulk would be difficult to close/open--you need a helper (I have a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bracelet-Buddy/dp/B0006Z3HMW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bracelet Buddy</a>). It wasn't heavy or intrusive, felt comfortable to wear, but I wasn't doing a lot where my wrist was resting on a surface (where it might have felt a little bulky).",4
689132,"These are almost my go to pair for every day wear!  I love the earthy tones.  The length is great, too. Silver Forest earrings are perfect for people with sensitive ears.  I had not worn earrings for YEARS because of that.  Now I found these and am in heaven!",5
665082,"The quality of this item seemed ok, about appropriate for a beach town or by the pool, which is what I wanted. The top has bra cups which is nice. There were many lose threads on the bottom but nothing you couldn't take care of. It was, however very very LARGE. I am 110 lbs and 5'3"", typically an extra small. I bought a small and it was enormous. Literally so big there would have been no way for me to wear it.",3
337325,"After much much much research, I went and bought this verses some others I was checking out. Great smoothness over-all, light weight, and breathable yes. Downfall, does NOT help lift my butt at all!! And I've got a booty and this did nothing. After two kids tho, my butt has begun to sag alittle and I had high hopes this would've helped give it that ""lift"", and sadly it does not.",3
230517,"So love this bathing suit. very flattering for me being a plus size women. I feel very comfortable, the only thing is I still wear a bra because I feel I need a lil more support in the chest area which can just be me. either way love it and will probably be ordering another one different pattern do a lot of swimming. Thank you!",5
347377,The dress is gorgeous!!! Absolutely stunning and just as I expected. I ordered an XL because I have a big ass and big boobs as well. The XL fit perfectly and was true to size. I'm a size 12 in dresses so I hope that helps in determining what size to order. All in all this a a great purchase because this dress worked wonders at my birthday party.,5
588961,"I somehow lost the case that came with my Ray Bans, so I bought this one as a replacement. I was happy at first, until this morning when I tried to open the case and found that the tab had started pulling away from the snap closure (see photo). I bought the case at the end of April, I would have expected this to last at least a year, if not longer.",1
586026,Completely disappointed. The wording is nothing more than a paper sticker. It was wrinkled and partial off when we open the package. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT! Very disappointed. Calling Amazon to complain and get a refund. Putting out such an inferior product honoring veterans is shameful.,1
52089,"We love these sun hats! I used them for my first two kids, and ordered a new one for my third baby. The adjustable head size means that I can use it from newborn until probably around 1 year old, which is perfect! We live in Florida and I put this hat on my almost bald baby most days - in her Ergo carrier, in her stroller, at the beach/pool - it washes up nicely and provides great protection.",5
800499,"They are beautiful bows, the only down side is that you cannot out them through a collar the hole is too small. They do come with an elastic black band but it was too big for my dog. Wished you could slide them into a collar. I have ones that do so these were a little disappointing.",2
520786,"The blouse is very pretty. It's lightweight, the colors are vibrant and the embroidery is good. I would hand wash it though because machine washing with other items, even on a delicate cycle, might cause damage to the blanket stitching around the neck and sleeves. Overall it's a nice blouse, except the 3X is way too big for me. It's more like a 26/28 than a 22/24. I'm returning it for a smaller size.",5
112594,"the waste band is a bit thicker than expected and it's slightly snug for a medium if you wear it on your hips, but if you wear it as a high waist skirt then it's perfect. it's definitely worth the money in my opinion, the fabric is very flowy and pretty.",4
408785,"Maggie's used to make honest, organic cotton socks, but they now are adding things like 20% Coolmax -- anything but ""organic"". It is so sad the state of things -- when even the most pure products sell out. What we would pay for a pure, organic or natural cotton -- high quality, high three count -- sock!! Please get it together Maggie's!",2
283033,"This will  have to be my all time favorite swim suit! the material is nice and thick. If you have larger breasts i would recommend a size up because if that, but i didn't and it was a bit snug there but other than that i would highly suggest getting this for a fun and cute little suit",5
768433,"I would give less than 1 star if possible. Gave it as a gift, then they wouldn't let us return it. We ordered a 2XL, and got what said it was a 2XL, but it was actually more like a medium. It wasn't even close to fitting. Don't waste your money.",1
16072,"This is my very first prayer Tallis Prayer Shawl, so I don't have anything to compare it to.  I think it is beautiful and a good quality product.  When I put it over my head to pray I felt as though it served its Holy purpose to close me off from the world and strengthen my communion with G-d.  Very nice.",5
812077,"I ordered a size 8, and the size that arrived was about a six.  The color of the inner stone was greatly distorted from the picture, turning out to be a light and tacky peach.  The ring was gaudy and cheap.  I would never buy from this seller again.",1
15337,"I frequently purchase these inserts for myself and for my husband, who has had several foot surgeries.  I like that it provides excellent support, but is not rigid.  This is about the 6th pair of these I have purchased over the past 5 years.  These are ideal for people who need support for the foot and arch they have.  The plastic supports force the foot into a shape that may not be ideal, making this one a great overall support for anyone.",5
410713,"I buy a fair amount of jewelry from Amazon, but this is the first time I have been moved to write a review. These are gorgeous! All the stones are nicely colored, and the interplay of turquoise and peridot is really striking.

I also appreciated the product inserts that told me more about the designer and how she feels about her work -- very nice personal touch! Thank you.",5
327522,"It's a soft, comfortable, balaclava that keeps my hood in place, and my head, face, ears, and neck, toasty warm in brutal New England winters. I have a Columbia Mighty Lite Hooded Coat that I really like with one exception. The hood doesn't have a drawstring and it will blow back in windy weather. Hats were too bulky and moved around under it, blinding me. I'm so glad I found this one. I've worn it through two winters and washed it many times and it's still in great shape. I'm ordering a few more in different colors.",5
776914,I love this wristlet...I gave it only 4 stars because of the size. It is called a purse but in no way could it be my purse...I am actually making mine my wallet. That way it is serving a purpose while in my everyday purse. It charges my android phone super fast! So overall I do love it and would buy another one.,4
347364,"This dress was absolutely stunning! It was perfect for my 30th Birthday Mardi Gras Celebration. Definitely a head turner and had me feeling like a queen all night long. It was not as gold as i thought it would be, more so a rose gold but turned out perfect for my special night. I also had the sleeves slightly adjusted to resemble a cap sleeve (personal preference).",4
201148,"I ordered a large and it seems like they've sent a small or a medium. This costume is cheaply made. The top is a little see through but it's fixed with a nude or white bra (or tank top.) Overall, I would not recommend this product to anyone unless you're small & you're going to wear it for one time.",1
115621,it was ok I liked that it had allota tulle but in the back where the butt is it looked way to flat like there needed to be extra tulle or something and if you don't have some full skirt underneath you won't get that flare it will just sit on you lol,2
711751,"Stay true to your normal size pj's. These are roomy without being too big. I like mine larger but found the large (one size up for me) to be too big. Medium is perfect. As far as length, I'm only 4'11... Not a good person for you to judge the length.",5
407762,"I was super excited to see a long wallet like this that could hold cash, but over time, the straps on my red one wore looser. My money started falling out not 2 months after use. I recommend going with a different solution... something with a zipper that can hold some cash. I wish I'd not wasted my time or money on this.",1
673399,"Was very disappointed, the size was handwritten so not sure how accrue the size was and it did not fit me. Also the bead work on the top half of the dress was very pretty however you are going to have some raw arm. So I returned the dress back.",2
106570,"This item looks as expected, other than the fact that it is Ivory colored instead of White, but I was not upset about that. I guess the photo could be accurate, if you aren't expecting white white. The fabric was also very nice. It's not silk, but it's soft and billowy, and it feels great to wear. I got all kinds of compliments.
The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is because I received the item (light colored) with a stain on the front. It was very noticeable, but not enough to ruin it.",4
806802,"Love this shirt!  The fit is as expected.  The quality of the shirt is very high, in fact much higher than the pictures portray online.  The thickness is just right for a T-Shirt and it just feels ""good.""  Highly recommend to anyone looking for a cute shirt for their toddler.

This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.",5
370207,Lovs this lanyard and I'd. My biggest concern was if I could scan through it...and I can! Well made and sturdy. The clip is easy to add other items on as it opens up ( not a hassle like putting keys on a keychain) LOVE the subtle  Mickey design as well.,5
218207,Fit is way smaller than the sizing chart. Also didn't know it was a thin sheer fabric. My 12year old daughter barely fits into it even tight on her and its to sheer and sexylooking for a young girl. I really wanted this shirt to wear so im pretty disapointed.,2
436396,"Cute glasses! These are comfortable to wear for long periods of time and look cute. Slightly larger than I was hoping. They do not make anything darker though. So, they are basically fashion shades that don't do any shading. They do the trick for driving around on a sunny day but if you are actually out in the sun they are useless.",3
442146,"Excellent PJs!  Love the Leveret brand---study, adorable, and long-wearing.  The bird pattern of this set is exactly as shown; super cute and cheerful without being nauseatingly sweet with goofy sayings and cartoon characters.  Fit is small, as with all Leveret PJs.  Recommend sizing up 1 or 2 sizes.  My 2 year old is tall and around 30 lbs, and I ordered these in a 4T for a comfortable fit and room to grow.  Great buy, just size up!",5
668851,"This fascinator was cute, but did not provide the sophisticated look I sought. Worse, the headband was extremely uncomfortable and, therefore, unwearable. I will not purchase any more fascinators with headbands, but only those with clips or combs!

Regarding the fit, there is no choice for ""uncomfortable,"" so having to choose one I chose ""Fit as expected."" But it really didn't because it hurt.",2
794106,"I have decided infinity scarves are the way to go for those of us that are useless at trying to tie a regular scarf into those cute neck wraps I see on YouTube.  I just have to hang this and it looks great.  The colors are subtle and neutral enough to go with most any solid color sweater, etc.  And the weight is not too heavy - so it does not feel like it's too much.  The flowers are very cute.",5
809934,These look and sounded like what I was looking for until I put them on my shoes. Followed the directions and started out for my walk. I had not walked 1/2 mile before one came off. Next night I didn't notice that one came off so I backtracked and found it less than 1/4 mile from my house. Packaged these up and sent them back.,2
832889,"Sooo  I used the size chart they offer and found which size I should get, and even ordered one size bigger than that.... I get it and it looked nice so I got excited to try it on..... try it on and it rips. Not happy at all. Couldnt even wear it for what I bought it for.",1
761886,"This vest was very cheaply made. The material is low quality in both look and feel, and wrinkles very easily. In addition, the buttons were barely sewed on. Two buttons came off when the vest arrived and was tried on (and it was too big, so hate to think what might happen is stress had been put on them because of a tight fit). Overall, I wish I had not bothered buying this vest.",2
436173,"Part hat, part headband, i like these headwraps for Winter days in the milder range. Appear to be made well enough. I got 3 or 4 at the same time. i don't like this one as much as I do the solid colors i bought - who knows why?  just personal preference.  there's nothing wrong with it at all.",4
142944,While this is very pretty I did have one issue.  It came in two pieces.  It was a quick fix with some needle nose pliers and connecting the pieces.  I guess since it was so inexpensive I should not complain.  Just a heads up if you order this to not expect quality.,3
449052,"The reason I gave 3 stars my son got this a week after School started and the little front zipper already broke off ,he literally used that zipper for 2 days when he decided to carry this nintendo to school to play on the bus... the bbackyard is cute for him and l but i am not sure it will e engagement last the end of the first quarter of school.",3
93408,"I love how light these earrings are.  Getting them in was not difficult, and once they are in they are very secure.  I am going to purchase extra insert sticks because they are very thin and I will most likely break them.  Beautiful color of wood with great symmetry.  They are the most unique earrings I currently own.",5
436331,"I purchased the Rose Gold color, which is stunning. Even better, I got this on sale! This watch is truly beauteous. It's well-crafted & chic. It comes with an oversize classy box where u can store your watch. I love the large face & it looks very sexy on my wrist. I've received a plethora of compliments. Note: I purchased mine from Nordstrom's.",5
828058,"This hat is so cute and is very well made.  I really like how stretchy it is, enabling it to fit so well.  It stays on my granddaughter's head with ease, and, best of all, she LIKES it!!  Thus, she'll wear it and protect her delicate and beautiful face, head, ears and neck!",5
322413,"It was NOTHING like the picture.  The charm was even on backwards.  The plant material isn't even dandelion seeds. It was some form of shredded plant material...  But not dandelion seeds.  Awful!  I want my money back. If I could leave negative stars,  I would.",1
521130,Terrible quality! The monkey I received looked nothing like the photo! It was going to be a baby shower gift for a friend with a jungle themed nursery but the product looked so bad I could not even give it to my friend. It looked like a scary skull not a monkey. There were no button eyes- it was horrible. I should have know the price was way too good. It was JUNK!,1
422495,I ordered this fory daughter because she loves Bob Marley and she also likes shirts that are cropped a little shorter. She loves it. The quality is good and it fit as expected. It does hang a little looser than most normal tshirt but this is the store of this shirt. So for her it was perfect. One of the other things that she loved was the Jamaican colors on the stitching. This added to the overall presentation. This was shipped super quickly.,5
93699,"This item arrived from overseas.  Can't wear it for a multitude of reasons.  The length is too short; I'm 5'6"" and this item hit me just above the ankles.  Not a good look.  The front in the picture looks like it overlaps a bit, but the item I received doesn't and basically looks like a bathing suit top that reveals a lot of cleavage.  THIS ITEM SMELLED HORRIBLE!!!! I washed it twice already and it still smells faintly of chemical/fish.  Whatever dye they used makes my skin break out.",1
834087,Colors do not match. Hat came as black with a silver logo. The logo is solid silver between the lines and in the middle of the logo. It looks terrible. I would give it 3 stars if they had actually crafted the logo correctly but the colors and logo are all wrong.,1
69064,"The shoes are just ok.  The shoe actually needs a drawstring at the top not only to make the shoe look better but to keep it on the foot.  My son likes to run around in the house with them but the shoes do come off easily so I am skeptical about him wearing them in the water.  If it comes off in the water...whats the point. Plus, more work for me as I'll have to do a search and rescue for a shoe.",3
349273,"It was really pretty. I wore it a few times. The stone just fell out and is gone. I know opals are pretty delicate, so I was very careful with it. I would have thought the settings would have kept it secure, or the stone would have been glued in. I'm pretty disappointed.",2
480926,"My son loves them  he is 9 months and a size 3.5 infant shoe size, he wears them all the time. The ONLY bad thing is that I got the 5 size slipper, it fits him but since he is still little they slip off when he runs around in them. Other then that they fit perfect. he will grow into them.:)",4
127178,My 6 year old son has worn two of these in constant rotation for 2 weeks.  They have yet to break.  They are not made of plastic.  They hold up his pants.  If you have concerns about them breaking.  Feel free to contact me and I will tell you how long they ended up lasting.,4
606077,"I bought it and I got a size extra large and it runs small, it was still too small I wanted to return it but its too much for the shipping, so I had to keep it, and give it as a gift. The quality is not good either.

55299,"This watch is just gorgeous!
There are a number of posts on the internet about ""poor"" customer service at MK stores and that these mall stores will not help resize MK watches purchased outside of their stores. This was NOT my experience. The MK store staff was great; removed my links at no charge and with no fuss at all. I had to remove 5 links because I have a small wrist and wanted the snug fit. The watch looks great on! I looked for 6 months for this white ceramic watch-- should have started my search on Amazon.",5
501423,"Cheaply made!!!!! BEWARE!!!! I wanted herschel but I got fooled thinking it was a herschel backpack. I purchased it around midninght and i must have been tired. You could buy the same item at Chinatown for $10. I paid at least $35 here in Amazon. This is made in China, very cheap materials, fabrics, metal, thread, label, etc. Don't buy it. Go somewhe else, feel it, touch it. Its not the same quality that I was expecting for the amount of hard earned money I paid.",1
334766,"This bracelet is very cute and the color combination is pretty. I like the way it buckles, I've had other similar bracelets that would get tangled (because of the way they buckled) but with this one there is no getting tangled or twisted. I think for the price point the quality could be better, it broke the first time I wore it. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for a fair and honest review.",3
537454,"I ordered a large and it is tiny!  Very form fitting and short sleeves.  Like a child's 10/12.  I wear a size 2 in dresses in the small asian-hole-in-the-wall stores in strip malls and its still fit like an xsmall.  If it wasn't $10 I'd return it.  But I'm just gonna wear it differently.  But the pic here must be on a 10 year little girl. other then that, the maroon is as shown and its cute just not like the pic's fit at all, unless your a child's 10/12",3
803402,The purse looks very nice. Just like how it look displayed on the picture.. The only thing I wasn't so happy with was the fact that it looked used. The tag was ripped off &* it had two scratched on the back of the bag &* a lught scuff on the side of the bag messing up the holigram feature. Like as if it was used before I purchased it. &* I didn't buy it used. It was supposed to be brand new. So disappointed.,2
201378,"The quality is expected for this kind of price. Not the best purchase, but it's kind of my fault for rushing a buy like this. I ordered an X-Large and it barely fit me. Skirt was extremely short (I'm 5'9, so that might contribute) and the fabric was not at all comfortable. I suggest buying this IF you're a size small in US sizing.",1
266154,"4/5
Pros:
 Item arrived as shown
 Top fits perfectly despite bows not sitting directly on the nipple (which I preferred)
 Looks incredibly sexy!

Cons:
 Bottom fit too small (I weigh 95-100lbs & this has little room to stretch & my ""lady lips"" we're quite exposed due to thong only covering pretty much just where pubic hairs grow)",4
87694,"I did not expect this dress to be high quality because of the price. It is thin material, but nothing a slip can;t help with. I thought it looked adorable, especially at the low cost it was. It is pretty short, but wear some spankies or leggings, and that problem is solved.",4
130707,"This is obviously just overwear, so don't buy this for the winter, but it's very stylish and adjustable to your shape. I was afraid it might be a little small, but this fits just as it does in the picture. There are drawstrings in the hood, waist, and bottom of the coat so you may adjust it to your liking. The skull is sewn on completely and hasn't gone off in any washes. My only critique is on the buttons - they stay on, yes, but don't come apart without a little fight.",5
37222,"This hat is great. It is bright and cheerful and does its job shading my little ones' face. I love that the seaming on the brim allows for flipping the brim up or down, depending on how sunny it is outside.  The hat just makes my little one even cuter (is that even possible??? ;)) and does its job protecting from the sun!",5
748840,"The bra is very scandalous & gorgeous, but it seems that the fitting is made for women with smaller, or perkier breasts. I ordered the medium size at first, then exchanged to the large size. It fits okay, but my breasts still feel crammed in. This makes it a little difficult to actually dance around as much as I would like to. Other than that, its a great item!",4
160118,"This is a really cute light weight sweater. Great for fall with a pair of leggings. I love the cut of the top because it's slightly tapered at bottom, so you don't look like you wearing a tent. I only bought one at first because the price was so low I figured it would look cheap, but it doesn't and I'm going to order a few more!",5
107157,"I research everything and buy online. So when I bought my engagement ring fur $12000 I hit a sweet deal on Bluenile. However it came in a cheap blue box. This bad boy is incredible. Solid wood, beautiful. The light makes it amazing. Not too big as other reviewers have said. It's a perfect size in my opinion for proposal and cherish for a
Lifetime!",5
79326,"This romper was perfect for my son's baptism.  We thought the hat looked silly, but the romper was great.  Since it was seersucker, he wore a white onesie underneath for warmth.  I paired this romper with white socks and satin shoes with crosses on them.  We received many compliments on how cute he looked.",5
408417,My girlfriend loves trees so when I saw this I knew it was perfect. When I received it I was happy with the quality. She has had the necklace for close to 2 year with no complaints. It is also nice because it is fairly neutral so she can wear it with many outfits. Im happy because the quality has stood up.,5
87799,"These were a great value.  I have sunglasses and reader all over the place.  I now have them all nicely protected in these covers.  They are great in that they can be used to clean the glasses as well.  I got so many, that  I could gift some to friends and family.",4
119314,"Despite some of the comments saying that they were broken when they arrived, mine arrived in great quality! THe metal these are made of held the ears in place and they don't even hurt after wearing them for a while like a normal headband would! The rhinestones were all in place when they arrived and I'm very happy with this purchase. Arrived sooner than expected and overall 5 out of 5 stars! I would recommend this",5
357805,"I love this dress, it fits beautifully. The only drawback is I was born with wandering ladies so they pull the dress to the side. This means the padding does nothing and I still have to wear a strapless bra to get the rounded ""together"" look I want and it means a bit of the bra shows in the middle but everyone thinks its just a peek-a-boo triangle cover up panel. Beautiful dress.",5
800137,Would have given the item a five star except I ordered a size bigger than usual because I'm larger up top (40DD) and the xxl top of this suit is is still to small :(  I'm a 14 on the bottom on a good day and 16 on a bad day and the xxl bottoms fit great,4
287319,"UPDATE;  OK  I received my watch back from Citizen and they found nothing wrong with it except it was not charged.  They charged it and it now functions fine.  So, for my purposes this product did not work.

Simply put, the jury is still out on this product.  I'm not convinced my watch's power cell is working as purchased either.  To date though, this LED charger has not added charge to my watch even after 72 plus hours of constant exposure to its lighting setup.  More when I know it.",2

416362,"This is a great strap for its price, and totally worth it. Having a yoga class in the middle of my daily schedule means that I have to carry my mat around for a while, and this strap has saved me. After a while, the strap does slide around a bit, but it is completly manageable and understandable. Great product!",5
413777,"Have been so excited to get this.  I got an XL which is what I always wear.  Tshirts shrink.  This is so small I can barely get it on.  Checked the tag, XL.  Waited 3 weeks to get from china.  Don't buy this garbage if they can't get the size right.",1
369267,"First time purchasing a waist trainer and I absolutely love it! The first time trying to put it on was probably a funny site to see, but once on it is amazing. The straps the first 2 times wearing it did hurt my armpits, but now it's fine. I wear it all day everyday. I love the way it holds everything in and the way I look in clothes. I will definitely be purchasing another one :)",5
124731,"Instead of stars in my eyes, I have HEARTS!  Love these sunglasses.  They were just a fun pair of glasses to take with me on vacations so that if I lost them it was no big deal.  Well, I love them, so I wear them at home too.  Sturdy.  Not too big.  The fade of the tinting looks nice too.  Gold tone rims.  Comfortable on the nose and ears.  Great price for fun sunglasses!",5
554207,"I love my Sequined dress with big sleeves. But unfortunately it only fits like a top for a woman of my size, even though I purchased a XL. I'm a full figured woman at 5'0 tall and 180 lbs. It fits like a dress on a more smaller and taller woman. But I'm satisfied because I could wear leggings with it and still be sophisticated and classy. Thank you for the email, it shows great concern. Not everyone is concern about how the customer is satisfied with their product and or merchandise.",5
180256,"I was kind of worried this would be a cheap looking bag, but it's actually VERY nice, and it is seriously simple and good for an everyday look. The material on the inside is a little cheap, think.. 100 thread count sheet material thats a little stiff. But who cares? It's a great bag. I'm probably going to be ordering the nude colored bag next.",5
84974,Love the zipper neckline and dolman sleeves. T he banded bottom part is a bit unforgiving if your bottom is a bit larger than your top. I bought a Large (I am a size 8-10) and it looks like the picture except when I turn around. My butt kind of sticks out but with tights and chunky boots--not a bad look.,4
630328,Absolutely adorable. My husband loves this wallet. I doubt the durability of this wallet as it is a little flimsy and soft. My husband is kinda rough and tumble and has a very physically demanding job... We will see if this wallet lasts... But again... HE LOVES THIS WALLET!!!! It looks great!,4
275550,"I spent 20 years in the military, so I was used to wearing a belt with no holes.  I often wondered why this didn't catch on 30 years ago.  This belt works just like my old army belt only it is leather.  Works like a charm and I can control exactly how tight or loose I want the belt to be.",5
801424,"This is a nice basic cargo capri. While the legs fit me as expected, the belly panel is slightly too big (I wear a Small in all other maternity brands - Target, Old Navy, Gap, etc., but this Small from Motherhood was noticeably bigger). It's also SUPER stretchy, which makes it prone to sagging throughout the course of a day.",4
440020,"I wanted a two-piece tankini to wear around the pool, and this one fit the bill perfectly.  It looks great on, and I don't have a problem with it moving up, showing my belly.  I did match the top with another black swimsuit bottom that I already owned as I'm not a fan of the style of bottoms that come with this one.",5
511247,"Bought this shirt for my husband as a cute day after wedding tee. He is 6'2"" and normally wears somewhere between a large and an extra-large. I ordered the XL to be safe, but could have ordered the L. The shirt was good quality and held up in the wash.",5
68872,"I really like and they seem rue to size (if anything possibly on the small size, but not by much). Well constructed and durable.  The only issue is that they are hard to get on.  But once they are on they stay on (which cannot be said of my kid's other shoes with velcro straps).",4
406580,"I really like this watch.  I would have given it 5 stars, but the bezel is fixed and the description said unidirectional and that was was one of the deciding factors in my picking this watch.  I replaced the push-button band with an old Seiko band with a safety deployment because it opens up wider to allow my hand to escape.  This is my first automatic and after 10 days it's averaging 7 seconds fast per day.  Small trade-off for not having to buy batteries again.",4
254434,"These boots are, in my opinion, pretty close to perfect. They are beautiful, versatile, and very comfortable. I haven't had the slipping heel problem that some other reviewers mentioned; I'm guessing this will depend on the individual way you walk and the shape of your foot. The flaps have relaxed a little, but I don't see them falling down anytime in the near future. Since purchasing these boots about a month ago, I have worn them almost daily and couldn't be more pleased. The taupe leather is beautiful and I would love to add more colors to my collection!",5
548617,"Cute pattern. Would have been great maternity panties. Not true to size though. I bought 2x. Should have been plenty big enough. While they did fit on my belly, they did not fit in the leg holes. Those elastic spots were TIGHT. Like painful, cutting my skin tight. The top elastic band above the belly also had a similar issue. Not as tight, but definitely not comfortable.",2
346887,"For the price its a great dress, but I ordered the Med - which actually says small and its very stretchy. I am 5`4 - 145lbs - 34c and somewhat plump in the booty area. I probably will not end up wearing it since it doesn't attenuate my tiny waist that I've worked so hard for..",3
483008,"they are nice, I would have liked them if they fit better, they were way to narrow, I had to use a shoe streatcher just to be able to wear them, and then just barely. they were to narrow, and a little to short. but I have wide feet and am a half shoe size bigger than what I ordered. so maybe more size options. I would absolutely buy them again if they had them in my size.",4
615545,This was so super cute! I loved receiving this shirt with a love note from the company with care instructions and information about the production. It would have been nice to see a photo of a model wearing it before I purchased it. I did not realize it was form fitting but it was still super cute.,4
391389,"I am very small busted & was hoping to add a little to my cup size. I don't think I would ever wear them in a swimsuit for fear they would fall out. I have used them in my bra, but they don't fit in my bra real well. You can see part of them sticking out. Maybe they would work better in a different bra.",3
678112,"When I got the shirt it was a lot better than I was expecting after I read the reviews. I usually wear a small and that's what I ordered. with how wide the torso is I would have preferred to go with a small because I have a tiny waist but think the shoulders would have been too snug. The material felt nice. It looked nice, slightly tailored. Not as bad as s lot of girls button downs for this price, that's for sure. I bought the plum colored purple and got lots of compliments on the color.",4
24791,"This is a routine purchase for my husband for every pair of shoes he gets. He was originally fit with these at the New Balance store.

238546,"1 piece missing. 1 piece with a dent. Quite a few had cloydy (not-so-shiny) look, 1 piece had scratches. The color was far from rose gold. Totally disappointed and would not recommend at all.

Just to add, I'm a happy Amazon shopper usually. It's so unlike me that I had a product that did not meet my expectation.",1
128030,"Nice quality.  I bought a medium...tiny bit tight across back/shoulders, but I think a large would be too big.  (5' 6""  130#)  The red is pretty.  I like the way the hood fits so I can see out, and yet be protected.  I've not been able to test it in a good rain, but like the way it folds up compactly.",4
161248,"Sorry, just did not fit my short chubby legs.  Gave them to a friends 8 year old daughter and she loves them.  It has gotten cold around here and they go up almost to her middle.  She says its like wearing winter underwear without the extra panty.  LOL  Kids do say the darnedest things.",3
109058,"Fox Performance is great company to work with that puts there customers first. I would not hesitate to order products supplied by this company in the future. As far as the XKD's go, they are great for us bikers with a big skull. They look good while protecting your eyes from the wind, sun and flying objects.
Thanks Fox Performance,",5
84107,First of all this is a great product to purchase and consider as a universal card holder. The leather feels authentic and the build is very solid with quality lacking on nothing. The benefit is that this is a classy alternative to a wallet as you are able to hold many cards as once. My only drawback is that it holds less cards than my wallet. I can 6 cards in NY wallet and this holds 5 cards tightly. Alsmot perfect but it needs to hold more cards while being thinner.,4
503685,"I chose not to keep these sun glasses because they were a little tight above my ears (but my head is on the larger side). They are 13.5 mm across from hinge to hinge. I really liked the look- especially the color of red/black. They arrived with a little scratch on them (see picture). They don't feel super sturdy, but that doesn't mean they would break easily.",4
774006,"Great company, it arrived really fast. Like 3 weeks fast. Shirts fit perfect too, and are very well made. Im very happy all the way around and will order may more. The order came with stickers and other cool stuff, also a discount for future orders. Such an awesome guy! Thanks again!",5
38962,"It was larger than I had anticipated. I ordered a 2XL (for waist 44in) but I guess an XL would have been OK too. Anyway, I just wear it at home. It is super comfortable and warm. I have worn these outside with 5 Fahrenheit without any problems. I would have given it 5 stars if it had pockets. Sometimes when you have to step out briefly a quick chore, you miss having a pocket.",4
646192,"Bought these for my mother for Christmas. She has a lighter, thinner pair of Snoozies more appropriate for summer that she loves. I got her these because she had mentioned she wanted a fleece-lined pair of Snoozies but couldn't find a pair in stores with a pattern she liked. This design is right up her alley and she wears these around the house all the time. She thinks they're very comfortable and warm.",5
398993,"The price was great! I bought them for my boyfriend, he loved them. They are a bit snug, but I'm sure after wearing them they will work their self out. They arived fast which was great. My only problem was that they do not look as they do in the picture. They were not chained nor did they have the designs as shown, they just look like regular creepers. None the less we both like them so I'm not broken up about not getting as shown. I love creepers and I loved the price. The quality is great also.",4
471965,"I'm 5'6, 125 lbs. I trip on this dress in 4"" heels.  Because of the pattern,  I'm not sure how to hem this or bring the length up at the waist so I can wear it. My husband loves it on me, but it's a broken nose waiting to happen.  Wish they would make a regular and tall version.",4
404325,"With age and arthritis, my original wedding band became dangerously tight and could not be resized.  I initially bought a titanium ring but was very disappointed that it looked scratched and old after only a few weeks.  I am very physically active, but that was rediculous.  I have had this ring for 9 months and it still looks just like it did the first time I put it on.",5
350962,"I loved this wig and received so many compliments! The reason for the 4 stars was that I had to brush out some of the back combing and trim some of the hair at the base - it looked like when they sewed the hair in they didn't do it right so where the part is I had 1/4"" to 1/2"" of hair sticking out (think of when a 4 year old decides it's a good idea to cut there own bangs, it looked a little like that)",4

We r big Vans fans so we will return and order the 3, 3.5, and 4s whichever one fits we will keep and return the rest. Its a waist of everones time and money. Vans needs more post product testing.",2
727948,"My wife loves the way this case looks and feels.  It is slim and almost feels like it was designed to be part of the phone. It uses the natural color of the Rosegold tint to accentuate the features of the case itself.

 It's really easy to handle and has these neat little gems on the back. I would recommend this case.

I received this product at a discount for my honest review.",5
293523,I bought these for Halloween. I wear a size 8 in pants and I bought the Medium/Large (8-12) because the Small/Medium (4-8) scared me. They fit but a bit larger than anticipated. I had to keep pulling them up. The length is also a bit longer than Capri length (possibly because the size was a bit larger). Definitely do not wear black undies with this color.,3
223383,Kind of disappointed. I love the front of the shirt that's why I ordered it but upon receiving it the back of the shirt looks kind of awkward. I don't like it so much. I haven't wore it yet bcuz I'm still trying to figure out how I can alter it to make it look cute. I give it three stars bcuz they did not have a pic of the back,3
559418,I normally wear a 2X but some brands are too tight so I get them as high as 3X.  I bought this brand in a 2X because the reviews said they ran a little larger which I like.  I think I have finally found a brand with sizes that run true and not really larger!,5

419030,First of all I never write reviews second I opened the box for the first time in my car in the dark! And the ring sparkled like it was in the sun! I loved it! And when I got home and saw it in the light I loved it even more! Its perfect! The picture seriously doesn't do it justice it looks so much better in person! I would definitely recommend this ring and this jeweler to everyone I know :) couldn't be happier,5
533444,"I love this shirt, the quality of fabric is sooo nice, thick but not overly so, and soft. The fit is great,I ordered a 3x as I'm plus size. And, it fits very nicely. I've gotten so many compliments on it. If there was one criticism, and its a tiny one, it's that I wish it were a smidge longer. But, other than that, great!",4

The leather is folded over, center stitched, and does not have a fabric backing. For the price it cant be beat!",5
688233,"I bought this shirt expecting it to be as seen in the picture, it's not what you would expect. The star wars design is much smaller than shown here, not even half of what you see.

It was misshapen when it arrived and after many attempts to make it work, we will have to buy a different mask.

We have already picked out a different mask to use with the costume.",2
881460,"This top has side slits, and the hem located here was not done correctly.  Due to this, the hem does not lay flat, but flips up on both sides.

One that I hadn't worn in over a year and a half which I presumed had died.  All three watches are now fully operational, keeping great time and obtaining the accurate time from the Atomic clock.

877481,I expected this to run super fitted and I was right. I ordered one size up because I am not a fan of tight tops. I wear 34/36 B bra and ordered the large. This is perfect to wear under the trendy semi sheer tops and tops with the low arm holes. Adding another layer would be too warm for me in AZ and usually bras won't cut it in those types of tops. This one fits the bill. I got the white and light gray - would love to find these in more exciting colors. :),5

77904,"These are perfect - great for a Southern princess.  I purchased for my 2-year-old, and they are big, not not overwhelming if you are into the look of a big bow.  Have purchased similar bows for twice the price at boutiques and at craft fairs.  I would buy these again and again.",5
174176,"Love this necklace. I'm giving it 4 stars due to the fact that some of the connecting pieces are a bit loose,  but aren't hard to tighten with jewelry pliers. For the price,  I have to say this is a heck of a deal as it goes with everything!",4
198988,"Love the shoes, they are adorable... but run small. My son normally wears a 12, I ordered a 12.5 and couldn't even get his foot half way in. He does have flat feet, so they may just be too narrow... but I've never had any problems with other shoe brands in the past. We don't purchase wide styled shoes, just regular... and have purchased DC shoes in the past that have fit him fine. It just seems to be this specific shoe. Hope this helps!",3
79790,"Just got it in and I really love the look of the bracelet. I wasn't sure when I ordered if I would but it's very nice.
still need to take links out just have not had a chance to do it yet. Tried once but couldn't do it and have not had time
to study how to do it.",4
477437,"It fits true to size and is pretty warm. There are holes, so you may need to wear a camisole under it. The side pocket is tilted for a playful touch of creativity. I love it, because no one else has one like it. When I want clothing that's extraordinary, I shop on Amazon.",5
842452,"I really wanted to love this dress. I bought it in anticipation of a vacation to Puerto Rico and hoped to find a breezy comfortable dress to put on while sight seeing. I ordered a medium based on other reviews and the size chart - I am 5'6, 145lbs, 34G. The material is light and airy, the color fun and bright. It just wasn't a flattering dress on me. I tried it with and without a small belt. It made me feel wide and chunky. I regretfully returned it.",2
882636,"Very nice bathing suit, fit as expected, seems to be well constructed, and it is very flattering for my plus-size, pear-shaped figure. The pattern draws the eye up, and the skirt length is good for those of us who like a little extra modesty. The only thing I would change is the short length. They're too short and hit my thigh at the thickest point, which makes them roll up to where they may as well not be shorts. However they're still full coverage.",5
628690,Awesome bra. I was so nervous that I was going to get cheap junk for how much it costs but I was so pleasantly surprised when I tried on. I'm a 34 D in Maidenform brand bras but a 34 C with this one. I was looking for a bra that wouldn't restrict too much but wouldn't look dumpy either... this is the happy medium. So happy with this purchase!,5
867125,"Beautiful dress but it was too small. I'm a size 4 US and it was too small, maybe order a size or two up? Also you can see through the back. Even with nude underwear you can still see everything. I don't like to wear slips under my dresses. I had to return it which sucks because it's so cute.",3
399579,"I loved this when I breastfed my first daughter so I bought some more for my second time around.  It is very comfortable and the pull down design provides easy access to breastfeeding.  Great to sleep in.  However, since you have to pull it over your head to put it on and off, it does get stretched.  The material does give in after awhile to the constant stretching (holes and lose stitching).  It's basically a sports bra design but without the support.",3
283031,"This bathing suit is so cute and flattering. I wish you could order different sizes though- the top is a little on the small side for me but the bigger size was too big on the bottom. I'll take excess cleavage over a saggy bottom any day, but if I could have ordered different sizes for the top and bottom I would have given this 5 stars.",4
485365,This dress is well made. I sent in my measurements and it fit beautifully.  Because of the corset I didn't need to wear a bra and the girls were up all night.  I did need to hem as there was a ton of fabric.  You can even make a wrap it you wanted.  It took FOREVER to come so order at least 3 months in advance. I did wish unordered in another color though.  I recommend!,4
366067,"I absolutely love this, it looks exactly like the picture. Luckily I read the reviews, so I know the sizing is weird. I ordered a US small and a US medium (the tags that came in said the products were medium and large but that's because it's asian sizing). The small bottom was one size too tight, but the small top fit me perfectly. So basically, I fit perfectly into a US small top and a US medium bottom. I'm 5'2"", 130lbs, 32D or 34C",4
11939,Very comfortable! Was looking for something similar to Superfeet without the higher price and I think I have found it. Working on my feet 8 hours a day destroys my shoes and insoles quick so I will be coming back for these when this pair can take no more abuse.,5
53139,"I like the large brim as it keeps baby's face and neck shaded.  I don't think it started to fit until about 3M because we couldn't tighten it up enough to keep it from slipping forward, and at 6M there is still a little room to grow, but not much.  Even though baby's head got a little sweaty (and on a 90 degree day, who's head isn't a little sweaty) this hat was perfect to protect my little guy's delicate skin.  I will get another one in the next size up as he grows.",4
651443,"My wife and I love the outdoors and we bought these rings to wear while we go kayaking, hiking, camping, swimming, etc. I've done all those things in the two years we've owned them and they're still with us. They're comfortable and lightweight. Mine's slipped off a couple times while my hands were lathered up with soap and water, but hey, if it gets lost, then it has served its purpose and saved the real thing!",5

First, I opened it up to smell the most awful smell and when I tried to wash it with high-fragrance laundry detergent it still smells after 3 washes!!! Second, it is extremely small and tight and horribly unflattering. I do not recommend this product.",1
497437,"I ordered a XL for my husband (his normal size) and when it arrived, it was HUGE! It looked like a 2XL. I called and asked if I could exchange it and they are not only going to exchange it, but let me keep the original. This is great because I don't have to go through the hassle of packing it up and sending it off. Callie was an awesome CSR and cafepress has kept my business for sure!",5
582209,I was wearing this on a nice indoor day party and i noticed The fabric absorbs sweat and it shows. The crotch area is a little off measured. It doesnt go with the sizes of the arm and the length of the legs. Its as if its for people with short upper bodies. You have to stretch it out.,3
497340,Does the job! Looks great . Make sure you want a very full looking skirt though. I only returned it because I had to return the dress I bought it for. The velcro could be better to hold it together around waist but that can be easily fixed if you had to.,4
652805,"It's very cute! Now I just got to get up the nerve to get my belly button pierced again. It was pierced when I was in high school, but has since closed. I'm 54 now and it may shock and seem outrageous to some, but I'm thinking what the heck! I'm old enough now to do what I want and not care what anyone thinks anymore. One of the only good things about growing old ladies! Lol",5
717494,"I'm 5'10"" and 175lbs.
 Ordered an 2XL size using their chart. What I received claimed to be a 2XL but was mislabeled, and wrong item.
It barely fit and whose chest and shoulder measurements were 26"" circumference, So obviously for a child.

Material was similar to a heavy gauge hoodie material

HOWEVER, they people were kind enough to shoot me a label and conduct the return quickly.",2
820532,"I weigh just over 200 lbs and am 5'4"", I ordered an XXL as I wanted it to be loose and flowy. It fits very well, is exactly as I expected. It just covers my bottom, so is perfect for wearing with leggings. The fabric is good quality, you can't see through it. The sleeves end in elastic, which is slightly too tight, but isn't constricting.",5

The same with 2 blouse I will never order from these 2 company's again don't waist your money on this looks good but you will be dissapointed.,1
280506,"the adjustable straps are not too long, which is sometimes a problem.  The strap over the toes doesn't dig into your foot when you walk, another problem I've had.  And the straps are nowhere near where your bunion would be if you have one like I do!  Very, very comfortable and attractive.",5
510530,"Fits my wife's bracelet beautifully, and if she chose to, she could wear it as a necklace as well.  I was happy to find this because dragonflies are special to her.  She is very happy with it, and I'm happy it arrived so quickly since it was a gift.",5
306760,"I got this for baby to wear to my sisters wedding and its perfect. He wears 12-18 month clothes regularly and the 12/18 mo size fit him fine here too. The sleeves are a little long and the pants a little shorter than i would like Iike. As many others have said, the crotch doesnt stay snapped close. Ill probably replace those with better snaps before the wedding. But i gave it 4 starts because it is adorable and easy for baby to move in.",4
534725,"Ok, for a $30 dress... AMAZING! As other reviews pointed out there are a few imperfections. One side seam is stitched loose,  the top portion to waist is on the shorter side, a few spots of the hem is undone.

It is beautiful and surprisingly well made. no lie, buy it and you won't regret it! I am 6' 145lbs and ordered an XXL

thirty.dollars.equals.awesomeness!",5
859498,This dress is amazing! It is cute yet classy. It was cheap price wise so I thought it would be kinda low quality but I was blown away. The inside lining is like a satin material which makes it very comfortable to wear. The material is a little heavier in weight which I actually really liked. GO BY THE SIZE CHART IN THE DRESS PICTURES!! If you use that size chart instead of the Amazon one it fits perfect.,5
883113,"Cute shirt, well enough made and good quality fabric. However, if you lift up your arms even slightly, it pops up off your shoulders. I lack the charisma and patients to be so 'lady like' as to never lift my arm ever so slightly. It is going to be returned..",3
212697,"Very authentic.  High quality material and well made.  I am glad I did not have to bring this back in my suitcase from Germany because of weight and space.  Perfect fit and suspender straps are adjustable.  The only challenge for me is that I have a short torso and after the suspender straps are adjusted, the straps hang with a lot of excess.  Therefore, do I just shorten the excess straps with a scissors cut or will I ruin the leather and the sewing?",5
438634,"This vest is great. If you go by the sizing chart, order a size up and go by your height for best results. I originally ordered black, and I definitely plan on getting more colors. You can't go wrong with there vest. Just remember its slim fit so order by your height and a size up on your weight!!",5

I am transitioning from the mini-mil that Tactical Research makes into this mini-mil transitional boot and couldn't be more impressed with what a slight difference makes.

The ""pleather"" loop looks like it would be too small, but it fits perfectly on my work belt which I believe is 1 1/2"".  The metal clip seems to be well made and secure.  I'll know more once I use it at work, but as of now, I am pleased with this item.  The free shipping was a nice bonus as well.",4
417615,I have purchased these many times for my daughter and sister.  They both use these as casual/walking shoes though my daughter also uses these for work in the ER where she is on her feet all day as well as for various sports.  They both love the comfort and cushion these shoes provide!  And they are super cute!,5
860391,"Love this tank top, I'm a medium but buy large because I prefer a loose fit tshirt. The other reviews said they are true to size so I went with size large. came in folded nicely in a bag, it fit great and l love the material. I'm 5ft 5in 150ish with a 34c top to help give you an idea. I coud have fit in a medium but it would have been tight and I wanted to feel comfortable to wear in public.",5

776767,I received this shirt about a month ago and I like the way it looks and fits. I am a tall and thin person so the sleeves were a bit short but that's expected with my frame. The colors on the shirt have not faded after multiple washes and I highly recommend this shirt!,4
48849,"I like the crown. It is good looking and fairly sturdy but does not sit well on the kids heads. It is a bit wobbly and with any movement it tends to fall off. The depth of the crown is fairly shallow (I guess it is correct in that this is what crowns are supposed to do, but kids need a more secure fitting) and it makes it wobbly.

It looks really good but because of the wobbliness, the kids did not really like it. It made playing with it not as much fun as it could have been.",3
192072,"I got these for a pajama party and they are cute. They run a bit large but after washing and drying on low they shrunk a bit so they are better. The construction is not very well made. I feel like they will rip easily since the stitching is fairly flimsy. If you are getting these to wear as regular pj's, I would move on. For a party, they are cute.",3
329882,"The fabric is my favorite part of the shirt it's super soft and feels really good. I bought a large and it fit but I feel like I would've been better off getting an xl for this particular shirt it doesn't ""flow""(?) the way it seemed like it would. Lol I don't know if this will help but in general I like the shirt it's really nice.",4
257041,"While I can only wear this in the privacy of my backyard, I think it's pretty. It's too thin to wear in public and the waist part rolls no matter how loose or tight I tie it.

406666,"It's a beautiful watch with very good quality.

But I gave 4 stars because the leather strap is too short for a wrist above average size like mine. It's still too tight even after I made an extra hole.

So if you have a large wrist this is not for you, unfortunately.
But despite of this, it's a very nice watch and it keeps good time.",4
60661,"Beautiful!  I did not realize what a quality product I was getting.  This came in a sleek gift box although I bought it for myself We hold our keys throughout the day.  It makes sense to have a stylish, quality product each time you reach for it. The key chain easily equals those that cost twice as much.  Love this product!  Keep up the good work!",5
289071,"Really fun and a good quality.  A few of the graphics are lost by being higher up the ankle, but I had fun embellishing Wasington with a pink hat so someone will get a laugh (no offense intended) if they catch a glimpse.  May be too large for women with size 8 and smaller feet.",4

Different pouch construction, different (and tighter) elastic in waistband and legs. Basically it is not the same product, and it is no longer satisfactory for me. Why change a comfortable and successful design?",2
716590,I thought this dress was absolutely beautiful I didn't write a review when I bought it but. I bought it in 2016. There were some minor details I didn't like for 1 the beading doesnt go all the way behind the back. 2. The dress is way to long so I suggest you hem it up. And 3 the straps were way to lose and theres not way to tighten them up I used safety pins to fix it. But I really did love the dress.,4
180828,This jacket is adorable! Looks great with pretty much everything. I read the reviews and knew that I wasn't going to zip up the jacket (I like the open look better) so I ordered it just one size up.

Very happy with this purchase.,5
225824,"I wear an 8 or 10, but based on the reviews I ordered a large.  The waist band is too small .  Otherwise it is a well made skirt.  The length is as expected,  I have not sent it back  I think the waist measurement in inches should be in the description for each size.  the remainder of the skirt is beautiful.",2
103407,"Love the style...top is as seen here. Just buy a size up. NB: If u wear fussy hair styles or braid, this top is not for u because the neckline is very narrow and not stretchy so u have to pull on this top before u comb your hair and before make-up",4
268273,"Just received this and was immediately thrilled at the quality and size! It's exactly what I was hoping for as a replacement to my wallet that can still hold my phone and keys, acting as a little purse when needed. It's so slim and light and fits perfectly into my tote!",5

I love that it is lightweight, too. It's perfect for the hot summers where I live. Granted, this shirt IS a bit see-through, so I'd highly recommend wearing an undershirt unless you want everyone to see the pattern of your bra! I would certainly buy this brand (in other patterns) again!",5

32380,"It's not as warm as I would have imagined it to be, and is in fact rather thin material. However, it is a perfect spring/fall hat. It will take some serious head shaping to get it used to the way your head is settled within but otherwise is a great little hat for all casual occasions. It may also be kind of thin but I found myself quite warm inside of it because it is a Wool blend. Do not underestimate this cozy little hat for the price that it is offered as.",4
691565,This is a well made product. The design though should have made more room in the front. I purchased the XX large. I usually fit a US large . Even though the material is comfortable it was kinda tight in front. I'm not big and it was snug. I guess if you have more of a package up front the material will streach to form a larger pouch if you don't mind the snug fit.,4
713906,"These pants arrived much earlier than expected.  Hooray!  I really like them, so am going to get them in several more colors.  I am a petite, and the length was perfect.  I took the advice and got them 1 size larger than normal.  I hate baggy, wide legged, short crotch pants, and these are slim legged and up to the waist.  They make me look and feel like the petite person that I am.",5
163343,"I bought these to hold up my socks when I wear boots.  This, in turn, prevents the top of the boots from chafing against my legs.  These do a pretty good job.  They occasionally let go of the sock, or slide past my calves, but that isn't too big of a deal.",4
265646,"I am normally a medium ordered a large fits nicely. If you are tall like me (5'9"") it may ride a little to high for comfort on the butt, it doesn't bother me though. Super sexy, my only complaint is that it didn't come with the model in the pictures boobs, alas that is my fault and not the suits'.",5
707954,"When I first received this, I loved the overall design and was excited to wear it. It came sort of clumped up in its bag with a couple beads broken off but I did not mind. If you buy this you need to be very careful how you store it! WhenI took it out of the package to wear it for the first time, it had broken in half from the bottom piece. Not worth the price to return.",2
430154,"These are too large....the balls are pretty big (heh, heh) and the bar is too long. Normally you go and get your jewelry switched out after the swelling goes down after the piercing is done, but these are basically the size of the original jewelry you get to accommodate for your tongue swelling up. I tried screwing on the ball to the shorter bar I use, but the balls are  just too big (haha, I'm a little immature over here).",2
397104,"I own four of these. I'm very glad of it, because they no longer sell them in my size. Again I have to begin a search for that most elusive thing - a comfortable bra that does what it's supposed to do. As to this bra though, even if you don't care about the minimizing effect, it's comfortable, supportive, and doesn't wear like body armor.",5
418359,"Was super excited to get these sandals and reminisce about my childhood days wearing the checkerboard shoes every where I went. The first couple months were great, a little small but then they were worked in and fit fine and they look great. But start of the third  month I noticed that the sandal started to fall apart at the bottom. The grip on the bottom started to completely separate from the sandal, really disappointed... I love Vans products and want to order a new pair but figure it will just do the same thing... bummer",2
467976,I received this today without any bottoms.  Also the polka dots are bigger than what they look like in the picture and there are no smaller dots at all on the suit.  It is advertised as a pushup tankini but it did not push up any different tgan any other halter top tankini. RETURN!,1
389421,I love the design of this bathing suit so much I'm keeping it even though the bottoms are way to skimpy to wear. I have a charcoal grey bottom that matches it perfectly and I love the top so much I'm keeping it even though I'll never wear the bottoms. I know why the model never turns around in the pictures.....her cheeks would be hanging out!,4
413079,"We ordered our older boy's pair straight from WSS because Amazon was out of stock with his size. He got his first and our 2 year old was so disappointed that he didn't have Superman shoes we had to immediately order him a pair. Luckily Amazon had his size and we got them very quickly.

Those boys want to wear these shoes every single day, so I guess they must be comfortable. Though I would say they run a little on the large size for toddler shoes. But little ones grow so quickly that is a short-lived problem.",5
179236,"Sure it's a bit dorky, until your friends begin to use them as well.  I have pairs everywhere, and they're better than all the chi chi types of sunglasses that don't really shield all your eye.  You can't go wrong with these, and they come in many colors, etc.  Start with one and you'll get it right away.",5
279935,"Really pretty piece and i love the elastic so you don't have to fiddle with a clasp.  Unfortunately its a piece of junk that falls apart.  The dangles fall right off.  Also, the dangles do not go all the way around - only half way , so the picture is an illusion",1
24288,I have retina problems and lenses with prisms. Acuity and weight are critical for me. I have quite a collection of clip ons. These are by far the best I have found. Excellent acuity in a range of light settings. The most lightweight I have found. They are living up to the hype.,5
119848,"First of all, this diaper is adorable!  It fit my small 5 month old and I'm sure it's the right size, but it did leave marks on her chubby little thighs.
She didn't poop while wearing it, so I can't comment on its ability to hold poop.  It washes easily.
I like the idea of reusable diapers, but I didn't like the red legs.  Disposable swim diapers don't leave those marks.
Overall, I recommend this diaper.",4
809411,Though the top is pretty but the inside top is sewn inside out and so it shows from the sleeves and looks like im wearing the inner tunic wrong. I requested the seller to send me another one however I still got it the same way and the sizing of each top is different and so is the material. I wish I returned it in the time frame and got my money back than another top sitting in my cupboard!,2
485334,I am 5'3 and this dress is pretty long I got really tall shoes to go with it and it is still incredibly long but I will just have to make due with it since this was a last minute purchase. It fits well though other than the length and it is a very beautiful dress. It also arrived in 2 days which was earlier than the estimated arrival date which was great.,4
460932,My niece is in 9th grade & she has a killer body. She's tall & she looks great in a jersey dresses. When I first opened this I thought Oh No I'm in Trouble bc it looked too narrow & possibly too small. I was wrong bc she was wearing it today on Christmas. She loved it!  She wears junior size 2-4. She is a huge cat lover. The cat picture was vibrant! This dress fit her like a glove. I want her body. lol,5
170550,My husband and I love this robe! I bought one for myself then 2 weeks later ordered one for him. It is very similar to the robes we get to use at nice hotels. I had been wanting a robe like the Omni has but didn't want to spend so much. This robe is perfect. It is a little long and large but we love that.,5
305473,I got this as a Secret Santa gift for someone and was thoroughly pleased with it overall (as was the recipient of it). However before you give this to anyone I would inspect it first to make sure the little links are closed well or intact since they are very thin and malleable.,5
54018,"This hat is just what I was looking for. My baby is well protected from the sun. I ordered size 6-18 Months size for my 9 month old and it fits him well, the adjustable feature of this hat makes it possible to be used for quite some time.
I highly recommend it!",5
384006,"I typically wear a mens size L hat (noting this for size comparison only).  This hat was too small for me but for someone with a smaller head, this is a great find.  I was sad to have had to send it back.  The hat is very well made and is quite pretty.  It would make a great sun hat for anyone that could wear a hat similar to a mens size M.  If this hat came in a larger size, I would buy it in a heartbeat!",5
552870,"I love this set. It comes with a better looking chain than pictured. Mine came with a pretty rope style silver chain. The cats on the earrings measure a full inch, not counting the hook. The cat on the pendant measures about 1 3/4 inch. Bigger & better quality than I expected. I am satisfied with every piece I ordered from this seller & will probably order more items in the future. Worth the price & the wait!",5
236467,"I am more than pleased with this product. I don't care what anyone says about how silly it looks on my 7 month old. His head is protected, and if I want to place him on the floor to crawl, guess what I can without constantly following him making sure his head does not smack against the hard flooring. This this WONDERFUL! SAVED MY LO head from major blows!",5
254354,"Yes... the product extends and retracts just like all the cheap kid toy light sabers... this one has no sound.
Yes... it lights up, but the connection for the bulb is less than stellar and sometimes will go out if jostled.
As stated in other reviews the side blades do not retract.
The battery cover can pop out of place if dropped.
The size is definitely not a kids size toy... It is more adult size with child attributes.",2
418207,"The Silver Dragon jewelry was suggested to me by my mother, who already had a few pieces made by them. So i started looking at their stuff and found this lovely pendant and knew i had to have it. I love how the loop for the necklace is on the back of the dragon, making it sit just right. I have it on a 18in chain and have been given several compliments on how beautiful the pendant is. I am going to look for a bracelet made by The Silver Dragon soon.",5
469315,"I have bought this style of jacket from several different vendors, this one is by far the best fit and very well made. Of course the first thing I dropped carmel ice cream down the front, and figured I had already stained it for life, not so, it washed up beautifully. I love it, would recommend it to anyone, and will buy it again as soon as they become available.v",5
845059,I ordered this dress for a 35th Anniversary Masquerade Ball. I was on a limited time frame so I messaged the seller and let her know the day of the event. She was able to ship sooner and get the dress to me on time! The dress arrived and is beautiful! I cannot wait to wear it for the event! The quality is great and the dress fits perfect. I need dresses for these types of work frequently and will be sure to order another dress from them again!,5
242835,"In all honesty, I purchased this for a joke; my partner and I had been dating for only a few months and we decided, in jest, to tell my parents we were engaged.

With that being said, it's not bad at all for the cost. It was sized exactly as described, is very pretty, and the cost is quite low. If you're looking to get hitched on a budget, it's not a bad option at all!",5
322925,This Bodysocks - Inflatable Ride Me Unicorn is super cute.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the fan to inflate the costume is in kind of a weird place where it keeps getting blocked by my leg.  I like the band it back of the hat that helps it stay on.,4
53298,"Not good for water.  When wet the brim gets too floppy and it doesn't dry fast enough and can't squeeze enough water out to in-flop it. it flops in front of my baby's eyes so i had to pull it back on his head, but then what good is that?  Might as well get a hat that fits better and still allows for a good view of what's in front of him.",2
691015,"I was very disappointed in the quality, color and fit. The seams were uneven and poorly sewn; the color was a very dull unflattering  blue that looked cheap; and at 5'11, 140 lbs (size 8) I could barely get into a large- it looked like a poorly fitted shirt. I could not get it off fast enough.",1
274566,"I've been wearing a stingray skin ratchet belt I got from Thailand years ago and really like the micro adjustability. So when I saw these on Amazon, I thought I try a different leather & buckle style. It turns out I gave it away as a gift so never got to try it, but the presentation box is high class, and the leather and buckle look very nice. I'm going to order one now for myself.",5
878886,"Firstly, that glossy ring in the picture? That's a lie. The ring I received is brown with a non-bright silver head. I don't have time to return it, however, since I need to attempt to give this as a birthday gift. The people who sold me this are crappy for putting me in this crappy situation.",1
378213,"This dress would've been really cute to wear if it wasn't for the fact that it was too big on me. The pictures didn't show the back detail so I was surprised that it was actually a lace type kind of back. When I did lace it, it looked kind of odd so I wish I had a picture to reference. Other than that, I think it would've been a nice dress if it did fit",3
668824,This was an accidental 1 click purchase and when i reviewed it I figured id get it instead of canceling and going through all that. It was a good accidental click for sure!! Very nice material. Perfect bag for my 10yr old. Lots of pockets and put together well. I will update if there is any issues but as of now im 100% satisified.,5
180686,"Too small is an understatement...I ordered a women's large, which the size chart said 12-14...I couldn't even get it on.  The jacket was so short, well over my belly button, that I couldn't keep this, even if I could get it over my arms.  I did like the jacket, very cute.  Just wish it wasn't made for children.",1
335866,"This is just what I was l looking for. This skirt is perfect for casual wear. The split ends just above the knee and doesn't show too much skin. While it is long, I pulled the skirt up a bit in the waist to keep it from dragging. I plan to purchase the teal and mocha.

I am giving my unbiased review in exchange for a discount on this product.",5
349435,"THESE SHOES  ARE GREAT,  WEAR THEM OUT IN  THE GARDEN  AND EVEN ORDERED  SEVERAL OTHERS , ONE PAIR FOR IN THE HOUSE AND 2 PAIRS FOR MY DAUGHTER SHE LOVES THEM ALSO.  CAN NOT BEAT THE PRICE , ARE WELL MADE,  REALLY HELP IN NOT SLIPPING AND FALLING  GOOD TRACTION.  TRY THEM YOU WILL BE PLEASED.",5
181803,"This watchband looks good but its going to cost around 15-20 dollars to purchase pins to install the band on your watch. The two included loops to hold down the excess band kept sliding off.  Super annoying. Then on the same day as I spent the 17 dollars installation, the clasp and tongue disintegrated rendering the band useless so I immediately asked and got a refund. I didn't get my expense of pins and installation refunded however. I am very disappointed and would recommend that you pass on this product.",1
54809,"Cool looking cap, very casual and contemporary. The light materials doesn't get your head all sweaty. The only problem is that the elastic band is too tight and no way it fits ""up to an XL"" as advertised. Not sure what hat size I am (I'm 5'9"" @ 160lbs) but the cap is very snug; I actually cut the elastic band and now fits fine. Aside from that, decent product.",3
57975,"We purchased this outfit after looking at a few stores and different online stores and couldn't be more pleased with our choice. This outfit ran kind of small, our son was 7 months at the time and we selected (Large)12-18 months and it fit perfectly and well the price was unbeatable!",5
447780,"These were a gift for my husband.  They are nice a thick and the design seems like it's not going to fade.  I will say though that after 2 washes, they have become pretty tight even though he's a fit dude.  They're too tight for him to wear these all day without doing damage to his circulation.",2
241182,Great ring especially for the price! My husband's original wedding ring kept scratching everything and so we needed a replacement. We tried a couple of different rings on Amazon and all we're not durable. This ring has held up great for almost a month of hard wear and tear from my husband's job. I would recommend this product.,5
26568,"My job requires me to wear dress shoes every day.  No matter what shoes I buy, the soles are always thin and provide next to no cushion.  It was getting to the point where my knees were starting to ache.  These inserts fit perfectly into my dress shoes and since I started using them I noticed I my knee aches have gone away.  They provide great cushioning and arch support.",5
289252,"So I actually bought this without realizing these were supposed to be men's socks, but they actually fit me perfectly! I wear a women's size 9 shoe, I'm not sure how that would translate to men's sizing. I would take off a point for seemingly not being able to fit men, but hey they do work for me perfectly. The artwork is super fun and well done. (The bump in my photo is caused by my leggings not the sock)",5
866414,"What a gorgeous dress!

Im 5ft tall, 123lbs and 29in waist...I purchased the burgundy in small...

The dress comes down to the floor for me, because you know, Im a shorty...but that doesn't bother me, the dress is beautiful...I wore it out to the store day I got it in the mail. It fits and looks exactly as it does on the model, which everyone knows can be pretty rare on Amazon. The material is thin, but not like, CHEAP thin, just thin...I will definitely be getting the other two colors!!!",5
229121,Fits larger than expected. I read the reviews so I ordered a size smaller than I normally would and that was even too big. I am wearing it for a Tacky Christmas event so the fit is ok but if I wanted it for a cute outfit I would return it and get 2 sizes smaller. I normally wear a medium and I ordered a small,4
404625,Awesome boots!! My 4 1/2 year old loves them!! Great price & great communication from the seller. They even come in a cute little box!! My son was sooo excited when he saw them and couldn't wait to put then on. They fit true to size & look exactly as the picture listed. Would definitely buy again as a gift or when my son's foot grows!!,5
233419,"Wow this is a beautiful pendant. I have had many compliments when I wear it.  It is quite unusual and draws a lot of attention to itself.  The stone is the exact color show in the ad and it floats nicely just below chocked level on my neck.  The package arrived on time and was well padded.  I will buy from this company again

I go this at a reduced cost I exchange for an unbiased opinion.",5
502373,"I been looking for a long time for a normal pair of Air Jordan's. Not the crazy looking 10 different colors & crazy looking alligator/snake skin type designs. This shoe was perfect, just wish there were no tiny holes on the tip/top of the shoes. I think it would have looked even better without that. I like these so much i think i may try to get the black pair next for backup.",5
42050,"I am definitely a ""pockets purse"" person.  The design of the purse is such that the pockets allow for good arrangement of the contents and easy accesibility...no digging around the bottom to find something.  The feel of the purse is very nice.  The strap is adjustable but feels a bit thin.  Hopefully, it will hold up well.  The overall construction of the purse is very good.",4
877552,"Love the way these look, I always get compliments on them and they look great. However, they sit too low on my waist and fall throughout the day, I am always pulling them back up but they aren't too big, they are too small I think? They gap between my thighs when they fall and overall are uncomfortable. I wish they were high waisted as that would solve the problem I think.",3
622918,"Loved it so much I bought the other color.
I am top heavy so finding dresses that don't end up looking like a sack is not easy.  This dress tapered very well while still giving me room up top.

A very pretty dress that comes across daytime casual. I get compliments on it very frequently, which is the best feeling.",5
581818,the top fits like a med not LG the bottom fits great tho top is way my shorter then it looks in pic but it is the same outfit u see to a T the sizes are off tho top not gonna match the bottom in size and I don't have triple D's Brest lolol but it is a nice sexy outfit tho and it came fast too so that's a plus,3
528150,"I bought these for my husband who stands on his feet all day teaching high school students.  He usually wears Chucks, but really needed something more comfortable and something that handled foot sweat better (TMI).  From the first day he wore these he said they are much more comfortable and that he can really tell the difference for his feet...mind you this is not an easy man to please fashion wise.  Bonus - his high school students commented that they liked his shoes and asked if his wife would ""buy them some too"" :)",5
472611,"Cute and functional.  I love all the pockets, there are about 4-6 more on the inside.  I thought this purse would be too small,  but it is big enough for my needs. The pockects give so much organization, that it makes it easy to use this bag. Leather feels good also.",5
55721,"Wife bought me the coat. Great coat, it runs FULL size, if you are used to wearing skinny clothes this is not the coat for you. I'm 5ft 11 180 lbs 41 chest , bought a Medium . I wanted something I could layer under and still have full movement. Will wear for hiking around our place and need to have room for a sidearm underneath. Also wanted shoulder room for rifle shooting. Its perfect.

Tried the Helikon version first and the  armholes were too tight and tight across the back, also slimmer fit, could not layer anything.",5
407657,"I got this for my lip as a fake Monroe piercing and it was terrible. The magnet part is very uncomfortable and kept scratching against my tooth. Talking was terrible because it made the magnet slide down, making the whole fake piercing slide out of my mouth. The reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because I can definitely see it working well for another place. But as for the Monroe, it was terrible.",2
825500,"Obviously it doesn't look like the photo, those are the $90 BlackMilk leggings, however they are fairly close. The print is somewhat blurry, but not too terrible for the price.

The fit is good considering it's all off Asian sizes; The leggings quality is fair as well, they feel like athletic leggings than fashion which is fine with me. The red on the map is really vibrant too, so you notice the names like Dunland and Mirkwood.

Shipping was faster than Amazon predicted, arriving two weeks earlier than I was told. Care tag inside says hand wash and lay dry.",4
743504,"This hat is just as gorgeous as the picture.  Very bright colors and nice design.  The front part above the brim is fairly stiff but I'm sure it will soften with time.  This hat is sized well, it fits me about the same as any of my other hats from bigger name brands.  The only thing that is fairly disappointing is the black color on the underside of the brim.  It looks a bit weird next to all the the white and bright colors but I still love it.",5
695935,"The hem at the leg openings is too tight. My legs aren't skinny but not big, either. These probably fir skinny-legged folks just fine. I tried Hanes again but they no longer catalog their same boxer brief I've worn for years. I'm experimenting with other brands. So far Ekoauer makes some that fir and work well.",3
259075,"It's def snug and I could have gone up a size but hopefully this is the LAST summer I will need them!  If you're reading this, fingers crossed my girl PT soon!!

By snug I mean it leaves a ring around her leg and is a little tough to get on and def off (because, wet) but it hold EVERYTHING in.",5

838322,"I was thrilled to try this product for a slight discount. My husband wore it on the cruise, and it was a big hit. He loves it! We also live near the water. The material is high quality, as is the stitching. I can see this lasting a long time!",5
534702,"well like the heading states, it fits just fine. thou i did read the details first but other then that, even thou it's listed as an XXL it fits just fine like if it was one of my other jackets. but i like it and on top of that it looks pretty cool so I give it a plus on that....did kinda find it weird that everyone else wanted to try it on when it came in thou.....",5
291355,"Honestly, i won't be wearing the top or the bottom anytime soon. The top I can probably pair with jeans but it looks cheap and looks more like a unwired bra. I can see this looking fine with a nice jacket I guess but not without a cover up. It isn't pretty like that.

The skirt was cut in a weird way. It isn't straight across my waist and looks almost crookedly stitched at the top. Whatever it is- it doesn't flatter my body at all and isn't secure on my waist to be high waisted.",2
422015,"I wore it on my right hand middle finger and it sparkled beautifully and got quite a bit of attention, I liked that it sat flush on my finger and didn't catch on to anything. My hubby said it looks better from a distance, up close he felt it looked a little cheap",3

I would definitely recommend these shoes to others.",5

I even bought a new tiara b/c the one that came w/ the costume was gold & looked really cheap/tacky. The top was too big (not sized appropriately) & was even more tacky than the tiara. Definitely not worth the price... The costume did get to me by the expected delivery date, so that was a plus.",2
121958,"I really do like this it really lifts the butt up, its just really uncomfortable to wear i only wear it when im exercising and you can see it through your clothes, but if you do decide to get it make sure that its two sizes bigger than your size which i did from other comments on this, it runs really tight. But it does work though.",5
34376,Really fits well! I purchased to make my own catwoman Halloween costume and it is very flattering. I am 5'5'' and 130lbs and the small fit great (I was going to get the medium but went with the smaller size based on other reviews and glad I did). Everyone loved the costume and it turned out much better than one you would buy from a costume shop.,5
307677,"Pants run extremely long, I'm about 5' 8"" and had the pants hemmed 5 inches.  Fits and looks beautiful, lots of complements.  Travels very well.  I bought this in mocha for a morning-time wedding about 1300 miles from my home.  I expected to have to steam out wrinkles after I unpacked it, but that wasn't  necessary at all.  I'll probably buy this in navy blue also, so that I'm covered for 'fancy occasions' both morning and evening.",5
640978,"This strap is well made. There is substantial thickness without too much bulk. Be aware of your lug gap (the distance between the case and the spring bar between the lugs). If you don't have adequate room here, this strap will be too thick to fit.
Clasp is well made. The strap is actually a bit on the short side for my 7 3/4"" wrist, but it still fits on the 3rd to last hole.
Overall I'm satisfied, and looks good on my Seiko Sumo.",5
433056,"Came in a reasonable time. Exactly what I ordered. Shoes are very sexy. There is no option for size or color so you have to read the description in the title. That's why there are 100 of these when you sears for them, every one is a different size and color. Product title tells you what you need to know though.",5
400043,"These socks are pretty comfy and overall a good value. I did notice that the toes blow out fairly easily. The fact you get 3 pairs in this set is nice. Merino wool is some of the softest out there.

Overall these are good socks for the price.

Thank you for reading my review.",4
566561,"Dress was so short, it can barely be worn as a top.  Certainly not appropriate for a dress as it leaves several inches of underwear showing in the front.  It is loose and baggy, poorly made and I would highly recommend that it NOT BE BOUGHT!  A terrible waste of money and resources.",1
15371,"I use these for exercising in the gym and it took a few outings for my feet to adjust because of the pronounced support in the arches. Be forewarned - these are not ""cheap insoles"" but professional orthotic inserts; I have a history of plantar factitious and recommend purchase only if you need the appropriate support. These are very well made, structurally sound, comfortable, and effective although not necessarily ""right"" for everyone.",5
197812,"I ordered the medium bc I'm a size 3 in jeans and a size 32B in the bust. I don't have enough of boon to fill in the top. And my package arrived with creases in the bikini top. I love it, but I'm not happy about the delivery or that you can't order them separately.",3

It doesn't solve all the myriad of issues I have with my legs and feet but I don't get the pain in the top of my arches any longer (as long as I am wearing these) and so far they don't bind, cut or hurt my feet. I highly recommend trying them...you will LOVE them! I may need to buy more in case I wear these out. I've been wearing them daily for over a week and they are doing great!",5
407580,"The wallet is great, and still has that 'new leather smell,' even after using it for a few weeks. Although it's more of a bikers wallet, it functions well for my line of work, and holds up quite well in my pocket, where my old wallet kept getting squished and yielded to moisture. Although I do have to complain about how small the actual cash pocket is; I couldn't fit all the bills in it after I got paid for the week, so it seems this wallet is better suited for a few larger bills, rather than many smaller bills.",4
589431,"I wanted to love this bra - it's pretty & I love purple. The band & cup are true to size (I'm a US 32I / UK 32G), but unfortunately this bra provides no support whatsoever. My understanding is that surgically enhanced breasts don't require a whole lot of support so if that's you, this bra may be fine. If you have natural breasts, I wouldn't bother with this style. I only wear it around the house.",3
417753,"My daughter is obsessed with shoes and loves boots! These are super cute, but they do seem to run a little small. I could tell as soon as I took them out of the box. She wears an 8M in all other brands of shoes she has, but I will need to exchange these for a 9.",4
806484,"The quality of the dress is not great. The top is nice but the tulle is just thrown on.  Parts of the tulle were a good 6 inches longer than the rest.  There wasn't enough tulle to cover the skirt and I had to trim the sewing string since it hung off the dress.  It is poorly finished.  I wouldn't have my daughter wear it for birthday pictures or party, but it's cute for the house or every day wear.  My 2 yr old loves it.",3
775987,"I ordered 3 of these thinking our family would need them but we only need 1 and I have started using it with my pad; boy do I love it!!!  : )
The craftsmanship is second to none and I am a perfectionist about thing looking good and being very functional.

This little Tablet really is so sleek, and well put together and had everything that I know of that is needed to make using a pad easy.
Keep up the good work in filling the bill in every way possible plus looking very smart; I have a black one.

Sincerely,
Em",5
352558,"I ordered these for my bridesmaids and was pleasantly surprised by how nice they looked for the price. I can't speak to how long they lasted or the quality but they looked beautiful in my girls and at least lasted the night which is all I needed them to do. None of them have complained about them, but I'm not sure if they have worn them since.",5
222588,"Love this! My toddler is too big for traditional footless sleep sacks--so this one fits the bill perfectly. It's cozy, easy to wash and the design isn't ""babyish"". Love it!

Update: The zipper broke after a few months of wear. If they could just use a stronger zipper then this sleep sack would be perfect.",5
215458,"I ordered one of these tee shirts. It fit beautifully, is so very soft and washes so perfectly that I then purchased another in a different color. I also ordered the nightgown that I used as a bathing suit cover-up on a recent trip.
Not only are the shirts wonderful, but I was impressed by Fishers Finery very high quality packaging and accompanying literature.",5
638488,"Love it!  The material is very soft, high quality!  I'm a size 4/6, 36B. Usually I buy mediums, but I don't like big tshirts and according to the sizing, a small fit perfectly-- it's a loose fit.  It came in a week and a half-- quicker than expected!  Would definitely buy from again.",5
324712,"Love the Star Wars print and it's a good medium/heavy weight knit sweater. However, I usually wear Large (men's) sized items and it gives me enough wiggle room to default to for most manufacturers. However this fit more like a tight medium. I think an XL would work but they are currently out of stock.",4
749448,"I have purchase many products from Mystic Metals and am always happy with the quality. They are always true to size, unlike some stuff I've gotten from other companies on Amazon. The tapers are exactly as expected. I'm pleasantly surprised with the tunnels. I typically wear heavy stone plugs, so I didn't even need the tapers, moving only 1/16th of an inch up. The tunnels slid right in. Another good purchase from this company.",5
53837,"This product is adorable and I love that it has SPF in it. Problem is, regardless of good intentions, it will not stay on your baby's head once you get the slightest breeze. Even when you tie it under your baby's chin, if she will let you, and if you pull the drawstring, it will still come off.",2
397329,"This ring is very delicate in appearance and is comfortable, however, the gold is dull and somewhat bronze-like in color.

I cannot wear it next to my other white gold jewelry, as it just looks drab. I also have this same band in the 2.5mm width... shinier and brighter and much prettier, without being too wide. I highly recommend the wider version. You'll be pleased with that one.",3
421421,"Just arrived today, it was smaller than expected but not by much. Even though its tiny it feels very strong, the diamonds aren't flawless but what do you expect for the price? They aren't noticeably cloudy and I don't have the ""black"" diamond others seem to complain about. Looks great with my engagement ring.",5
534863,"It's pretty, and it has plenty of room for your credit cards, bills, and change.  it's a lot longer than I thought it would be.  It's almost too big for my small purse.  Shucks, I guess that means I'll have to go shopping for another purse ;)",4
67153,"I am so thrilled with this purchase.  Ironically, I didn't think the stone was real, so I took it to a jeweler to have a real stone put into the ring, only to find out that it was real!  I was so excited.  I never thought a real stone, so beautiful would be so inexpensive.  This is my engagement ring and I absolutely love it.  Everyone that sees it, says how beautiful and unique it is.  Thank you very much for making such a beautiful product available to me!!!",5
793929,This dress is very pretty and fit very well.  I was very surprised to discover that the back bodice of the dress did not have the  same lace and trim as the front.  That should have been shown with the description. As such I would not wear the dress w/o the jacket and for that reason I'm giving this a 4 star rather than 5 star rating.  My return was well handled and very promptly credited.  I would order from this company again but would ask to see all views before doing so.,4
730561,"I truly love these pants.  The only reason that I am giving it a 4 instead of a 5 is because they sent me the wrong color; (I got Navy Blue instead of Grey).  I decided to keep the blue because, let's face it, who doesn't need a nice pair of blue slacks.  Sadly, I can not find the grey on here, so... that is is.  But these slacks are pretty awesome.",4
458469,"The outside of the bag looks exactly like the pictures, but in inner part, which isn't showed, is crappy. The product I got has a hole at a corner inside, because it run out of cloth when the factory was making it. The seller was nice enough to refund me $5 to keep. I still like the bag in general. I fixed the hole by some sewing. For laptop users, 13' MacAir can be barely fit in this bag. With this price, having two ways wearing it is just so neat!",3
154625,Omg I lovvveeeee this headband. It shipped rather fast and fit perfectly! It was so cute and sooo warm. You definitely will not worry about cold ears while wearing this! I unfortunately lost mine while moving so I am for sure buying another. It a very cute look for winter and even a cold fall.,5
266214,"this garment did not even come with a tag to show the actual size, at this point am not even sure I received the correct size... the large is way too small.... who ever made it.. did a horrible job sewing it... it looks classy on picture... but when i received it... am like what d hell !!
I would not recommend anyone to buy this... its a rip off",2
187718,It was definitely smaller than I expected it to be but I'm not unhappy with it at all. I just had to make some minor adjustments after I ended ripping a small part while putting it on. Just be careful if you are a bigger size. I can wear this with so many different things it's definitely a must have for the not so average wardrobe.,4
669502,"Really cute and comfy, true to size BUT it started piling almost immediately(little balls all over) and looks horrible after wearing only once. Also the dye rubs off so there are patches on the shirt that are turning white and see through. I was really excited about this shirt at first but after wearing once I don't think I'll be wearing it again, very poor quality fabric. Sad that I paid so much for it",2
658768,The only problem is that they make the pic look like a contoured women's shirt (which is what I searched to begin with because I didn't want a big men's potato sack of a shirt); but it arrived as a large regular men's shirt. That is my only reason for not liking it.,1
773181,I am very happy with this purchased! No issues whatsoever. Very comfortable and very flattering! Im a size xs and thats what I purchased and they fit perfectly! They don't ride up when I run (purchased for running). They are definitely not compression but still fit snug without cutting off your breathing lol,5
234948,"The shirt is SO soft, its great. The lace actually covers the top 1/4 of the back, so your shoulders are pretty exposed too, which was a fun surprise. Overall, this shirt is very cute and fits good, but it is definately quite big for being ""XS"". It fits more like a medium.",4
16011,"Decently stale/manufactured smelling upon opening, but went away quickly upon letting it air for a few hours. But as far as a cheap, non-wool tallit goes, this is wonderful. I found it fit just fine (I am a solidly medium-sized woman, a bit above average height), and I'm so thrilled that I was able to finally find a cheap, non-Messianic tallit. It's very pretty and well-made considering the price. All in all, I'm extremely satisfied.",5
835437,"Love this swimsuit! The fabric and pattern are great. The top fits perfect. My only qualm is that I wish that the bottoms had a bit more fabric. They fit better than I expected, not super tight to give that puffy/muffin top look, but wish they came up a little more for coverage on the back and front side.

P.s. Don't mind the tan lines...bought this suit to work on that.",4
95645,These are great support pantyhose. And have been wearing support hose since the 60's when I started working and they were pretty expensive. A friend told me about Leggs and what a good price they were. I tried them and have never changed brands. I miss the cute little eggs though .,5
111333,"Nice shirt illustrating the meaning of life.
However.....
After 6 months of wearing it maybe 6 times or so,  the stitching in one of the sleaves has unwraveled.  Thus I have changed my review to a 1 star due to poor quality.  I did not put this shirt under any kind of stress at all.  I've never had a shirt come apart like this before.",1
549047,"Super cute and neat way to rock the cork trend.

LAUREN belts run small-ish.

I am a size 4.  I wanted to wear the belt low rise, across my hips, so I bought a medium.  It barely fits.

It is nicely made and the cork is holding up well.  No cracks so far.

I wanted a summer belt that was neutral but not boring.  This one definitely fits the bill.",5
327324,"Asian Manufacturers
Shame on you Amazon, for allowing the sale of such poor quality and ill-fitting clothes on your site!  The looks are so deceiving
and the reviews are terrible...  Why would you represent a company that only disappoints your customers and makes them go elsewhere to find good quality clothes that fit correctly?  The language is the first tip-off, then having to adjust your size to Asian measurements, followed by the reviews of the number of people that have gotten ripped off!  C'mon Amazon!!",1
196498,"I was looking for something classic for my daughter I Communion Day ( of course I will use white sweater). I usually wear size 0, 2 or XS, BUT with fitted non elastic Dresses I need S or 4, since they are made very tight on bust. And it fits great. It also looks like on pictures, and waves while I twirl, which my daughter loves ;-) The only missing accent is wide belt in royal blue: currently looking for one.",5
269022,"Wife wears a size 5 in U.S. Size. I read these shorts run small so I ordered an XXL, the largest size available. Must be XXL for toddlers, as they were so small she couldn't even get them on. Also, even if she could she would not have been able to button them, BECAUSE THERE WAS NO BUTTON HOLE! Buyer beware!",1
84313,Designed to hold business cards and is stylish.  My business cards are thick and more like a credit card so this holder is perfect and holds more than the average business card holder.  The red stitching on the leather exterior looks more pink and feminine.  I like this card holder and I've had many card holders but this one is the best of them all.,5
619220,"This is a fantastic suit for the price. The material is pretty good, and the style is really flattering. I'm 130lbs, 4'11, with relatively small thighs, but a thicker middle and a bit of a tummy, 34C/D, and the M fits me perfectly. My legs fit through the openings just fine, but I can see why those opening might be considered smaller as some other reviewers have said. The top fits me just fine and holds everything in well. I highly recommend this suit, especially at this price.",5
198630,I bought this for my granddaughter's 5th birthday.  She loves it.  When I first opened it I was surprised how large the beads are.  However it looks lovely on her and she is enjoying wearing both the necklace and bracelet.  It stretches and hasn't pinched her so far.  This set is much nicer than any others I have seen.,5
