150924,"This dress fit like a glove! I love it! It fit all my curves and was a sexy dinner option. My boyfriend loved it too! :D The material was comfortable, thick and soft to touch. Not itchy at all and I was able to move around with ease with this dress. It also came way before the time that it was expected to. Two thumbs up!",5
420687,"I read the other reviews on this jacket ,so I ordered a 2xl ...it's more like an XL the sleeves hang down past my finger tips ..but the thing nobody seemed to mention was that the zipper is on the left side of the jacket ,I grew up thinking this as a woman's jacket ?? It's not a deal breaker but sure is awkward to try and zip .....",2
59030,"Super cool looking wallet. I've been a huge comic book fan for 30+ years, so i was excited to use this wallet. It looks awesome, but it did not hold up at all inside. The interior material with the comic book print is very flimsy, and after about 7 months of use it fell apart. I didn't have an excessive number of cards in the wallet, it just was cheaply made. So, it looks awesome, but it's great for everyday use.",3
355574,"These reading glasses are nice, their lens do not distort print as some other types of lens tend to do.
The one thing that is less than satisfactory is the ear pieces are not long enough for me, barely reach my ears.
Other than that the glasses are worth the price and look nice too.",5
653215,"This skirt is quite nice. I enjoy wearing it but one thing could be improved is the stretchy liner underneath. It tends to ride up a bit. I haven't done it yet, but may eventually just remove the liner and wear a regular slip underneath. But overall this floral green design is wonderful.",4
467765,Just got my sabertooth patch. I really really like it a lot has to be the baddest patch I've seen. The real thing looks better than the picture. One thing I must point out to buyers; it does not come with the loop backing only one side only the hook side. I wish that it had as another patch I ordered because now I must find black hook and loop to stick it on my BDU sleeve. I can't deduct any stars for this but want folks to know.,5
855234,This product fit very well. I am usually a size 18 so I ordered an XXL and it fit great. I am also only 5'2 and the dress hit shortly below my knees. This also accents my form very well. I bought this product at a deeply discounted price. This dress also is of great quality and a great buy!,5
822273,"Bottoms are thin and cheap, not flattering, and single lined so they are super thin. TOP is great though, nice thick fabric, sturdy straps (i was really bummed to find out they were not removable straps). Fit was a little big, could definitely have ordered smaller, but since its a tie-closure I can tie it to fit well enough. Also the fringe hangs nicely and does not roll.",5
204654,"The dress fits exactly as I expected!  I am more on the petite size, and typically wear a size 6 or small/medium in most clothing.  I ordered a size medium and it fit perfectly.  Great value for the $$.  And, it was also delivered speedy quick.",5
831369,"I am surprised at how nice this looks, being that I spent $12 on it. The Mermaid portion is darker than the picture portrays, but it's still very nice. Got it for my Caribbean Cruise and I think it will be perfect. I bought a large, and I have a 27 inch waist, 34DDD, size 4-6 in US sizes. These are Asian sizes so be aware that you may need to size up.",5
84758,It's exactly what I wanted when I placed my order and it's exactly what I got. The picture is accurate and the magnets are incredibly strong. I was a little concerned at first with the magnets but when it arrived and I put it on and had trouble getting it off I knew we'd be fine.,5
873371,"Buying this watch, I wasn't sure how good it would be, as it had no reviews written. But now, as I have got my order, I am so content with my purchase. The watch is even better than the one shown on the picture. It works very well, and shines. I truly recommend",5
757490,"What I received is not what I was expecting. I purchased a product that was supposed to be a knit lace shirt with bell sleeves. The sleeves have no flare to them at all. I wanted to use this under a corset/dress for the sleeves to dress it up a bit more and I would have been further ahead to make my own.

The sizing is off, too. It makes me look like a sausage in lace.",1
24548,QUALITY MADE JACKET LIKE I REMEMERED IT THE LINER FROM ALPHA COULD BE A LITTLE THICKER BUT THEN AGAIN I WOULD CONSIDER THIS A FALL OR EARLY SPRING JACKET DELIVERY WAS SUPER FAST  ONE THING A BUTTON OR VELCRO INSERT SHOULD BE USED TO KEEP THE ARMS OF THE ALPHA LINER IN PLACE OTHER WISE A GREAT BUY,5
79972,"Even though I did order this online, it feels like someone came into my room in the middle of the night and got my measurements while I slept peacefully. Nice and snug in all the right complimentary places and enough room in the areas needed for exercise. Get these in every color. I would marry the man that created these clothes if I could!",5
788935,"I really love this ring. Its smooth on the inside and fits nicely. The domed shape of the outside gives a nice look as well. Most important of all, my wife loves it on me. A 10mm ring is quite thick however, so make sure that is the look you are after. I'm a tall guy with long fingers so it works for me.",5
572666,I purchased the medical blue dress for my girlfriend so we could have tng outfits and it looks great in her. The only problem was her bust is bigger than the xl dress allows for. If possible I'd recommend getting a size bigger just in case but other than that she's very pleased with the product,4
113521,It was beautiful and just what i expected but right when i tried to put it on the strap from one of the arms ripped off. Noce item cheap material my halloween costume broke the first time i was gonna try it on.......... guess im not gonna be a butterfly this year,3
35119,"The first thing to know about these glasses is that these are full-sized frames and not the type that you wear down on your nose and look over.  The fit and finish are okay but they are a little tight.  If you have a wide head, they may be uncomfortable.",3
690641,"I thought these were so cute and bought them as a gift for my daughter. I was disappointed when I received the earrings from this vendor,leaf heart. The dog had a flat finish as compared to the bone, and it was slightly smaller with a dot for an eye which did not appear on the picture. It did not seem to be a matching set and the dog also appeared tarnished.",1
376935,"Nice belt, nice price. The loose end keeper is not attached so I have to hunt it down everyday, but that is the only issue I have had. I carry a weapon almost everyday and the belt holds it without slipping and does not loosen up.

I have seen belts that are very similar to this belt for over $30 each, get two of these and still have money in your pocket and a nice belt on your waist.",4
327845,I wear a size 7 3/8 hat. I would have liked the Mask bigger. It is kid of tight on my head. Now some people did like smell of the Mask. That is true. It does have a strong old motor oil smell. They need to fix that. Maybe that is why the price is cheap. I washed mine with dishwater soap and that helped somewhat.,3
378191,"The person who ordered the dress didn't like it. She said it had some tail thing popping out on the back. The corset looked odd on her. She said the boob part was too big. These complaints are consistent with other reviews. But hey, maybe you get lucky with a good dress? Who knows.",1
24192,"These boxes were the perfect fit for the necklaces I'm selling. They are a lovely and professional silver  with cotton already in them to make whatever you are placing in them look their best. If you are giving gifts, or selling merchandise, I would order these boxes, because you can't beat these prices or the promptness of their delivery.",5
476328,"I've gotten so many compliments on this sweater, & I've only worn it twice now.~
The only reason this beauty is getting a 4-star review is because the finish is a bit messy; there's a few snags & frayed pieces here & there, but nothing I wasn't able to fix with a needle & patience.

DEFINITELY worth the price I paid.",4
90155,"This watch is awsome for the price, i don't wear watchs or jewlery but i love led and neon lighted stuff. The watch leds are very bright and you can even set it to light up automatically from every 5 - 30 min. The time keeping seemed to be off atad bit maybe 5 minutes not sure if it a way to adjust the speed or not but its a heavy watch looks like most of those timex type watches hey fo 14 bucks cant beat it .",5
423105,"I ordered this as a gift for  my husband.  I think this is the best of my bargains  all year.  Not only is this a perfect fit, it suits his style just fine.
We have not washed it and are not concerned with the care of this product.  After all it is a Scully.",5
262688,I would give it a 5 star rating if the padding in the bralett didn't move so easy. Other than that I love it ! Great fabric. I weigh 150lb and it makes me feel sexy ! The straps are comfy as well ! Wore it for a few hours and I forgot I had it on. :),4
57963,"My son is 5 months old and around 17 pounds, about 27-28 inches. He is wearing 6 month sized clothes, so I got 6-12 months. It fit him perfectly, but if you have a baby closer to 12 months it may be too small. It was a perfect outfit and I highly recommend it, but would advise maybe picking a size bigger.",5
10016,"I loved these as a kid and decided to give them a shot as an adult and they are just as cool as when I was a kid. Great fit to. We will see if the build quality holds up like they did when I was a kid. My guess is no, but we will see.",5
764312,This is extremely cute  and even cuter in person! It's the perfect size for carry-on and I can't wait to take it on my next trip. I use it when I have to go housesit and it fits all of my stuff and also when I go road tripping! I haven't had any issues yet! What a great product,5
50878,"After less than two weeks of using this as directed the band is constantly scrunching up in the middle and riding up. The scrunching is so bad that there are now permanent ridges in the middle of the band. I really wanted to like this and I think it was working well, but I don't know that I can continue using it when it is this uncomfortable due to the bunching.",2
129179,"I've been looking for the best skull I could find  and I'm glad this was the one I picked great size nice chain to this came faster than anything I've ever ordered from anyone ,  so if your looking for quality at a great price and  great service to this is it.",5
824575,The fit is small. I usually wear a medium and based on other reviews I bought and XXL and it fits. The colors are just like the picture and just love it.  I'm 5'2 and length is a little on the short side; wore as a beach cover up.,4
663400,"Case is too small for glasses and has damage. This is the second pair of frames I purchased from this supplier and the last. The first pair did not fit properly and looked like one of the arms was loose. They charged me 8% or $26 to return, just found that out after I received my second pair of frames from them today.",1
354207,"This is an amazingly beautiful tutu and perfect for bicycle tutu tours.  I""m a generally medium sized woman and the tutu was slightly large around the waist.  But that might have been all for the best, considering the activity.  I think it would also look good glued to a helmet.",5
866453,"It fits a little bigger for my 3 year old. I ordered 4T to make sure that it is not too small. This is a good thing to make sure that he can use it in few months. Love the fabric and I recommend it. My toddler said that he likes the ""square"" checkered style and perfect color for him. I got this at a promotional price to give review for the product.",5
598311,"Overall a very nice, well made dress. However it's 2 sizes too small. I read all the reviews before purchasing and purposely ordered a size larger than I typically wear.. Still too small. Also, my dress came a week later than the promised delivery date. This item ships from China though, so maybe that's why.",3
881631,"Love the rain boots I got for my daughter. This the second pair I get from Stephen Joseph. I bought ones years ago for my son. They are just too cute and I love all of their designs and colors.
The boots are well made and they run a little bit big. I usually buy size 10 for my daughter but I followed the size chart from Stephen Joseph nonthe one from Amazon since that one is off. I bout her 9 and still runs a little big but there is some room to grow.
I definitely recommend it!",5
489983,"I have had my bracelet now for almost a week and I am more pleased with it than when it first arrived! I appreciate the style and quality of workmanship that went into the design and manufacturing of the bracelet.  If there was any thing I would have wanted it would have been instructions on how to remove links from the band. I guess I have small wrists and it would be nice to take a couple of links out of the band. Other than that ""small""  complaint I am totally satisfied with my purchase.",5
354127,"This thing is great. I have a new puppy who loves nothing more than to chew the ponytail holders around my wrist. I thought I would give this a try and while the pup will still chew, he can't snap the bands! Also it looks way more professional at work.",5
871766,"This is a very sexy dress that fits great. The material is not too thin or see through and fits comfortably. My only complaint is that the neck does not have enough give to stretch over my head to pull it over. I heard a seam pop when I did so, but it didn't rip, which is good.",4
94009,"This is a nice little timepiece that doesn't have to be attached to your body. I have mine clipped to my purse, and it's a lot easier (and less rude) to take a glance at it instead of pulling out my phone, particularly when I'm in a meeting.

The clip is pretty solid, and the watch hasn't shown any damage after a month of hanging off of my purse.",5
137005,"There is about a 1/2 inch of extra space from the tip of my big toe to the front of the shoe. That's okay, though. I usually wear socks, so it doesn't feel too big, even if it does make your foot look a bit long.

The colors are vibrant, and the sole has plenty of grip, even on a slippery floor. I wore them for most of the day and they are comfortable.

Overall, I'm very pleased with this shoe.",5
211272,I bought this bracelet for my wife's 47th Birthday! She has been wearing everyday and it changed into a dark color on the back! When I went back to try to return it was to late for the deadline! Now my wife is  stuck with a crappy bracelet that Amazon sells to their customers! Do not buy it!,1
35472,"These reading glasses are a decent quality, but I should have paid attention that they don't have spring hinges. I didn't think it would matter, but I like to put my glasses on my head when I'm not using them and these just fall off. If you hang yours around your neck on a chain or just take them off when you're done then these might work better for you. I still use them, but they are my last choice.",3
137392,"I dislike this item because the material is too thin (shirt quality), and the large is too small for a person who wears medium. If your bust size is 36 you would need an x-large. The description should read...thin fabric blazer.  I bought it because I loved the color contrast and the design. Now I would either have to give it away or return it.",2
49670,It definitely helped suck things in after my c-section. Not sure if it made things go down faster this time (second baby) but it was definitely worth the try. It did feel nice because it felt like it kept my stomach from moving which is not always the greatest feeling the first 6 weeks after surgery. My only complaint is it does bunch up a lot so you can't wear it under your clothing inconspicuously.,4
55902,"I bought this jacket alpha nd I must to tell it is the best jacket, strong eventhought the fabric tend to make small balls on the surface of the jacket, I think this is the problem whit a mix of cotton and poliester fabric, may be Alpha should  fix this problem, but it is icnredible stron product",4
311322,"This is a really nice dress, but unfortunately I have to return it. It's just too small for me. I'm so disappointed!! It's really cute, and seems really well made. I had a feeling when I was ordering that the XL would be too small, but it looked so cute that I took a chance. If it came in a bigger size, I would be ordering it again in a minute. I gave it 4 stars because I simply liked it that much. If you can get it in a size that fits you, I would 100% recommend.",4
649948,"very strange cut to this dress.  The arm holes are small and that has NEVER happened to me before.  My dad used to call me ""chicken wings"" because my arms were so skinny.  The neck is high and the bust is in the wrong place.  I am normally a 6, but ordered an 8 -- the 10 would be more strange.  I'm going to return it.",2
808004,Way too big.  The description states that it was a small after using the sizing guide I am disappointed to say the bikini didn't fit at all.  I have purchased several bathing suits from this brand and have never had this issue.  Will be returning the bathing suit.,2
2776,"The boots fit on my foot fine, but the part around the my calf was too wide even when I tighten the boots. If you're a big woman with thick calfs then these boots will be suitable. The service was quick to send & came in new condition but the boots weren't the right ones for me.",2
691050,"I purchased this dress for a beach wedding last year, but when it arrived, it was waaaaay too short. I ordered a large, thinking it would be fine, but the front was too short. It would have worked with leggings, but I wanted a dress because the wedding ceremony was in Forth Myers, FL in July and on the beach in the middle of the day. So, basically, HOT HOT HOT! Leggings just wouldn't have worked. Maybe if I weren't 5'6, with long legs, it also may have worked. Unfortunately, I had to return it.",2
609967,I ordered a Drunk 1 & 2 shirt for my girl friend and I. We both are around a small/medium. But I ordered a small and a medium. Incase one is overly big (because of bust). And the small is a little tight in the arm pits. But the medium is little bit baggy on the shoulders. So either way they both fit to a small or medium size shirt/person. Just a little bit differences in prefrencecs I guess . Lol material is great.,5
178861,"I love this, but it runs really small. I ordered the XXL and I am a 16/18, 5'10'' tall,  and a 36DD. The bottoms are  a little tight and only come up to right above my belly button. The also like to roll down when I sit. The tom fits more like a 36C or so",3
225010,"I am a person who does NOT like to buy a new purse.  I will wear my other purse out first before I purchase a new one.  I finally saw this one and it is perfect for my needs.  It has a lot of pockets (which pleases me very much) for my cell phone, extra set of car keys, and plenty of room for my other items that I carry with me.  I especially like that it is NOT plastic.  It is a perfect purse for my needs.",5
870375,"Like so many others, it was sheer, small , though I went up two sizes it was still too small ( short , more like a midi top) and it had a really strong odor. I would have to pay the shipping back to china , which is more than what the shirt cost to begin with. Fail fail fail.",1
470953,"Putting on my Dillon NIR Sunglasses is like looking at the world for the 1st time all over again.  These are by far the best Sunglasses I have ever owned.  I like them so much that I wish I worked for Dillon, that is how much I believe in these NIR Sunglasses.  The best way to describe it is like going from regular TV to HD.  These are HD sunglasses for your daily life.",5
664752,"Sheer, BUT an undershirt does the job very well and the fabric is just thick enough for the undershirt to blend/disappear so to speak. When ordering I'd pay attention to the bust size, I chose my size based off what would fit there first and foremost and the waist still hugged my frame without any strain on the buttons over the chest.

Unfortunately I got ink on the one I bought, if I can't get it out I'll definitely be buying this again! I love it and got a lot of compliments on it.",5
388287,"One of my favorite bras, I ordered a size large and I am 5'7 165 pounds. I'm about a 38B and this bra gives me a little room to breath so it's not too tight but still supports when I workout. For the price and the quality of the bra you can't go wrong! The straps are perfect and supper cute under all of my tanks. Went back and ordered 2 more in different colors. They even came in a super cute packaging with a customer service card. So impressed!!",5
76438,A friend recommended the BellaBand and I'm grateful she did! I am 19 weeks and haven't worn any maternity clothes yet! The band works well over jeans and dress pants. True that your belly won't be completely smooth  youll see a little bump from the button of your jeans - but it isn't too noticeable and it hasn't bothered me. I was surprised that my pants stay up so well even when I have the zipper of my jeans all the way down.  Great product! Might just keep it around for Thanksgiving next year :),5
654202,"I was skeptical about buying a jumpsuit from online since I have a long torso and short legs, but it fits really well and is flattering. I am just concerned about washing it. Might not want to run it through the dryer since it's not cotton. Really love it though!",5
283036,"I feel so sexy in this outfit. It covers all your problem areas and it stays on. You will feel so beautiful and even as a plus sized woman you know everyone is checking you out.

Can't wait to buy more in other colors.

I am a size 14, size 36DD and I ordered a 5xl. It fits but I have a little extra room in the top. If I were to order again, I would get a 4xl so everything is a little more secure.",5
580331,"I'm a size 14 and I got a 5x. This was a guess, but it seems right. I can't judge yet on how warm this coat is because it's too hot here. But someone else said it was warm in the Midwest, so that's good enough for me! (And yes, I got the scarf.)",4
528848,"If you have small hips like I do, I don't suggest ordering a size up. I'm usually a Small, but listening to the reviews, I went a size up. There is just a bit of extra room in the bottoms. As for the top, it's pretty cheaply made, hence why the suit was so inexpensive. Overall, it is a good product, the style is neat.",3
398925,"These looked nice, but the fabric is very cheap and stretches out too easily. I haven't had a problem with the velcro coming undone often, but the velcro isn't sewn on very well and the strips are small enough to be a choking hazard! I tore off the velcro that was coming off before it could fall off on its own. Very dangerous.",1
136950,"I got the impression it's cushiony and comfy by reading the reviews on this product, when i tried it on it was a much firmer than my other work shoes, i'm standing all day and need enough support and comfort, this isn't the right product for that.
So i had to return it, but i would assume it would work fine for training.

It looks decent and clean. and seems sturdy.  just not the right thing for me.
I was refunded instantly upon returning so.. credit for that.",3
270053,"Like the other comments say, it looks a lot different than the picture. So it is a little misleading of what it will look like. The stripes are different, and the color is completely different from what is shown. That being said, I still love it. It is super soft and really good quality for the price. :D",4
69711,It is a cute costume but the small velcro strip that holds it around you neck. I think there should have been more to it. I had to pair it with leggins and a green undershirt. But it arrived a day before it was suppose to. It is an ideal costume for someone who whats to look sexy on Halloween.,4
677376,"I ordered 2 sizes up and the dress was still too small.  The quality of the fabric was okay for the price but not great...the biggest problem was that the dress arrived with the zipper broken.  It was halfway up the dress and stuck in the fabric.  I gently fixed it but it would not stay zipped, it kept separating near the bottom...I returned this item...",3
703749,I purchased two of these watches in different colors for my children. I'm working on teaching them to read time so these are perfect for little children. They have a very clear dial & an adjustable watchband. Another great feature is they also have a second hand on the watch which is great for timing them while they brush their teeth. Overall my children & myself are very happy with these watches.,4
591945,"I have never paid so much for a piece of jewelry that I will never be able to wear again.  I realize that I did not pay that much, however, the first time I wore it, it turned to the most horrible color I have ever seen in my life!!!!! I have even paid less for jewelry from Target that is still in very good condition.  If you are thinking of purchasing this item, I would certainly think again!!!!",1
299468,It's too large for but that isn't the main issue. It is the wrong proportions and there is way too much fabric in the front flap on the sides. I need to take it to a tailor to have it fitted properly and have the excess fabric taken. Overall it is a rather poor quality product I'm afraid.,1
584190,these are good except if they are going to fit on the thigh the tops need to be bigger. Im 27 and 93 lbs so I have pretty small legs and they are too tight on my legs let alone if i was someone larger. Everything but that is great I just really can't wear them because they pinch off circulation on my thigh's,3
34215,"I do yoga all year round, so I was excited to try these since my feet are always cold.  They didn't work for me though.  With splits like warrior or triangle pose, the sock would twist all around my foot until the grips were almost on the side instead of the bottom.  And the openings for my toes were tight and actually cut into my feet.  I took them off about halfway through my practice.  Two stars only because they're cute and the price was good, but they're not for me.",2
444091,"It's a pretty blue, but the top part doesn't have a hem at all. They don't provide a book on different ways to wear it so you'll have to go and figure them out for yourself. Also, the slender skirt does NOT look good on larger sizes. Find one with a flowing skirt instead.",2
325593,"I want to love this wallet, but the fact that the Mythosaur logo was chipped like crazy when it was delivered is annoying. It came double wrapped and in an envelope, so it wasn't from the shipping. There are a ton of pockets on it though for numerous cards and a nice large one in the middle for cash. 3 stars lost for the 3 large chips.",2
169862,"So happy with these! I actually wear them in my ears (have several piercings in each ear). I love them since they are small and don't look cluttered. My ears have always been sensitive to metals but these don't bother me at all. Also, even though there isn't a back (just a small ball), they haven't fallen out yet after weeks of wear. Exactly what I was looking for! Would definitely order them again, although with as many as are in the package, I probably won't need to for years!",5
315567,It does not stand up straight once contents are put inside.  It topples over which is very annoying.  I like the color and the fabric though. I guess it serves the function I purchased it for which was to allow me to roll my laptop and papers from one place to another rather than carry them but it would have been perfect if it didn't fall over all the time.,2
110318,"Really nice belt, great value for the price! Very comfortable, the stretchiness allows the belt to actively ""adjust"" to my every move and position. I ordered a XXL and it has a lot of extra length to it. Almost makes me think I'm an XL (well ... in my dreams, maybe!). I'm going back to order another in a different color.",5
612698,"I ordered this skirt in high hopes that it would be perfect, instead it was completely disappointing. You can't return the item because it doesn't give you a receipt or directions to return the item. Also I ordered a medium/large. When I opened and viewed the skirt it was an extra extra small, I'm not a big girl at all, I work out everyday and eat very well but I do have hips and I am curvy so unfortunately I lost money and have a skirt that I can't wear. Lose/lose situation.",1
475186,"Finally I got the coat, but the material looks cheap and feels rough. It smells bad, too. I am a little worried whether the material is safe to wear. There was news about a guy got killed by a pair of shoes he bought on line in China because of the fatal chemical on the shoes.",2
471902,"A little big on me, but with the ties it is ok. It is also a little more pale in person than in the photo. For reference, I am five feet tall/110 pounds. I bought this dress for gardening because of the big pockets. I can fit my hand tools/seeds/ etc. in them withought having to lug anything extra around.",4
771025,Bought one size smaller and fit perfectly.  I just did not anticipate that the lace would hang down and not be attached. The last two inches or so of the lace just hangs there which I find to be a bit odd. I might try to attach it somehow. Otherwise very pretty.,4
142478,"Great shirt, smooth, fits well around the shoulders. I am 6.1 (184) weight about 180pound (81.5 Kg), ordered an XL. Great fit around chest and shoulders, the shirt is super long though, completely covers my butt. Quite some fabric to put away, if you wear it over your pants it looks like you are wearing a dress. Very soft, nice fabric.",4

Mine fit perfectly and it's a very hefty, durable case, too. Very satisfied!",5

However, I bought it for the look, so I'm happy.",4
254695,This swimsuit is so adorable but be careful of the sizing. There was no drop down box to select a size so I figured it was one size fits all. The one I got said medium. I normally wear a medium so I would've gotten a L if I was given the choice.,1

604896,The first time I ordered these shoes I ordered them in the size that I wear. And they were very small I couldn't even fit my whole foot into it the shoe. But I had to have them for a wedding so I order them again and the next size up and they fit perfectly and I were them still to this day they are very comfortable and go with just about anything.,5
572840,"These pants are not true to size, I could not even get my quads in the leg. I own multiple slim fit suits and pants by CK and these are by far the worst. The quality looks and feels great but the waist is not 34, they are more like 32.",1
485914,This is so nice on looks just like the picture says xs but fits more like a medium fits perfect is very sheer but has another layer under it in the back and front the stitching is great even after washing I  cant wait to wear this also the detail is pretty,5
322335,"Doesn't quite look like the picture, but I guess I wasn't really expecting it to. It will do, but the real thing looks like all the other ones out there. I specifically tried this one due to it looking lighter in color and ""wispier"" than the others I could find, but when it arrived, it really looked just as fake as the others. Oh well, I tried. And it will still get the point across. Quick delivery, though, so that was good.",3
127563,"Not bad.  13 year old looked great.  Some issues with shoddy stitching and zipper, and it's kind of destroyed after one use.  But much better than the female stormtrooper in terms of condition upon receipt and rigidity/wearability of mask.  Good option for a young teen that doesn't want to go the sexy halloween route.  Decent attempt at realism-- the costume reads fierce, rather than girly.",4
170876,Way too small... I was under the impression from viewers that it fits with ur size and that it was even loose but I found the cheapest one that look the same and come to find out that the different sellers size them differently. It is actually good quality but only buy a large if your a medium or small.,3
575843,"I loved the idea of an affordable hunting blazer but this one came out totally wrong.

 In all fairness the wool fabric they used is ok. It is similar to their wool shirts that I own. The arm patches are very low quality. They are made from a low quality synthetic material that has no weight to it.

 The sizing is so off it is insane. After all do blazers come in a XXL ?

Don't waste your time. Great Idea that needs to be seriously re thought before it is produced.

If I could I""d definitely order again this time the right size ..",4

My daughter is very petite and thin, and they have worked so well for us. It's hard finding baby clothes that she doesn't drown in. I loved the slim fit! I also love the simple designs.",5
93834,"For those of you out there who are weary about ordering things like gloves, jackets, ect... online. I can say this, These gloves fit to size your used to. Ive bought gloves from stores in XL and they fit for the most part. These gloves fit better than the ""ok"" brand in the stores. Although they look cumbersome, they have excellent mobility and fitting.",5

224971,"I've been using this as my purse for a couple months now and it works great. I can fit my ipad, my wallet and so much more. The zipped small side pouch holds my iphone; the unzippled side pocket is perfect for a regular bottle of water. There three outside zipped pockets and one inside. The shoulder strap tends to lengthen easily so I often have to readjust the length. Overall, an excellent bag.",5
62094,After reading the reviews I opted for the smaller size as I was on the border between sizes (purchased the small) I expected the fit to be more snug and compress my post-baby belly more. I am 10 weeks post delivery so maybe it would have felt better more imediately after delivery. I was hoping these would smooth out my belly under clothing but they didn't and the waist band rolls down frequently. I will hang on to them for baby #2 and try them earlier than 10 weeks.,3

I have had both luck and some pleasure from this supplier's  designs and construction
Cheap, attractive and, if you choose, disposable.
This one was only disposable  but no one held a gun to my head when I was ordering it.",1

If I remember to I will update in another month or two on the wear and tear versus a traditional belt.",5
349790,"I bought this to decide if I could deal with the realities of a nose piercing, but didn't get to really give it a try because it was oversized to the point that it kept falling off. :( it was aesthetically pleasing, so if you have longer nostrils or a larger nose I say go for it.",2
588680,I bought this bra in a pinch while looking for something to wear with a backless dress for a wedding I was in. I ended up wearing something else because the sticky tabs showed thru the dress. The bra seemed nice and would have worked great with a different outfit.,4
290427,I normally wear a 8 so I ordered a medium and it was kind of big! Even the top (and I wear a 36 DD) Id suggest going down a size if you don't have much of a stomach. I ordered the blue and yellow and both colors were very vibrant! Good buy!,4
245135,"I love these socks! They are so cute and very versatile. I wouldn't hesitate to wear them with either casual or dress pants. They're thinner than most crew socks and the colorful patterning makes them very attractive. They fit snugly (which I love!) but I've been assured they won't shrink and can be stretched to size after washing and machine drying. I haven't washed them yet, but Vero Monte has amazing customer service so I'm not worried. I'm so glad I found this sock company!",5
539277,"I needed this to wear with a dress that came down low in the back. It did the job and was pretty comfortable. Only thing I don't like is that it loses its stickiness too quick. But hey, it was only $4 bucks. Overall I was pretty okay about the product.",3
116070,"This necklace is so beautiful and the gem looks exactly like the one in the picture. It hangs on a chain instead of a rope, but it fits around my slightly small neck perfectly and hangs down about two inches below my collarbone. I am so glad I bought this, my boyfriend and other friends who are fans of SAO have been SO jealous!",5
143648,The mask was great other than the fact that it's eye holes were too low and the mask was very big for the average head size. I got the latex smell out by throwing it in the washing machine for a cycle. I wore it around Target and it got lots of attention!,4
223322,"I was impressed with the speed of shipping and handling it actually came two days before the estimated date and not to mention it was very well wrapped it came wrapped in this order: plastic envelope, receipt, bubble wrap, and finally its original store packaging. The size is a medium size buckle looks like its very well constructed and the lighter factor keeps your friends wanting one every time you pull it out of the buckle",5
841619,"Bought the same size. But obviously the blue pair are not a Large. The blue pair I just got today are a small with a Large size tag sewn into the pants. I couldn't even get one leg in and I'm a seamstress to all my cloths, because I'm short and have to alter all my cloths. This is way off in measurements to the tag size.",1
817114,"My daughter was thrilled with this outfit and so excited to wear it! She has worn it once and not even for a full day. The top fit great but I'm very disappointed in the quality of the leggings. They were loose, the knees became worn after only one use and the pants faded already after I washed them. For the price I expected better quality. I can buy leggings for a lot less that are better made.",3
405280,"I purchased this shirt for my son, and he was disappointed that the shirt we received was different from the one pictured on the website. Below the NFL logo are the words ""New Orleans Saints"" printed in black letter, and immediately underneath, it says ""Equipment"" in white letters. The fleur-de-lis logo is printed beneath this in gold. While we eventually decided to keep the shirt, we ended up having to exchange it for one a size smaller than my son normally wears, as the sizes run large.",3

I can't believe I was duped in buying this purse.  I bought my mom one like it 9 months later and her's is already falling apart.  Don't buy this, you'll be sorry!!!!",1
261863,"This is perfect for my 3 year old grand daughter.  Just note that if it breaks, all the pieces will be loose and easily ""eaten"" by little babies.  She has a 9 month old brother crawling around, so these are kept away and only used to go out.  Not at home.  They are adorable.  The colors are cute.",5
282086,"It's a pretty shirt but the size is very misleading.  When it arrived, it smelled horrible.  I usually wash everything before I wear it but this went straight into the laundry room.  I did not realize this ships from China which is why it took so long to get here.",2
820752,I first received this and it had a rip on the shoulder in the lace :( I had to sew it back together myself which was annoying. But it fit well on my Preggo belly and looked awesome in my maternity photos. I just contacted the seller and they refunded me about $3 for the rip. I usually wear a medium but since I'm pregnant I ordered an XL and it fit well. Very see through though so I had to order a slip to wear underneath it. Not bad for the price :),3

A few loose threads, but nothing that couldn't easily be taken care of) Surprisingly, not see through (as I ordered the white). I would buy another.",5
51250,"I am post baby two weeks.  This is nice as it helps you feel slimmer, but with as much sitting i do with baby to nurse,it can be uncomfortable, as it slides up and gets right underbustline.  Everytime I bend over it slides too.  Otherwise I have dropped 6 inches around and know that the discomfort is worth it in the longrun",4
184668,Love love love this purse.  It's got lots of extra hidden pockets inside and out.  3 on the outside and 4 inside plus the two big section in the purse for everything you need.  I love how big it is yet not gigantic.  As a mom kids always shove stuff in there also lol.,5
66551,"I love these tongue rings! Each ball design is pretty neat. I did get a few duplicates but I don't care too much. The only thing that I didn't like were the pot leaf looking balls. I really only needed to buy the balls because I have a custom bar, due to the fact that normal bars are too long for my tongue and make it hard to talk. I wish they only sold balls. The shipping was super fast! I got it 2 days before I was supposed to. I will be buying from this seller again!",5
742038,I like this very much. It's loose and airy. Very lightweight and sheer fabric meant to be worn with a cami underneath. It has a high-low hem and is baggy/slouchy fitting. I did get an XL when I always wear a US medium and it fits just like the picture.,5
837721,"Horrible. It is nothing like the picture and has weird sheer parts, not for the workplace. It was cheap and I think if I kept it on for another minute it would unravel. Waaaaay too small a would recommend a size 0 to go to the largest size and everyone else don't get it. The size 0 people also should not get it because it is too cheap in quality.",2
652500,"I used the size chart but way too small. Out of the package it looked like it had been worn. Had no problems with return, seller gave me 1/2 my money back and told me to keep the dress. I'll donate it prom season is coming up. I ordered the largest size, my bust is 36C, waist is 33, and hips 42. The bust squeezed my breast down, really unflattering.",2
845242,"When I ordered, I was worried the size would be too small based on other reviews. I fit in both small and medium US sizes, so I decided on an Asian XXL (US Small Plus). Fortunately, it fit nearly perfectly; much much better than an American brand. I said ""nearly"" because the shoulders are slightly narrow compared to a normal fit, but it wasn't anything that would bother me. This is truly a slim fit shirt.

As for the material, it feels comfortable and durable, though time will tell for the durability. Color is nice.",5
469101,I purchased this rolling laptop backpack to give to my daughter and son-in-law as a gift.  They were very excited about receiving it since they do quite a bit of traveling and take their laptop with them.  It met their needs and it arrived just in time for Christmas.,5
198215,"I got this bikini a few days ago in the mail, and I love it! It is just like triangl without the price. There is no padding in the top, which is somewhat disappointing, but I'm going to sew some in myself to fix that. I received the wrong size top, and I emailed ebuddy about it. They have the quickest customer service out of many of the companies I've ever ordered from! This suit is DEFINITELY worth the $20 I spent!",5
264183,"This just arrived yesterday, and I'm wearing it today. I love it! I think I'm going to buy more, in other colors. I ordered a medium, and it fits perfectly -- I'm 5'5"", 130 lbs, relatively fit. The fabric is a good quality knit, though it's a tad thin -- so I'm glad I bought a darker color. It's a really flattering fit and looks great with a casual t-shirt or dressed up for work. The only disappointment is that it clings a bit to leggings, so it's probably best worn over bare legs.",5
55073,"I bought this ring for my husband when we got married in 2011. About 6 months ago he showed me where it had a slight crack appearing in the middle part of the ring - now it has turned to a very LARGE crack that I feel will break the ring in half soon. I have emailed Metal Masters about this issue, but never received a response. It is a great price for the ring, and he did love it - but I do not want to have to purchase a new wedding band every year and a half.",1
567128,I sent these to my friend who lives out-of-state now for Christmas; she is petite & LOVES penguins. She called me & was SO happy with this all-in-onezie! She said the length was perfect & they are SO warm & cozy! She said they made her Christmas for her! SO happy with this purchase!!,5
464443,"This jumpsuit is beautiful. The pattern is great, very intricate. However, the fabric is super thin. The button holding the Halter top together at the neck came off within a few wears. Cheap construction I guess.  I could take the time to mend it, but don't think I should have to for the price.",2
612025,This is a very sexy bathing suit. i plan to wear it to a beach party so it fits the bill. I have big breast to there is a whole lot of side boob. This bathing suit is not for the conservative type obviously so don't buy if you don;t want a lot of attention. i love it,5
119636,"Love this swim diaper except that it is very snug on my 9 month old. She wears 9 month clothes so I thought buying 6-12 month size would be sufficient but her poor legs get so red and indented after wearing this for only 30 minutes. But otherwise, it is cute, thick material, made well, snaps that actually work.",4
672834,Not at all as pictured. I have never given anything a bad review and honestly it would be perfect for a small B or A cup but for me I'm 36C and this didn't work for me at all not enough coverage I won't be able to wear it at all,1
105248,"Initially when reading the reviews, I was a bit hesitant to purchase this shirt, but since I really liked the style, I decided on a whim to purchase the shirt anyways, and I am happy I did. The shirt can definitely be dressed up or down, but for me, this will be a shirt that I will be dressing up. The fit is perfect, definitely a keeper. The shipping did take a while, but never the less, I am pleased with my purchase.",5
15038,"I have plantar fascitis and I have tried so many different inserts and shoes it makes my head spin - these are by far the best for the money - they do the job and do it well.  My podiatrist recommended them - these can fit in almost any shoe that has enough depth and they really, really, help your foot.",5
15496,"I'm a cook, so I regularly am on my feet for 8 hours at a time. These things are fantastic. I had Dr. Scholls, which are pretty comfortable, but as far as support goes, these are much better. For an everyday pair of shoes, the Dr. Scholls actually feel better, but for marathon sessions at work, the hard and firm powersteps are great for keeping me from being in pain. I would highly recommend them.",5
39095,These are what I was looking for and they are great except they are really large!  I would buy them again but in a much smaller size.  I had bought these extra large to give room for exercising.  My fault but will make sure I go down a couple of sizes when I buy them again.,5
282134,"Very cute shirt, but very small through the arms. The lace is very cute, and the fit through the middle is great, but my arms wouldn't fit through the sleeves. My mom is about my size, but has much smaller arms and this shirt fits her arms a little tight, but it works. She loves it! Just not for us large-armed girls",4
802927,"When purchasing it says it runs small. look at the chart. I'm 5'8 and I'm 120 lbs. I thought I should get a medium since it says it runs very small. I received the medium, only to try it on and it was too big. want to exchange it but small isn't prime eligible.",2
770041,I'm 5'3 and about 108 pounds and normally a small so I went ahead and got a small. It fit perfect and is pretty good quality for the price. I'm only a B 34 so the top fit fine but if you have a bigger chest I wouldn't recommend this because the top runs very tight and small. Couldn't have been more pleased with this outfit for the price!,5
627020,"I took my chances ordering this because there were no reviews...received it in 2 weeks I must say it was super cute! Got lots of complements. True to size. I am 105 lbs got a small. It was perfect! (Gray set)

Lately, money being short I decided to try a bargain pair of shoes and take a chance on these insoles.  At first it felt like a huge rock in my shoe and I thought I made a huge mistake.  Remarkably, after a few days, all the pain went away and I can work all day without any foot pain.",5

541983,I love that I have these 12 pairs of colorful and well made knit gloves! They can fit most anyone and they make great gifts! I am thrilled with the quality and style too! They are easy to store and fold together to place in a drawer! I got thiese for a discount and a honest review!! Awesome gloves,5
368046,"I was nervous about buying this just because I was worried it would fit, I read the other reviews and most recommend to go up a size so I bought the small and I love it!! It's so cute and it has a Velcro strap to adjust how tight it is. It is a bit small so I make sure I wear spandex under it and I have to make sure I don't bend over to much or the bottom of my butt will show! Over all I love it and it was well worth it!",5
159376,"cute and evil and sarcastic, Love it..it is so cute. However, I am a very skinny person and yet this shirt bulges out in the front. it must be because of the print material being thick it does not lay nicely on the body. i always have to pull it flat because it poofs out. It makes even me look like I have a belly or am pregnant, which is disappointing since the design is so cute. so  just beware of that.",5
103387,"I'm very happy with my purchase! I'm 5'3"", 100lbs and 32A, so a Small fits. The blouse is somewhat sheer (I wear a camisole underneath) and kind of boxy but I think that is the style so no complaints. The fit is great and the fabric is nice. The quality is good, so for the price I paid I am extremely satisfied. Its a very cute office piece and I love wearing it work!",5
120399,My son is 1 1/2 years old and he's 25 lbs. He has a small waist and can still fit in. 9-12 mo pants or shorts because he's a little skinny. It says that the max weight is 25 but the 18 month fit perfect. I tried the ones with lots of buttons for adjusting but it was too much. Two buttons on one side is enough. I will be getting more colors. Love it!,5
362915,I got these as a gift and I find myself putting them on all the time. Especially if I'm going to be travelling through TSA that day. Might as well have something unique to show for having to take my shoes off in public. These are comfy and have held up well.,5
519203,"I was not disappointed for the price I paid.
With that said in the future I will pay the premium price and buy the Oakley lenses.  I have tried just about every brand of Oakley Flak Jacket 3rd party lenses and although most of them are fair they do not compare to the Oakley lenses.  I will say that these look good and fit perfect.",3
782778,"The fabric is lightweight, which I didn't anticipate. It is pilling after only the initial wash, hasn't been worn yet. The sizing is off, to the point that I wonder if the wrong tag was sewn in. I ordered an 18m and it is much larger than any 24m we have. Not a bad item, just not worth the $29.99 we paid for it.",3

Looking to buy my glasses again, I have recently lost my Coach Julayne frames (HC6013 5001 in black) and I reaaallly loved that pair!
I was just curious if they were the same exact frame? They look the same to me! And if so, I would definitely be interested in this purchase.
If not, I'll just play it safe and get my Julayne frames again.",4
341669,"They fit me fine and were comfortable when tried on. However, they are very shiny and became transparent when I would do anything other than stand around. More like tights than leggings. I would recommend these for layering, but definitely not to be worn as leggings alone with your bum exposed.",2

I'm very impressed, and highly recommend it.

Note that you cannot wear it with leggings, it only works on bare skin.
Sizing: I wear a size 10 pant and have a little larger thighs than usual, and the medium was comfortably snug. The large was too large.",5
168015,"Comfiest clothing I have ever worn.  The material is smooth and soft, fits to my waist, hips and legs perfectly in XL without pinching, scrunching or prickling.

Then, not 1 but 2 replacements were also dead on arrival. My wife's birthday present ended up being a month late after all was said and done. After the third and final attempt I just went to the manufacturer directly.",1

133636,"Arrived on time. I probably should have gone with a 7.5 instead of an 8 because they do seem a little big, but if I wear thick socks they are fine. Also, they can sometimes make a very annoying squeaky noise when I run on certain surfaces so I'm trying to get them worn in. Over-all, I am satisfied with my purchase!",4
107364,It did not come with any protective covering on the face or most of the band. As a result it arrived scratched on the face and a little bit on the band too and I had to return it. It looked like it worked fine but I expected to get a new watch and I do not think I received that.,2
430221,I would give this pin a 5 star except more attention needs to be given to sharpening the tip.  There is a burr which hangs on the material as you pin it.  It will tear and hang on threads as it is inserted.  I would send it back if not for the hassle and reorder.,4
4018,It was fine.  I am short so it was really long on me.  I ordered it big since the reviews said order up.  I did and it was good idea.  I would say that the model must be super tall because I didn't expect the dress to be almost mid-knee.,4
723262,"Looks just like the picture! And fits according to the size chart. The colors are beautiful!  I would love this skirt if it were 6"" longer. I'm 5'8"", and love ankle length skirts. This skirt is classic calf length, which is  nice, but not as nice for me as ankle length.",4

722118,"This is a great umbrella! I love how big it is and how quickly it pops open with a button.
It's easy to use, it's sturdy and made from great quality material. It is way better than our little umbrella that could barely fit one of us under it. This one fits the three of us.

82137,"The design I have chosen is very artistic. The swirls reminded me of Japanese motif design. I wasn't even planning to buy a new pouch but I did cuz I couldn't resist the design.
It has a good quality zipper and nice fabric feel. The size is bigger than what I expected, but that's a plus for me who carries lots of pens and highlighters around. It manages to fit a bunch of stuff without looking bulky.",5
559673,"The material is very soft and light. Follow the sizing instructions and you should be fine. The ""O"" is the hole in witch your man parts come through and rest in the pouch like flap. For me the pouch is a little small. It's a great price for the very good quality. You might want to look at the David Archy",5
532263,This product is poorly constructed and all I can use it for is to wipe my floor. The top is waaaaaaayyyy to big and the dress itself has loose threads with the op part barely hanging on to the base skirt. It was a total waste of my money. The side slits don't stay down and its got a pucker on both sides. Nothing like the way it fits in the photo.,1
142879,"If you're buying the ""fire entire red"" scarf please note: IT IS NOT RED, ESPECIALLY A CLASSIC RED. It is more of a maroon almost dark pink color. I specifically got this to wear to my school's football games, and the color was so off... I had to return it.",2
131070,"Usually when I buy things from Allegra K, they come in a small and they fit. I thought that I should buy a medium but it turned out to be somewhat bigger than I expected and I wish I had bought a smaller size but that is my fault. I love the dress though. It looks exactly as the picture and the quality is excellent. :)",5
524037,After reading the reviews I decided to order a size large. I am 5'4 13 lbs and it fit almost perfectly. My only complaint would be the bra padding kind of sits on top of the boobs. Luckily I'm only a C cup and my boobs stand up straight on their own bc this suit offers no support. Great material and it looked exactly like the picture!  I can't wait to wear this out!,4
834066,"While this is a very cute dress, it is EXTREMELY short.  We had a theme day at work and this dress worked perfectly. I'm just super self-conscious about everything and found the dress to be super short, especially for work. However, that aside, the fabric was extremely comfortable, light-weight and just all out good. The only reason that I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 was length, only because I was not aware. Either way, it's perfect for a night out!",4
654010,"I love Amazon!

I received this dress about 10-11days after ordering it....I'm satisfied! It fits as expected..nice, stretchy, the dress is as the picture shows

If you are on the chunky side, simply wear a body shaper and you will be OK.

The dress is thin, but perfect for the summer

I love this dress..purchase it, you won't be sorry",5
875393,I've ordered 4 of the same dress because I loved the fit and quality soo much!  It was weird when 2 of them fit great and the other 2 fit differently.  Doesn't make sense?  Returning the 2 that had a strange fit and purchasing again hoping to get the better fit.  I'll update after they are received.  Also I'm 5'8 150lbs and the medium was perfect!,5
689836,"For the price these are great.  The material is very soft and thin making it feel like you are not wearing anything at all.  Everything is covered but to a minimum which is great for me.  They have a similar feel to women's panties, but fit and feel much better.  I would buy this product again.",5
92642,"this is disgusting.  You need to remove it immediately.  This country is working so hard to stop animal abuse and this product just promotes it.  I will not buy anything from Amazon until this product is removed from your website.  How can you be so insensitive to the plight of living, breathing animals by promoting this?  this is just horrible.",1
403538,"The jacket is a Christmas present for my husband which I let him open early as it got cold here on the Texas coast and we're having freezing drizzle...unheard of! Back to the jacket, he's always been a leather fringe jacket guy and it was at the top of his list. This one was at a reasonable price and yet is of good quality. It fits him to a 'T' so the XL size is true. Thanks so much for offering this item on Amazon.",4
447445,"The dress reaches past the knee (5'11), and fits absolutely perfect.  It's snug, but not tight and the material is very soft and thin enough that you can wear it on its own, or pair it with something without being too hot or cold.  The only complaint might be that it's a little see-though at my chest (larger chest size to blame, not the dress) which is easily fixed with a ""nude"" bra.  I totally recommend this dress; I've worn it once and was complimented.",5
603944,As much as I love the design on the shirt it was really really short and I paid expedited mail and it was 3 days  late so I didn't even get to wear in on St. Pattys day so I was not happy about that. The width was fine just really short.,1
462628,This is an Asian product and the sizing is nothing like American sizing.  It tells you its Asian size (way down at on the bottom line of the description) but it is an American size chart.  I would never have ordered if I had known it was Asian made.  I ordered an XL and I usually order L.  I could not even get my arms in it.,1
572882,"Great way to quickly find your bag after a flight in a sea of black bags.

I did get a crack in the case after 3 flights, that is why it lost 2 stars.
The warranty that came with it is why it didn't lose more stars, they were willing to give me a replacement since it was still within warranty.",3
858845,"BEWARE when buying this product.  The print looks about as pictured, but the material is nothing like a cotton blend.  It feels like a swishy tent material.  Additionally, the fabric is white (cheap looking) on the inside, so if you fold the sleeves, it is noticeable.  If fabric doesn't matter to you, this will probably be fine.  Size up according to instructions.",2
77278,"After washing these underpants only a few times, they are literally falling apart. The small elastics in the fabric that make it stretchy all have started to pull out, so it looks like the underwear is furry or covered in white hair. I know it's cheap, but don't buy this underwear!",1
810891,Loved the backpacks but the largest backpack I had trouble with the straps. I would adjust them to the size I wanted and they would go straight to being the biggest the straps can go. I used this backpack to travel so that was kind of a pain in the butt having to walk through the airport constantly adjusting the straps. I probably won't use it again if I can't figure out how to make them stay smaller...,3
123670,"Great shoes for the price. I ordered a 44 after reading reviews and viewing a sizing chart, they were still a little big but not enough to make me return them. The clips wiggle a little but that is expected with these types of clips/pedals. If you don't like the shoe to have a little movement on the pedal I recommend getting a different style of clip.

All in all, happy with the purchase and functionality of the shoes/clips/pedals.",4

44939,"This is high quality wool. It is gorgeous! AND I know it will also repel odors and bacteria. It fits comfortably on our baby and he even kept it on during windy, cold, damp weather. It is long enough in the neck to really cover the typical gap at the neck, and the face opening wasn't too big (so it wouldn't let cold air in). We love this product!!!",5
34874,"I have read several reviews on these glasses.  I want to be clear- I bought six pair of reading glasses for $12.  I am not expecting custom quality.

The glasses look ok and are as durable as glasses I pay $12 a pair for at the grocery store.  They are light weight and do the job.  If they become damaged or lost, I do not miss them. I keep them stashed in my car, coat, desk, at work and so on.  I would recommend them (for what they are) and would buy them again.",4
150635,"Seem like good socks, but run small.  I ordered the M/L size which the size guide shows as being for up to men's size 12 shoe size.  I wear an 11 but these were a little too small and worked down below my ankle within a few dozen steps.  They seem like good socks, though, about the same as the Injinji's I have.  I'm returning them, but l'll probably try them again in the XL size when/if they get back in stock.",4
768920,The dress is beautiful. However they made the top part so that the cup of the breast is way too high which Cuts underneath the arm. If you went with the bigger size and the dress would be way too big. The cup that comes within the dress is literally up right below your collarbone. Either I'll have to pay to have it altered or return it.,1
34914,"I lose my glasses ALL the time. My solution is simple. Overpower my ineptitude with numbers. Buy a box of perfectly adequate reading glasses, leave them all over the house, and eventually I'll find a pair.  When I lose all of those, $20 and change, and another 6 pair show up, some of the older ones reappear and in another couple of years I'll never have to search for reading glasses!  Problem solved.",5
654176,This is a gorgeous dress.  Fabulous material. Not cheaply made.  An excellent value.  I received so many compliments.  But the dress is very long!!!  I am 5'7'' and wore 5 inch heels and the dress touched the floor like in the photo.  Impossible to walk in without holding the dress up with your hands.,5
419999,"I must say you are getting a very good price and these are very comfortable. You also do not notice anything ""irregular"".

However, I ordered these to use as boxers -- that is to wear them around the house. Not a good plan. These are very thin, plus the fly is very narrow. All in all, not very useful for my intended purpose.",2
334287,The belt quality is very nice and as expected. The length of the belt is too long. 48 inchhes. Screwed it up trying to cut it to 34 inch waist.  My fault. But they should offer proper lengths. However I knew the belt was 48 inches. It was on the web page.,3
296961,Runs rediculous small!! I purposely order a size bigger after reading all the reviews that the bathing suit runs small and the size up was still way too tiny! Now I have no choice but to return this. I saw it came from China so their sizing chart is probably way off for America's standards!  :/,1
612288,"these worked well with my outfit and were okay for a photoshoot. but when i wore these to a con, they were constantly falling down and i had to safety pin them to my gun holsters. if it weren't for the holsters, they would've fallen all the way down. if you choose to buy these, make sure you have something tht will hold them up.",3
663356,"I like this top, especially for the price. I will probably pair it with a high-waisted skirt on the weekends or going out at night. It will take you a minute to figure out how to feed the strings in to the loops, but it's really not too complicated. Fair warning, if you have a large bust, this shirt doesn't provide any real support. You can tighten the strings and that will help some, but I wouldn't wear this top unless you have a small-ish bust.",4
726907,Coat itself was very nice actually took my wifes measurements when ordering and by the size chart it should have fit I guess their inches are smaller than the ones I used. I would recommend them just make sure you order larger than you think you should. Other than size difference I give them five stars. Didn't bother returning this one sent it to our teenage granddaughter and it fits her perfectly.,3
130678,"When something is titled ""jacket"" I expect an item that will ward off the cold. This is a single layer of light fabric that cannot even be called a windbreaker. The stitches were unfinished with threads hanging loose. The skull looks better in the picture than in person. It's just white thread woven into a pattern over mesh and (as stated earlier) the thin fabric.",1
67656,"I love this ring.  I originally looked at this ring for my little sister's birthday, but loved it so much that I decided to keep it!  I know, shame on me.  I did feel really bad when she saw it and loved it.  Now I know what to get her for Christmas.  Thanks!!",4
218432,"Overall this is a very cute costume. I am a size 4, 36C and the shirt was way to tight for me (I ordered a medium). I still feel like I got a great deal though. The skirt is very cute and great quality for the price. The matching hair bows will be perfect for my Brittney Spears costume.",4
515826,"Loved this. It was a bit time consuming waiting for it to come (maybe 2-3 weeks... I'm impatient.) but it is just a great perchase, you get more than what you pay for, it sticks like it's supposed to, I actually put mine through the washer and it was actually still wearable afterwards!",5
17629,I love this ring. I bought not fully sure what I would get by other reviews. The sizing was dead on. The stones sparkle great and catch the light just perfectly. One ring is slightly larger than the others but I put the larger one in the middle and actually like that look better than I would if they were all the same. I would recommend this ring to anyone!,5
106508,"This is super cute, however the only thing I don't like are that the sleeves have a transparent mesh thing along the top. It makes it look a little too casual to wear at work.  The material is also very stretchy, almost like this should be used as a work out top, not a blouse.",3
744345,"So...I love the print of the suit....however..I ordered a medium because the reviews said to order up ( I am usually a small). The top is too big and the bottoms are a tad snug. For the price I am not going to return it, I am going to see if I can alter the top and just buy different bottoms",3
119317,"2 of the pearls were unglued upon opening, however, superglue was a quick and easy fix.  The headband is extremely uncomfortable but no more so than an average uncomfortable headband.  I ordered it for appearance rather than for practicality anyway and it was at an awesome price.  If this is what you're looking for it's an economical and satisfactory choice.",4
15012,"I have a pair of wide tennis shoes and these are like walking on air.  I love them in the wide shoes.  They fit, but do not give my toes enough room in the medium width shoes.  I leave them in the wide ones and love wearing them best.",5
830598,"Too small, and not worth the expense of returning.  I bought this for my Mom, who was looking for a shoulder bag that had a firmer build to it - where the sides would collapse or look sloppy.

This bad fit those needs, but ... if you drop your wallet into the purse, and reach in to take it out - the bag's opening is so small/narrow that you can't get your wallet out in your hand.",2
908,"These shirts are longer than any other size medium shirts I've ever bought (the sleeves stuck out of my short sleeve shirt sleeves and I do not wear super fitted shirts).  Also, when they came, they were pink.  I looked at them in a lot of different lights, had other people look at them, compared to other shades of white.  It was weird. It went away after the first wash though and now they are a nice brilliant white.",3
851709,We have one dog and three foster dogs.  The fosters come and go and none responded to this.  It did not help.  I've had these type devises before and they worked.  I ordered the one that worked from Drs Foster and Smith.  Will order theirs again.,1
268253,"I have bought other Belfen bags but this is my favorite. Soft leather, beautiful color. The slots are big enough for the credit cards in this bag - in a smaller bag, they barely fit. It's easy to open and find things. I am going to order this in another color - probably the red, which also looks rich. Great value for the price.",5
830040,I'm very large in the chest and only a little belly n this suit was perfect. It held in in all the right spots around the stomach and butt and it also had enough material to cover my large breasts and still made it look sexy not trashy. I would definitely buy again or recommend. However I'm typically a 16 to 18 and in this suit I had to buy 12 to 14 it runs a bit large.,5
323017,I love this ring. I bought it for my tragus piercing. I love it so much that I'm ordering a second ring to take with me when I get the other side pierced. I love it. It fits perfectly and it hangs nicely. The ball is pretty. I couldn't be happier. It's exactly what I wanted.,5
416263,"I read some reviews that said the black backing comes apart or something but this didn't even come with the backing and you can tell it was pulled off so now it just looks weird. I bought it as a gift, I hope they like it this way.. just not what I was expecting, that's all.",3
399791,"I was looking for a bag that I could carry my necessary flight gear along with my 15' Mac laptop.  This bag fits my needs perfectly.

873307,"These sweaters are amazing. They are great quality, soft, and don't fade after washing - I love the ones I have ordered in other colors.

That being said - I have ordered the Mustard-colored sweater TWICE - both times I asked for an XL, and both times I was sent a size Small. So I guess ordering sizes is a lottery - you never know what they will actually send. If you get lucky and you actually receive the correct size, you win!",2
98163,"My daughter is having trouble with veins on her legs this pregnancy. I bought these in an attempt to help. they are light weight compression hose, but serious compression hose. That means they are tough to get on and no fun during the hot summer months. But they do cut her leg pain, decrease the vein bulging and make life easier. Although she is a solid medium in everything, the medium hose were just too small, too tight, and just did not stay up. The large was a much better fit on her medium sized body.",5
198074,"This product is not as pictures. The bikini bottoms reminds me of shinny aluminum. It doesn't have that fade (white and grey) look that's portrayed in the photo. The top is okay, a little bit but it is manageable after adjusting the scraps.!  The bottoms are completely horrible.  I advise ANYONE to rethink this particular swimsuit, I cant speak for the other colors.",2
468326,"It's ""okay"". The material is very fake feeling; not like a soft, cottony hoodie. The fur does NOT come all the way around inside the hood and in front, like in the picture. It's only inside the top 2/3 of the hood. I'm probably going to return it. It wasn't cheap and the quality just doesn't measure up to the price.",2
441185,"This luggage was put to the test with a 14 day trip to London and a cruise to Norway.  I was worried it wouldn't hold up but it did and has made several airline trips since.  The only negatives to me are the handle is ""loose"" and won't stay up and the wheels should be the 360 degree kind--it's a little difficult to pull or push the luggage through airports.  But it is very lightweight and therefore more stuff can be packed in it.",4
13097,"So far, after one day - a failure.  Walked around Cosxco and a grocery store and feet were killing me.  A little too wide for my shoes with the insole out.  Looks like a possible good product.  Disappointed in my experience.  Will possibly give it another chance, but my Vionic shoes and Altra's feel great so far so if they fail, I won't be so hard on this product.  Fit perfect in my size 13 shoe.",1
247332,When I received this necklace I was disappointed. It looked like someone buried it in the dirt for a very long time  but I really just wanted the charm anyway. I would have been happy with it  but the charm loop broke only after a couple of weeks. So now I'm off to the jeweler with hopes that it can be fixed or if they can make another charm exactly like this one in real Sterling Silver or Gold. So please don't waste your money on this piece. I'm so sad this is my first one star review.,1
376140,"Doesn't fit or look like anything in the picture. It's cut very short and fits funny on top. I got a large because I'm 5'5"" and 36ddd but it was too big around the stomach but too short. Not shiny like the picture but more like a matte look if that makes sense and the words are iron on.",2
786635,"I ordered 3 of these for my daughters, and they are very pretty.  The one for my oldest girl is a bit small.  Seems to be the same size as the one a size smaller, but it will work.  Nice for wearing over sleeveless Easter dresses when the weather is still a little chilly.",4

The purchaser was convinced that the item was silver plated not .925 sterling and warned not to purchase anything from Peora. So far...that doesn't seem to apply to the two pieces I've purchased, both of which I cleaned with jewelry cleaner before wearing. Also, these earrings are much prettier in person.",5
547833,"It took 18 days from the time I placed the order before I received them. I had to contact Amazon to track the package for me, it was not mailed from the vendor for 12 days after the order was placed. Much too long. The earirings are not what they look like in the picture. They are very small, the amethyst is extremely small, can barely see them and you cannot tell that they are green, they look like clear glass. Overall, I'm very dissappointed in this product.",1
28523,"Not sure if these are helping my heel pain or not, as I have not noticed any real difference at this point.  I have been using these inserts for about a week now.  What I can say is that they make the majority of my shoes too tight to wear and I end up removing them and replacing with the shoe's original insole.  I have not given up completely on these inserts, but I am a little less than impressed with them.",3
15010,I have used these for about four years in my running and hiking shoes and prefer them to custom orthotics. They are far more comfortable and provide just the right amount of support. These greatly reduce my metatarsal pain. They are durable - I have had pairs of these last for two years.,5
107471,"When I first put them on, they felt a little tight and the arches felt a little high.  After wearing them on the badminton court, they performed beautifully!  My feet didn't feel cramped and the grip of the soles was fantastic...a measurable difference.  The style of the shoes is a little dated, but since they're just for badminton, I don't really care.",5
137901,"I was looking for a visor to go under my equestrian helmet.  The helmet is closely fitted to my head with foam inserts.  The thin straps worked great, I couldn't feel them under my helmet and they didn't affect the fit at all.  What a great product.  I was hesitant to spend the money on a ""foam"" visor.  I was surprised to see that it is actually fabric covered foam and appears to be very well made.

It is truely light weight and just big enough to extend the built in visor.

It met my requirements exactly.",5
539886,"These are outstanding, just used them this fall hiking around in Rocky Mountain national Park. They are real open in the front and, it is like a mesh fabric, so I don't know how they are going to hold up to a Nebraska winter. They are definitely for spring and summer and fall.  Eight shoes, great support. I like them better than my Brooks.",5
114704,I ordered the blue XS and it fits perfectly. Im 5'5 and 105 pounds and the skirt is totally what i was looking for in length. I wanted something high waist-ed but not too short. I didn't expect the skirt to look so expensive. Its a real bargain. The only complaint i have is that the underskirt can be a bit staticy and cling. but its not that serious.,4
86354,"I got some compliments for the dress and I wear it quiet often since I've gotten it. It doesn't look like the picture, I wish it did. The dress is more orange looking than red. Other than that it looks and feels nice. Obviously cheap fabric, but I like the feeling of it anyway. I love cheap dresses that look nice.",5
23414,"the pressure relief attachment pieces don't snap in, so they easily fall out when attempting to insert the stretcher. it takes a while to get them to stay put inside the boot, as well as in the correct position, which is disappointing. imagine a mr. potato head where all the pieces fall out. sad.",2
772345,"received this ring in a beautiful ring box to be disappointed with ring. tried to size it and the stone fell out. we should be told that you ca open a little. I would not recommend this product to anyone.

28533,"These are the backbone for my Lowa (Renegade M9.5) hiking/climbing boots. I have some finicky flat feet (M9, D Width) with bunions. I just finished 44.41 miles (5 days/4 nights) through the Grand Canyon on these bad boys. I walked away without any foot complications. I was an avid Super Feet blue fan, but they aren't compatible with Gortex  boots (sharp heel cup cuts into Gortex). Furthermore, the Pinnacles are softer on the toes and more supportive on the arch/heels. This is an unbeatable combination!",5
675450,"I normally don't take the time to write reviews but I had to make an exception here. This is by far the best wallet I have ever owned! Great quality, functional, sleek, and classy. The middle zipped pouch holds my iPhone 6 perfectly. I am considering getting a second one. Great product!",5
107145,"For any moment or occasion, that you would like to add an extra special touch. Get this box! Its made of a high quality. Anything that goes in it will stand out and shine even more. I'm very pleased with this purchase! They even made sure I got my box in time for my special day, Thanks Bright Box!",5
376479,"I bought these for my sister who loves them!  She said the different sparkly colored stones go with anything, the snap back is much easier to close compared to putting those small post backs on, plus the weight of the earrings is good, not too heavy, not too light.  They are very pretty so she gets lots of compliments on them.  I might just have to get myself a pair!  They will make a nice Christmas gift for someone on your list.",5
411155,Have not worn the shoes for a long period of time yet.  They feel fine & they are comfortable.  I hesitated to put all day wear when I had not worn them that long.  I like the rubber soles -- added comfort for my bad back.  Really nice shoes for the price.,5
116074,"I ordered this same dress in the past . I accutally just "" reordered"" from my past order list . The same dress did not come . It was larger and the neck line had changed . Still not a bad dress , but when u ordered the same thing you expect it the same .",2
628611,"Amazing, well-made, super classy luggage. Looks even better in person! I've received multiple compliments on it. 20"" size is perfect. No trouble fitting it in overhead bins and I'm able to pack for a week long trip in it. Rolls easily, wheels never get stuck/drag. Good design-- it has not tipped over once, even packed full. Pull up handle is nice and sturdy. The clothing straps are also well made and keep your clothes in place. I'd def buy this again or as a gift.",5
809817,"This dress is beautiful!  It definitely needs a slip under it because it is see through even with the lining.  I ordered an XXL and it fits like a medium.  I'm between a medium and a large and could really use the next size bigger if they made it that size.  The XXL fits fine, just a bit tight in the chest area.  Regardless, it is super cute.",4
313601,"If this came in a larger size, I would order MORE and give them 5 stars.  My gosh, that mesh pocket is absolutely amazing.  You feel the air on your goods, and when clothed you still feel all of it sticking out from your body against the fabric of your jeans.  I mean, it's nothing obvious to others, but YOU feel the sensation.  The mesh accommodates your member if/when it gets excited.  I wear a 34 normally, and the Large is just a tad too small.  But I'll still keep wearing them.  HA!",4
655867,"The top I got is a different cut than the one in the picture, which is disappointing. (The pointy section above her left boob isn't on mine, and the strap is different too.) The fit is also a little weird, with extra loose fabric in some parts. Despite these disappointments it's still a very interesting top, and I'm considering keeping it anyway.",2
198430,"Nice quality set, which unfortunately will wrap around very few ears, unless yours are small dainty ones. I attempted to simply accept a single earring to match the one accompanying the ear cuff (since the earcuff would not fit my ear AT ALL) rather than return the whole set, but was unsuccessful in both cases. Couldn't return set for credit... Or receive the single earring to make a set I could wear. I do wish to mention again, the product is well made & quite pretty.",2
677623,This shirt is hilarious and was a big hit.  My fiance was so excited to have an ugly Christmas sweater that fits his style of humor.  It was a bit larger than expected.  I don't now that I'd order down because of it but just expect that it may be a smidge larger than the usual measurements associated with the size you are looking for.  Shipping was fast and it arrived in perfect condition.,5
821648,"Got the medium because I expected this to be Asian sizing and luckily I did.  It fits snug on me and I'm normally a size small.  Dress is made out of a comfy, stretchy material.  All of the curves help enhance my curves.  Annoying thing is that it's dry clean only though I did hand wash it.  Lay flat to dry.  Wish it was washing machine safe.  Otherwise good dress.  I got this free in exchange for my unbiased review.  GOOD",4
691122,Order a size bigger....trust me. My wife looks awesome in this. She was smart to buy a size up. Please read other reviews so that you can avoid that common mistake associated with buying clothing online. those reviews will save you heartache and wasted time. i am definitely ordering from this seller again. The material is sound and we have experienced no problems with tearing or misshapen. My wife wants a blue one like this....so I guess I will start that order soon,4
173079,"I did not care for the fabric and the rouching under the bust area too much. Thr fabric is not clingy, which is a positive. The waist stitching hit right on my ""belly #2""...so it was not flattering. If your chest is larger than your belly, then this could work for you.",3
32457,"Bought these along with the gloves and also the HotHands Heated Fleece Headband for my daughter, who was working in Iowa during their extremely cold winter and had to spend part of the day outside.  She was quite happy to have all of these items and said they worked well to keep her warm.",5
170283,"I love this blouse. It is so different looking. I wear it all the time to the office with dress pants or wear it with a pair of jeans. I bought mine in grey and it's such a nice color and shade. It washes well and doesn't shrink, pill or wrinkle.",5
301294,"I've never bought maternity clothing before.. I ordered a size medium (expecting it to fit like a medium t-shirt from walmart) and it's a little too large for me at the moment. I'm 20 weeks pregnant and barley showing, in 5-10 weeks its should fit a lot better. I also for some reason thought the shirt was white... I wasn't paying attention, Its a grey-blue. Not a very flattering color but it is nice comfortable and stretchy! Hope I could help any shoppers!",4
227941,"Great quality of the material. I'm 5'4"" and 95 lbs, 32B cup, and the top fits very nicely. The skirt is a bit too large and I had to attach another velcro so it would hold on my waist. Also, the socks are darker than the blue on the skirt and the top, which makes it look kinda odd. But overall it is a great product for the price and I'm glad I bought it.",4
386540,"5'3, 125lbs, 32D, ordered size medium based on reviews. Fits amazing, very cute, and flattering. If I liked my sports bras super tight I could have got in a small, but I hate that compressed feeling - even though that's the point when you workout lol. Deff a little cleavy, and I'm loving it. But would probably have a nip slip after 3 burpees so I won't be using it for any HIIT haha.",5
520274,"Super cute! fit me perfect. (I'm 5'7 128 lbs)
Garter clasps were cheap and one broke off after 2 wears, the underwear that came with the set was ugly and way too big.
But I bought this with full knowledge that it might get destroyed during use ;)  I wasn't looking for long lasting lingerie.
With that in mind, the price is right and it looks gorgeous.",4
690308,This is soooooo small that not even a child can fit into it. No amount of stretching this will make it fit. I'm so upset because the picture and the descriptions are very misleading. I just don't know what to do because it looked like it was going to be a perfect fit for my skirt.,1
77253,"Let's face it: these are incredibly inexpensive throw-away boyshorts.  Don't expect anything else.  Some of the colors look incredibly cheap too - either go with it, or buy them for the fun reds and blacks just because they ARE inexpensive.  And order big - I'm tall and thin, and the large was perfect on me (hey, better to order large and have a perfect fit (clip the tag - who cares??) than have them snugging your hips too tight, right?).  If you can get a few uses out of these, amen.",3
121337,The ring is crap and so is the necklace. The necklace broke maybe an hour through wearing it and the ring isn't even visible or like they even gave a crap. But I've used the pocket watch and still do and love it. Not made out of the best materials still tho. I would say find a better one,5
765433,"I'm 5'5 200 lbs. 36DD I ordered a xxxl. It fit as expected but the top is a little too small. I still love the suit though and will be rocking it during my vacation!! Initially I was going to order the same suit from cocoship bit they didn't have my size, I'm glad I didn't because the peach one I did order from cocoship doesnt support my breast at all.",4
701647,"This is a really fun hat. It runs large, so wearing it with with glasses helps hold it up, or just tilt it back on your head. It does come rolled up in the package which squishes it, but I hung it up in a hot steamy shower as close to the water as possible for about 5 minutes and it straightened out perfectly.",5
133295,"Order up a size if you want to use for a longer period of time. I love UV Skinz and their clothing. We live in a higher altitude area and require more sun protection, in addition to sunscreen. These clothes have helped keep my kids exposure to a minimum while still being able to play. They even sent me an extra baby top to raise awareness of skin cancer awareness month.",5
232442,Beautiful! I received this item yesterday! Still didn't wear it but it looks beautiful and  cozy. The material is good and does not look cheap.. The length is nice too I can wrap it twice around my neck.  Price is good too!! Planning to order another one too! Just takes a month to arrive!,5
381304,"Beautiful scarf!! This scarf is super long and super soft.  I purchased the teal color and it's amazing!  It looks fabulous with a black top. The scarf is made well and feels like it is made of 100% silk as described from the seller.

I did receive this scarf at a discount for my honest review, which I have given.",5
643096,would have enjoyed the belt if it lasted longer than a month before the pin broke and fell apart from the buckle as I was wearing it. Of course this happens at the least opportune time and fell apart just before a wedding I was in. I really wanted to like it because it was half the price of some major competitors. wish I could say it lasted half as long. I got about 40 days of use so would not recommend.,1
618598,"This dress is to sexy! A day to go out with the friends would definitely be a go out outfit..very comfortable, the lace puts a nice touch in the front and back of the dress. It's not to tight and definitely not to loose. It fits perfectly! Shipped early than the expected date, I love it!",5
382287,"three days after it arrived in the mail, I was in PUBLIC and right after one zipper broke (VERY EMBARRASSING) THE OTHER ZIPPER FELL OFF, AND I  HAD TO PULL IT APART TO GET INTO IT, TO GET BUS MONEY, OMG--NEVER AGAIN!!

860252,"Color was a little different than what was shown on my phone- but not a big deal.
Sizes are as the information says. I am in between their sizes and should have ordered up.
Free returns though- much appreciated!
The style is simple and exactly what I am looking for- Ill definitely reorder the correct size.",4
258349,Needed boots that were waterproof but fun to wear so that the kids would actually wear them. They love stomping around in these boots. Size is a bit large on them but I did order the next size up from what they were wearing. Bottom line I would buy them again.,5
471819,"I ordered the white skirt, and it is almost completely see-through. I love the material it is made out of, and it is a beautiful skirt, but honestly it was totally unflattering. It made my waist look really wide for some reason. I would recommend buying this skirt, just not the white one.",3
335111,"Read some reviews and ordered a half size bigger than my usual size. They fit really well and look super cute! For the price they are pretty decent. No they are not your super pricey boot, so they probably won't last forever, but I have worn them three times and they are relatively compfortable and still look good as new.",4
119973,"This print is cute but item runs small - not sure if it's suppose to be tight since it's a swim item. I put this over a disposable swim diaper as well (but it's tight around his thighs even before I did this).

I also paid 13-14 for it at the time and saw the same brand at my local Target (different pattern than what I bought) for 9.99!",3
439379,"I absolutely love this sticker, the song, the message and Jesus. We got a new vehicle and needed a new Jesus Freak sticker.

57901,"I clip this to my work lanyard and put my work ID in the window and my Dexcon IGM device in the zip compartment, since I need it within several feet of the sensor at all times.  Keeps it clean and works great.  I'm sure you can find other off-label uses for this ID hlder.  Looks good too.",5
565575,"Comfortable and well-made, no loose threads or seams.  Only criticism is that the item arrived in a tiny parcel wadded up in a small ball.  Very wrinkled out of the package as a result.  I've since ordered and received another pair in a different color, quality and fit equally good, and packaging better!",5
698412,"i was looking for an overized sequin jacket to wear on new years. this fit the bill. i' a M, often going to L if i'm looking for that oversized look (or if i want to be able to wear something under). i went with a 2XL, and it fit exactly as i wanted. i did have it shortened. the jacket is longer than i anticipated (mid-thigh), and looked more like i was going to tap dance across a stage than go out on the town.",4
158720,"Theses are a great alternative yo the expensive name brand. The sock material may not be as good as the name brand (just a guess), but little ones will only be wearing them a few months and they definitely last longer than a few months. They are harder for my little one to pull off because of the sock-like fit. Also, great got those with hardwood floors. I ended up ordering 6 more pairs in various sizes and all are holding up well. Great for pre and early walkers. Definitely recommend.",4
455326,"I wasn't sure about this purchase initially-mainly because I usually order Jessica Simpson heels - for the comfort.
I have to say, these are absolutely AMAZING!!! I wear heels 8-10 hours a day, and these are my new favorites. Would love to be able to order more from the same vendor. Great investment!!",5
440438,"i chose this rating because when i opened the package everything was very nicely folded, no wrinkles or tears in the shirt. the fabric is very good quality and the blouse is versataile as far as where you can wear it to. I would recommend this product to anybody its great! you can also wear this blouse as a dress with leggings as well.",5
373621,My twin grand daughters (2 yrs old) started calling me Gigi as soon as they could talk - I was so Happy when I seen all the Gigi goods on Amazon.com.  The keychain is Terrific I even got a Grammy on for my mother as that is what they call her.  Thanks so much!,5
582591,My husband wears a size 13 and has a terrible time finding socks that fit well. This brand is terrific. Very comfortable for him and best of all a great fit. Will definitely continue with this brand. Both styles he tried are wonderful & make daily walking much more enjoyable. Returned to purchase several additional pairs already. Thank you Wigwam,5
688940,"I usually wear a medium shirt size but this is much more loose-fitting and baggy than I was expecting. It is definitely a costume shirt with multiple layers and made of costume-grade fabric, so I wouldn't wear it on a daily basis or anything. However, it looks very nice under a corset in a steampunk costume, which is what I bought it for, so I am happy with it.",4
332042,"Not only looks like a fine quality belt but it actually is.  I've ordered a few economically priced belts and this one is the best. Plus I was extremely impressed with how well it was packaged, everything covered to ensure no scuffs regardless of the roughness of the delivery itself.  Well done!!!",5
487731,"I have been getting items from Nic-e-shop for a couple months now and am Very happy with the quality and value. I just do not comprehend  how anyone can manufacture and ship at these prices and still make profit. The only draw back is the 17-28 days shipping time. As long as You are aware of this when ordering, I highly recommend them.  If bought locally in the USA price would be 10-50 times the price. (This is not an exaggeration).",5
418047,"I love this comfortable, pretty night shirt. It runs a bit large, but better than running small. I'm 5'1"" so it comes down to my calves, which is a little longer than usual. It is roomy and cozy though, and I like the top buttons you can open at night so there's no tightness anywhere and allows for full freedom of movement. It's also cute and feminine. VERY well-made.",5
44325,"What fun boots! They are super comfortable. I generally wear size 7 1/2 and the 8s fit perfect with a thin sock. They are not if cheap quality like the kind you find at the Halloween stores.

388043,Love this dress! Got lots of compliments at my baby's Red Egg and Ginger Party and the dress was able to hide all my rolls after having a baby.  The red was gorgeous! Bought the navy as well but only has if in medium and was a bit too tight. Hopefully after losing this baby weight I can fit into it.,5
708514,I received these shoes at a discounted rate. I love them! The only reason I give 4 stars is because the size runs a little small and I was not made aware of this. I am still able to wear them comfortably for a few hours. I think they look great and are very different looking!,4
341324,"Love the colors and the feel of material; however, I've worn two of the six and they both have had splits to come up in the crotch area before my work day was over. Since I wear longer tops, I'm still hoping to get a little wear out of them before I have to throw them away. I'm short so these also are a little long in length.",3
423460,Couldn't figure how to secure the bracelet.  It was tricky and there weren't any instructions. I thought it was missing a part. The dealer sent me money for postage and I sent it back. They promptly sent me another with which I had the same problem.  They talked me through it and sent a picture.  Voila!  Even though I felt like a dunce I do like it now that the mystery is solved. Hard to find turquoise in a watch which isn't Western in design.,4
165612,"If you can't afford Lululemon to save your life (ME!), these leggings are the peffect alternative.
However, they run a bit big. They may look small when you pull them out of the package but believe me. They are meant to open up and hug in all the GOOD ways.
I originally purchased a small. Then I ordered an XSmall. They fit absolutely PERFECT! I am 5'6"" and 130 lbs, pretty muscular as I am a practoicing yogi and yoga instructor. These leggings are my favorite. I will be exclusively buying leggings from 90 Degree by Reflex",5

These are the ""in"" thing amongst the teenagers,  so as a mother i did well.  The sweats are pretty thick.

495263,"At first j was a bit hesitant to order such a risqu dress . Then got it in the mail and thought ""there's no way I'm going to fit nicely in this"". Then tried it on and it fit like a glove!!! Love this dress  can't wait to wear it",5
787052,I love the wallet. It is one that I have wanted. The color the style is all that I have wanted and needed. It has enough card holders that is also needed. There is one minor thing that I would change and that is where the ID goes the hole to slide it out is not large enough to slide it out. I would have made that a little larger in diameter.,5
351337,"I ordered these hoping I would get a nice set, however, when I went to clean them with alcohol the black color came off. It also stained my fingers a bit black. What happens if that came off in my ear? So much for the shattered quartz, I just have clear glass plugs and a total run around on my return.",1
402345,"I recently went camping and bought these last minute at Academy. On the trails everyone else was slipping and sliding but me. This is my first pair of real hiking boots so I have nothing to compare them to but regardless they exceeded my expectations. They are very sturdy, very comfortable, and kept me dry and sure-footed on the trail. Definitely worth the price.",5
860447,"I love this tank, but it does run a little small. It fits, but not flattering. My husband will sometimes call me wifey, so of course I had to get it!  Its made of Polyester and Spandex, its more of a beachwear or casual. You can dress it up, but usually when you dress up your clothes don't ""say"" anything.
My husband likes it, but it's more of a around the house tank.

241053,I love this band! I bought it because at work we are not allowed to wear rings with stones in them. My hands are in chemicals very frequently at work and this ring hasn't been phased at all. It's super durable and has a great shine. The sizing is right on as well. I love that it is more of a skinny band since I have smaller hands and a plain band is usually too clunky on me. This one is perfect!,5
261210,"I ordered an xlarge because I'm usually a medium and occasionally a large. I also wanted to wear it strictly as a dress so the longer the better, the extra large is huge! I should have gotten a medium or maybe a large.... It's cute just a little long and big. I think it'll look okay with heels but if you are ordering get your normal size",3

My calves are relatively thin but not toned so the fit is not as smooth as I would like. At places where the design is they tighten a bit so they seem ""drawn"" and the shape of my calf is not smoothly contoured but it's not too obvious and not uncomfortable so maybe they'll get a little looser in time.",4

The best thing about it was that it looks just as good as a suit but it's very comfortable for a baby as well! It's a one piece made with clothy material and very soft, unlike how some suits are just so uncomfortable for babies. No need to worry about pants being too tight if your little one is chubby.",4
429805,"I tried it on. I just looks cheap.  Smaller than shown in pic.  The edging is ugly.  I wasn't happy with 90 percent of what I ordered from this company.  Mainly because of cheap material, and didn't look good in person.  Also almost always run way small.  Even though the stuff is cheap, I wasted my money because I can't wear any of it.",2
166193,"I love these tights. I am 5'8 and they feel longer than most capris. They are a nice heavy fabric. They fit perfectly. They definitely don't run small, so they are either true or refreshingly comfortable. I am an 8 or 10 or 30 , 31 in pants/ jeans. I have tried the medium, and they fit but are more like compression tights. Either way you can't go wrong, it's just a matter of fit preference",5

3625,"I ordered this costume in a Large, because I am really tall, average fit and have big boobs that usually spill over smaller sizes. This costume was not just too large, it was huge and disproportionate. I felt like Fiona, from Shreck. The design is by no means flattering to anyone who is not model size.",1
328112,"This is an absolutely gorgeous ring. However I noticed when putting it on, it's missing two stones. I don't want a refund. I just want another one sent for the embarrassment my fiance has to experience when I showed him. I will return the bad one when I have another on my finger.",3

65481,"Absolutley love em. They came 2 days early which is a big plus. After counting and sorting..... there were actually 102. Which is fine by all means. Being a guy, some of the more girly ones I wound up selling to my ex for more than I paid on here. XD  they all had matching sets to go along with each other. All in all it was well worth the money. I would definitely recommend these to anybody.",5

they can only be worn with tee shirt thickness and the 1X is way too big.

But now after carrying it for a week, it's gotten on my nerves, it's definitely only a front pocket carry wallet(which I don't do front carry).

It's got ZERO drop resistance.",2

Since I needed it for an event that same week, I chose to wash it instead of returning it. I soaked it in a stain removing detergent overnight. Fortunately the spot on the collar disappeared but the one on the back only got smaller.

The price was right and the delivery excellent. But buyer beware.",3

Super lightweight but also a little thin in the sole, very flexible.",2
151683,This is a cute shirt and nice quality. I would say that it runs a little big. I very consistently wear a large and I bought the large. I think I could have easily gone down a size. It is made to be oversized so it depends on how you like to wear it but it is wide so there is a lot of flow to it.,5

I wouldnt recommend the product to anyone who has a case for their phone.  i tried plugging it into my iphone 6 that has a very lightweight case on it but it doesnt fit due to its size.  If you don't have a case, then maybe this will work for you.  if you have a phone that plugs into the other side (not the lightning port), then maybe this will work for you.",2
142772,For the price especially this was a nice treat to myself. I bought hair pins to match as well. It isn't silver but it doesn't look shabby with rounded edges on the vines like can happen sometimes. It is quite pretty and the clasps seem like they are good quality.,4
856586,"Super cute. Ordered xl.  Could have gone with large but plan to wear these to work and wanted form fitting with out skin tight and revealing. Such a steal for 10 bucks.  I ordered the light blue and mint green. True to colors shown.  I'm 5""6 and 185 lbs",4

She is an 8/10 and ordered the XL to be safe but was still a little tight. Seller immediately shipped out an XXL and it was perfect. Definitely runs quite small. Don't allow a size to defer you this is a nice shirt,5

It's not the same color as the picture, the top doesn't match the rest of my dress ( I ordered the blue). I wanted to wear this dress on my 21st birthday with some heels but the dress isn't long enough! It ends awkwardly at my ankles. I'm only 5 foot five. I'm very disappointed with it. They only got the bottom half right and it's not even long enough. It just looks ridiculous.",1

A large would not have worked either as the fit was just strange. Also, I ordered thinking it was a dress but actually was more like a swimsuit coverup. The material was very thin and see thru. Would not recommend this dress. Very disappointed !!",1

44515,Bought these for a SuperGirl costume.  I was worried about comfort and bought them in a size bigger than usual. Are not tight but are in no way big. They are surprisingly comfortable although I put in a gel insole. They are squeaky but it's not a big deal. I'm happy I bought them!,4
514430,"This Dress is simply okay. From the picture you expect to get this beautiful dress that fits awesome, but its not. Instead of the blue lace being sewn in it is just a lace overlay.

If you have long nails it's kind of hard to get them in so, experiment a little until you find a technique.

My grand daughter has only worn them a couple of time, and after washing them, the lace flower on the back are coming loose and fraying.  The bow is not user friendly.

What the seller forgot to show or mention is the back of this costume uses SWAT as an anagram for ""Sexy .... ..... ....""

713976,The jacket is very nice quality and my daughter loved it. The only problem is it runs insanely small! She is normally a size 6 so we started with the small. Then went to a medium and it was too small. Then went to a large and she is keeping it although she can't really fold her arms across her body without it feeling tight. It just needs to be made bigger by the manufacturers!,3

Bottom line it's just a matter on convienence.",3

As mentioned on other posts the part around my bottom is loose.  I bought a large but think a medium would be to tight around the upper body.  Overall though its cute.  Threw on some boots and holy jeans just so I can rock the look!",4

The print is done well and seems like it will hold up . I have washed it about 4 or 5 times and there's no fading yet and the shirt didn't shrink at all as far as I can tell. I just got a blue French bully so I got it in blue because it's really hard to find things with blues on them.,5
43603,The umbrella is very cute but it showed up with a powdery substance all over it. I am not sure if they put it on the product on purpose to keep it from sticking to itself but it makes it look dirty. I will have to clean it before giving it as a gift.,4

About the piece: The stones are very pretty and truly catch the light, however the necklace is more of a bib style-meaning it will drape from your collarbone. So those wanting a longer piece this is not the one for you.

My only recommendation to the seller is to provide an extension in the necklace for those with larger necks or those that prefer a longer chain.",5

The arms are fitted to just above the elbows, but the rest of the top is unstructured and perfect to pair over a skirt or with jeans!  The only down side was that it appears to have shipped from China.  This can be problematic and take quite a bit of extra time.",5

The dress is sheer as expected and beautiful I think. I ordered one the 6th of July and received my order on the 16th of July. Personal note, it is very flowy from behind and just looks super cool in the breeze, if your bohemian, like me, go for it honey you won't be disappointed.",4
764722,These swim bottoms are perfect for ladies who do not like short bottoms that show too much. They come to mid calf so you don't get too hot. I also LOVE that the skirt is stitched so it does not ride up in the water. I highly recommend this product.,5

160208,"Very nice shirt. Very soft. It fits just like the picture. The length and size are accurate. I ordered a medium and it fits like the photo. The sides being scrunched up is SO CUTE. The only complaint is that it's a bit see through. Not much though, just a tad.",4
324046,"Wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing this! This is a complete waste of money. The sweater that was delivered is not the same sweater as in the picture, and is very cheaply made as well. Good thing I bought a back up Christmas gift because this is terrible. Extremely disappointed.",1
485315,"Great dress for the price. On smaller sizes the sparkle covers more of the torso of the dress than the photo shows. The lace up corset type design is perfect for online ordering! It makes it so you can lace it up and wear it without having to have it tailored any. It was a little on the big side for my daughter (.. and we ordered it a size smaller than she would normally wear; She would normally wear a size 6, is about 115 lbs, 5' 2 1/2"" tall & wears a 32B).",5
783245,"Very nice set.  The tie is a little skinnier  than expected but overall happy with quality, etc.  My husband and son were able to match for Easter at a very reasonable price. I would order again.
I received this product at discount for review,  however it is my own.",5
97057,Order a size larger. I'm a tradition large in the states and judging by the provided size chart a m/l for these clothes. I ordered a large but should have gone for the xl. It fits fine in the stomach but there is a tight band at the bottom to encourage the flowy look...that is tight cuz I have a generous bottom and it's a little snug in the boobs (38dd so it's expected). Arms and shoulders are perfect though. Still wearable and looks cute just not like picture.,4
650604,"Don't waste your money.  This looks nothing like the picture.  It was cheap enough so instead of returning it to China, I'll use it as a night gown.  Lining goes to about mid thigh and the material is very flimsy.  Also, if you are taller than 5'2"" it will be too short. I'm 5'6"" and it hits just above my ankle.",1
870448,"I ordered the XXL.  My normal U.S. size is a M-L.  My bust is 38+.  The top is just a tad tight in the mentioned area.  My shoulders are 17 inches.
The top almost fits me perfect.  Looking forward to wearing it this summer!
I will mention one small negative here.  After washing there are several loose threads that need to be trimmed off.  To me that is a nothing.  But to someone who might be pickier...",5
83016,"The design and quality of the wallet are great. The only thing that made me not give it five stars was a rubber band wrapped around it with a tag on it. It warped the wallet a little on both sides, and it seems like it is really unnecessary since it is in a box. Other than that, I love it.",4
778869,In description it says it is unisex. It is definitely not and the neck is super wide. I would have worn it if the neck wasn't so stank. I wear a Small and ordered a large. Idk how they think this size is a large but ok. It barely fit,1
138615,"These pants are super comfortable and have room for the belly bump to grow. I am 16 weeks along and normally wear a small prepregnancy so that's what I ordered. I wear them for barre class and they are perfect, flexible with no binding/pinching and you cannot see through them, I'll be ordering another pair to rotate in for sure!",5
721386,"This will be nice to run to the store in or hang out around the house. For the price, what did I expect. It is not a quality garment. The color is true to the picture. Pretty much this is you get what you pay for, buy cheap and that is what you get.",3
170023,"Disappointed. Thought I was getting knuckle rings, but they are regular sized rings. My fingers are a bit pudgy so they don't fit on the top or bottom of my fingers lol. Good thing they were so cheap. I found doubling up on the skinny ones is my best bet, even though they give me a little bit of a muffin top effect.",2
391115,"Super cute! I ordered a size up for my boys to grow into over the summer but they run somewhat small so thankfully i did order the size up! One was a 5t but fits my 4 year old (36 lbs), and then one was a 3t and fits my 2 1/2 year old (31 lbs).",4
170501,"The waist fits as a large but the length is way too long. I'm 5'6"" and even in wedge sandals the pants were like a set of drapes on the floor. I even washed them in hot water and dried them on high hoping to shrink them with no luck.  Not sure when I'll actually wear these unless I get them hemmed.",4
865768,"This is hands down my new favorite summer dress. It fits well. Wears well. The upkeep is fantastic. Wash, dry and no ironing needed. I  dress it up with a little short sleeve bolero, jewelry, and dressy shoes. I  dress down with just some flip-flops. Extremely versatile. This can take you from the beach to a nice evening out.",5
329801,"They came quickly which was a plus, and looked very much like the picture. I did not like the quality of the lenses due to the fact the style is a flat pair of glasses the lenses seemed to bend where they were attached causing divots. I returned the glasses same day.",2
351592,"These leggings are seriously comfortable. They are probably the most comfortable workout leggings I own. That being said, you can most definitely see through them. If you plan to wear them, wear them with a really long shirt because otherwise the whole world will know what color underwear you're wearing.
If I were to buy them again, I'd probably go with a darker color. I got them in gray because they were out of black when I purchased them.
I like them, but I don't love them, and I would probably not recommend them to anyone else",3
27873,"Don't know how my husband functioned before without these. Real support and fit inside shoes that can have the insert removed that was inserted when manufactured. Durable and can be cleaned, wear good, he had had them over a year, He has fallen arches and this really gives the support needed. Great price compared to shoe stores.",5
727898,"I really liked this item but wow, was it big for the size!!  Very long...I am only 5 foot 5 inches and it hit my mid thigh.  I gave it to my niece who is much taller than I am since shipping was going to be way expensive to return.  She looks great in it!!",3
127305,"My 8 yr old is on the thin side, he wanted an alternative to belts. I wondered if they would look cheap, costumish but NO. They are very adorable, I love him with these on. Another important note--the clips have an extra plastic like piece inside to grip the garment well. Not all have that. makes these much better than others. Great buy, I will get more colors.",5
770739,"Absolutely love the swimsuit! I'm 5'3 and 115lbs and wear size small. Beautifully cut bottoms, the only reason I give it a 4 instead of a 5 is because the top that comes with the size small is obnoxiously big. I am 34A, and even my friend with DD said the triangle top was too big for her.",4
625817,"AWFUL cut. NOT long enough wear with leggings if you want anything covered. The cute flair of the shirt shown in the picture actually starts much higher in person and is much more severe. Combined with the length, its really unflattering.

480655,"The dress was beautiful and it fit well for my 13 year old daughter going to her first ball and banquet. We were surprised that it also came with optional straps (to sew on if wanted) and a matching scarf wrap.  The only negative thing is the crystal embelishment can catch on the easily pulled material. But we wrapped it in tissue paper until she was dressed.  Even with this issue, we LOVED the dress.",5
565270,"I wear a men's medium for everything and a large when I want it to be baggy. I bought a large for this and it was if I had a small on. This is designed for people with toothpick arms and shoulders.

Also, before you judge I just bought numerous UnderArmour brand clothing and the mediums were baggy. So if you order and have some muscular form this will be highly uncomfortable in the arms and chest.",1
338051,"This took some time putting on and when I
I did get it on it was very uncomfortable having a,piece of thin fabric uo my behind if you're used to wearing thongs you won't have any problems wearing this I did however see a difference in the shape of butt from the side and the back see attached photos didn't do much for slimming my stomach area either",4
386602,"Quality seems really good.  Thick fabric.  Secure seams.  Nice color.  Unfortunately runs so small it was a bit ridiculous.  I read other reviews and purchased based on some of the feedback.  I am a 34 A and figured the small would fit nicely, but it about strangled me it was so small and tight.  I would definitely go up a size.",3

328769,"The colors are a little bit brighter but that makes me love it even more to be honest, it's great for summer! Nice and clear pattern. I'm usually a small but I ordered a Medium this time because of hips and butt, and it fits perfectly. With cup size 32B-C a Medium top fits perfectly as well. The gap between the breasts with those strings looks large but shapes nicely! I'm very happy with this order.",5
383155,"Excellent boyshorts. They're extremely breathable without the soft material being too thin. They're also very flexible. I got the same colors shown and they're really cute. I bought them as undies but am also wearing them around the house because they're not as revealing as booty shorts. Great for yoga too because they don't ride up at all, and the legs don't roll up either. I'm recommending these to friends, they're a great deal.
I got the L/XL. My hips are 34"", I'm a bit over 6 feet tall and 145 lbs and these fit perfectly, with some room to spare.",5
721231,"Incredibly ornate rhinestone bag - stunning and exquisite (extra beads included). The beads are a beautiful red - black beaded background and silver chain.

The Caribbean Joe shorts came close but I did not like the red color. That's just a personal preference. Caribbean Joe's size 12 was also snugger than my LLB's. I returned them and am still looking. I'm prepared to be patient. These short are genuine classics, and it's sale season after all.",3

It's lightweight, comfortable, easy to read and keeps perfect time. Did I mention it's a great-looking watch?",5
22954,"The stretcher seems mechanically sound and well built (sturdy). My problem with this item is that it is too narrow near the tip so it can not be inserted far enough into the show/boot to stretch the width near the toe area.

We'll see how they launder and wear..,",4
434233,I got these as a gift for my 5 year old daughter. I was a little skeptical because i wasn't sure how well they were made. Once I got them I was very happy.

They are only lucky post mortem, for the holder of said feet - and therefore even though the bunnies themselves have 4 of them, are completely a liability to said animal.

If you happen to be in the market for natural white/grey rabbit feet, these guys are swell.",5
503079,I am a larger breasted person so I was worried this would be too revealing. It wasn't too bad. After wearing it a few times it became one of my favorites. It is very flattering fit and comes down low enough in the front to not ride up and show my mid section. The colors are also a nice camoflage,5

The bottom of the sweater does stretch out as you wear it but the utility of the sweater far outweighs this small nuance for me.",4

It is a lovely piece but if I had realized how big it was I wouldn't have gotten it. I guess that is what I get for buying online rather than in a store though. Even with that I would buy from them again as it seems very sturdy and well put together and it is really very pretty.,4

I think the Asscher cut makes the ring look too clear and perfect and up close someone may suspect it isn't a real diamond.

Below is what I said before I actually handled the bracelet, never even got to wear mine, I moved it twice in my jelewry box and the next time I touched it, was to wear it and it broke! I have no idea how it happened, just fell apart in my hands.

I ordered eight, I received eight, took about two weeks to get. I bought them for wedding party gifts.

When I opened the package and held the bracelet it felt like more plastic then fabric.

You definitely get what you pay for.",2

Highly recommend.",5

So with this one id say buy a size up. Besides that the shirt is cool just too small and as it streches the color fades.. 3 stars.",3
865850,I love this product! It has such a flattering cut to it! The only reason I give it a 4 star rating is because I bought 2 different Troyes of shirts from this shop via Amazon prime.

196086,"Great owl necklace. Was so happy when I got it in. The owl looks just like the picture and love the size of it. It did not have a lobster clasp, but that did not bother me because I had 200 of them. The price is amazing and no shipping cost GREAT. I recommend buying this instead of buying one that is $20.00. It looks the same as the high price ones, but cheaper! Might buy more and give as gifts or make something with them!",5
233049,"This functional little wallet is wonderful for those on-the-go!  It's listed as a men's wallet, but I found it great to fit into a blouse pocket or the pocket of a pair of skinny jeans so that I don't get that unsightly bulge.  If you are a 'bra-tucker',  you can tuck this little wallet with all of your important things in your bra for safe-keeping.  I will definitely recommend to my friends!

This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.",5
86332,"Not really a huge fan of the belt that comes with this but all in all, love the dress...light and airy, the fit is great, just save yourself the headache and follow the size chart. Covers 2/3 of my thigh (I'm 5'3) and I think it's perfect for the summer....I've also received another dress from this seller IN WHICH I AM I LOVE WITH!!! To all readers, do not be snobs about this company, I'm so happy I didn't listen to the bad reviews. Let's be honest ladies, with this price, it's not going to be Vera wang quality...",5
435892,"I bought the TAWATEC titandiver with a black rubber band and love the watch. Love the rubber dive band as well. I bought the titanium band just to change the look and I love it.  The titanium band matches the watch perfectly (titanium).  I get tons of compliments. Now if everyone just knew the answer to the question ""what the hell is TAWATEC.""  A badass watch, that's what.",5
516505,It does a run a tad big. I usually wear a L/XL flex fit hat and some run small so I was leary about buying an XL. I bought the XXL and its a little big but I washed and dried it once and now its perfect. My recommendation would be to buy up a size and shrink it in the dryer. These hats do not stretch like a normal flex fit so if you buy small you will be hosed.,5
479493,I got this wallet as a gift and initially scoffed it off as a piece of junk I had to store somewhere. After 5 years of use this wallet is still holding up strong. The leather and craftsmanship are of very high quality. I don't think I'll ever buy a different brand of wallet again. Nocona is one of the best.,5
168894,"My wife loves the way the ring looks and feels.  The ring is exactly as described.  Definitely a good quality ring.

This ring is a good replacement for wedding bands that may not fit the same anymore due to pregnancy, which is what prompted my reason to purchase this ring.",5
698123,"The shoulder cutouts are so small they look stupid. The sleeves are tight not flowy. The material is soft but is the kind that clings to you instead of having movement. I ordered a 2XL (2 sizes up like all the reviews suggested). The 2XL fits my sons girlfriend (size 8-10) somewhat like the picture. Although the sleeves were still snug. And like the other reviews, the weird seam from the neck to the arm pit looks very strange. If you are expecting this shirt to look anything like the photo, it won't.",1
755919,"Ordered this for my game room and YouTube videos. Appreciated the decent material and craftsmanship for the price. The Sega logo is a bit narrower than it should be and isn't as nearly bright as the picture would have you believe, but otherwise it is a solid product that is made well. Not bad at all for the money.",4
516954,"I love this! Fits very nicely around my waist- however I did not know that I couldn't fit ""it"" in the pouch, I'm too long & thick. I can still wear it but it's not as nice as it could be. I still give it 5 stars because I love the way it looks and I get lots of ""those are so cool!"" This was delivered much faster than I thought! A+.",5
379886,"These socks are only rated up to size 10, so I knew when I bought them that they may not be long enough I wear a 10.5). The stickies on the bottom only came up to just below my heel, and the back of the sock did cover up to my ankle. So I would not recommend these socks if you foot size is larger than a 9.  Even though these were sized up to a 10, I don't think they should have been this small for a 10.5 size foot.",3
441091,"I like these scrub tops.  As an ER nurse, they are exactly what I needed- the most pockets I could find in a top. I like that it fits a little large- I need the room to move, bend and stretch without worrying that I'll be exposing skin or underwear.  The material is a little stiffer than some brands, but not uncomfortable. I have been wearing them for several months now, and they have held up wonderfully.  For the price and the convenience I'll definitely be buying more of these when I need new scrubs!",4
655511,"I had to contact the seller directly multiple times, mostly for rushed shipping questions, and they were very helpful and got back to me quickly! dress is well made, but is VERY hard to get on and off. Somehow this dress is too tight to come on easily, but was too large at the top when on. Overall it's a nice dress and the sellers are helpful it just fits a little strange",3
23941,"I like hats but my I generally do not look good in Baseball caps. I bought this because I was planning to go on hiking trip and needs headware. I loved this prod it. The hat fit well, it looked good and did its job well (keeping sun and rain out of my eyes). I definite buy if you like hats.",5
191869,I'm an average size 12 and a Large is more like a small.  I couldn't even put my arm in the shirt to even try it on.  I'm glad I didn't pay too much cause to return it to China would have cost more than the actual shirt.,1
487617,"I picked this up for my (almost) two year old son for Christmas! I love it! I figured the picture of the rein deer would be like most decals on clothing, but it's more of a soft ""embroidered"" look. Very cute and would absolutely recommend this seller & product to anyone!",5
409806,"My husband wanted a simple, but durable ring with a little bit of character. This one looks like it fits the bill, and on receipt, it was very lovely. With constant wear, however, the finish comes off pretty quickly and the actual finish is a matte gunmetal gray, rather than silver. My husband absolutely adores it, and that's really all that matters, but I had hoped it would wear better.",3
755009,"Jacket fit well for the most part, very snug fit, will they say small they mean small. I am 55 and about 130 pounds, this was very snug for me. It definitely kept me warm, so I would recommend wearing this only on a cold day. Jacket is stylish, but after traveling across the country I noticed the left wrist strap button came off",4
282282,"This dress is my new favorite dress. It's dark enough to be appropriate for winter, but the lace makes it fit well in Spring or Fall as well. I am quite curvy (5'5"" size 10-12 pants) this dress was both flattering and fun! Flared in all the right places to look almost like a mermaid dress, without clinging to my hips. The fabric is slightly stretchy for lots of comfort and forgiveness around the rounder parts of the body.",5
342050,Broke first day I wore mine and same for my daughter . I understand the price was very small but I was hoping that didn't mean it would be that cheaply putt together . Don't think I'll buy from this vender again . Just because it's a killer price fits not mean it's necessarily a great deal,1

It sheds, but I ain't worried, because it's beautiful. I get tons on compliments,& it's very warm. Estimated delivery was almost 2 months. IT ARRIVED IN 2 WEEKS!!! Best suprise opening my mail box to that unexpected gem. I got mine in the white faux fur. I am 36dd, 5'7"", 150lb. Bottom sits just below my hip bone and snaps in the front with slight give.",5
600038,"I purchased this blazer because I was looking for a statement blazer for work. It's not a bad blazer, but you definitely get what you pay for. The fabric is probably a bit on the shiny side for my taste, but it's a decent enough if you don't stare. The color was fine and it looks like the picture.",3
641847,I like it but it is a bit thin and I don't feel comfortable wearing it out much because I feel like I'm showing my nipples. Not sure why it's so hard to find an American flag one-piece so it's good enough for me to keep and just wear in my backyard or friends.,3
112794,"WORTHLESS!!  Only acceptable for an expensive pair of children's play glasses.  Purchased at Walmart for $9.99 to use for deer hunting at 100-yds; blurry, not 40x magnification as advertised (my cheap 10x binoculars did a much better job).  I hope Walmart didn't pay much for the inventory, cuz took mine back for credit - suggest you do the same.  Please don't waste your money!

Actually less than 1-star in my book.",1
288605,"One of the best things you can buy to look professional at work. It takes some getting used to but the outcome is beyond amazing. I had a few really good ""Classic"" fit shirts (normally wear ""Slim"" fit), which I was about to give away because they usually come loose around the waist. After wearing them with the Shirt Stays, they stay tucked in as good as the slim fit shirts. One of my best buys of 2016!",5
365093,"If you are tall be leary, I'm 5'3"" and it comes above my knees, I am also big chested to that accounts for some.  All of that aside it is perfect!

347769,"The top on the model appears to cover her rear end and is much longer than the top actually is.  She must be a very short model as this top only goes a little past my hip.  I was hoping to wear it with leggings, but it's way too short. (I'm 5' 10"" tall)",2
533497,The quality of the gloves are amazing.  Thick great quality. Sadly. they were just HUGE.  My son is 4 and a half years old. But he is on the small side. These gloves were almost the size of his arms lol. Sadly we sent then back. But they truly are great quality. I would recommend them to a bigger kid.,3
253647,"Bought this one and the yaluxe wristlet, they both look the same, and they do! Same leather feel, same size, same compartments. Only difference is the Belfen has a polyester card holder compartment and the yaluxe has a PU leather outlining the compartment (inside is polyester as well). I just prefer that yaluxe one because of that.

Minus half a star for no tassle keychain on the Navy color.",4
513358,"It fit as expected, since I knew to order 2 - 3 sizes bigger. I usually wear a size 8. This is almost that big. Very flimsy. Definitely not machine washable. Barely hand washable. Could even be wear once. Glitter is already flaking and I have not done anything but put it on a hanger. Similar to picture. For the price I should not complain.",3
125804,"Amazing look to the necklace, bought for Halloween, perfect for my outfit, but it looks like it's for a child. The smallest hook is about as big and my ankle. The biggest is about 3 inches smaller than my average neck. Had to buy an extension. Also had a bunch of random loose strings hanging, just poorly made. But for $5, I will make it work. Wouldn't wear it on an ordinary day....",2
216642,"Love the look and the sun coverage but I've had it for about 4 months and it's already broken at the top. Also, will shape and bend however it is placed, which is super annoying, but you can always manipulate it to shape it back to its original form. However that is inconvenient and for the price I expected better. But it is very comfortable, and fits big heads like mine haha.",3
538350,"Nice knit, and doesn't make my skin itch at all! They look like they'd fit too tightly, but they loosen up nicely. These are not long gloves, but they do go high enough on my forearm that my coat sleeves cover them. I wear them in the office to keep my hands warm at the computer.",5
703333,"I ordered this belt for my 16 year old step son and he absolutely adores it. It made me the best step mom ever. Kids these days are all into name brand and lets just be real, not all of us can afford a real Hermes belt for our teenagers. This is an amazingly cheap option. It looks so real that no one has been able to tell the difference. We were afraid the H would be too small and noticeably fake but it wasn't at all.",5
435614,"I ordered the large based on the reviews that said to order a size larger than you usually do. Well, I cannot button it up at all. It fits like a small. I am 5'3"", 145lbs and a 36C bust. The large is too small, so if you're a Med...order XL and it may fit.",2
566170,"I am giving this shirt 3 stars.  I purchased 2 medium-sized shirts and both fit differently.  This one was too large for me, but the color was beautiful and the material is awesome.  I should have ordered a size down.  I gave the shirt to my daughter and will probably purchase again. :)",3
42590,"This product is cheap both in price and quality.  The good: it's very lightweight and comfortable.  The bad: they break real easy so you have to consider them disposable.  They did the job as required but due to the fact they they don't have much shelf life, I probably won't purchase again.",3
68024,"Love them. They did give a little after wear, but I still love the fit. I bought short length as I am 5'1-1/2"". My legs are long for my height, was hoping they were just a tad longer to allow for shrinkage. You will love the comfort. I have always purchased Fit Couture brand.",4

775184,"I was SO excited about this dress. And then is FINALLY arrived and I am so disappointed. It's embroidered... not embellished... and made from a completely different fabric than I was expecting and is too small.
You get what you pay for, for sure. It's too bad... I would pay good money for the actual dress in the picture.",1
484813,Everything seems perfect except it was shipped to me with a whole in it. Seems easy enough to fix. But I'm not happy I paid for something for it have a whole in it. This was a Christmas present to my daughter but not it need to be fixed before I can give it to her.,5

Fitted around arms, which is what my man prefers but a comfortable fit around rest of body and length to match. There is a musty, baby urine diaper smell to it. I used color safe bleach and liquid fabric softener and it seemed to not smell as pungent. I received this product at a discount in exchange for honest review.",4
360858,They say they are made of stainless steel but I doubt that because they irritated my skin within hours of wearing them.  My ears are always sensitive to cheap earrings but not stainless steel so..... the CZ is nice looking but I don't love the setting. I really bought them for my daughters but not sure if they will be able to wear them either due to sensitivity.  These were super cheap so my expectations weren't high to begin with!,2
446875,"These earring jackets are beautiful and graceful.  But they are much smaller than expected.  If you want to see the curve at the top of the jacket, you'll need to use a 6mm stud.  The jacket is just 20mm from top to bottom.  Wish the size had been in the description.  They are nice with a pair of small pearl earrings I have, but too small for other gemstone studs I own.  Still deciding whether or not to return them.",4

I had been advised that this metal would not cause the same problem and I did not want to go ring-less. Given the price, I expected just an ok ring. This thing is the bomb!

Very cozy, soft, warm and absorbent.",4

It didn't reach the floor and she is 5'5"" and well proportioned so it's not like she has real long legs. Still, she likes it and it fits her well around the waist. The sizing says it will fit 6-8 and she wears size 3-5 jeans (depending upon the jean).",5

It is relatively light weight and the metal doesn't pull my hair when I take it off.,5

Go figure. 8 pairs was cheaper than local. 2 blue camp & 2 green camp for when you don't want anyone to see your briefs. 2 black pair for night maneuvers. 2 green pair for when you feel like a giant. Always protect your fruit by wearing fruit of the loom.,5
63455,I ordered this bases off the reviews. They were helpful but I should have never ordered this item. This is great if short skirts are what you like. I'm a pear shape and this doesn't help out either. I'm much smaller on top. I'm a med on the bottom and a small up top. So over all the skirt was to short for my taste and I just didn't have enough upstairs to hold the darn thing up.,3
292008,Arrived ahead of expected date. Badges were out of order but easy enough fix. Some of the pins were bent? Easy enough fix with a pair of needle nose pliers. So just minor complaints. Easy open box and they are good quality pins! Adding them to my pokemon collection! 10/10 Will be ordering the rest of the sets.,5

Oversize chic and 100% hijab ;) Will be ordering in every single color.",5

875358,"I'm a plus-sized girl, and I found these to be a bit on the small side.
The lace was able to stretch enough to accommodate this, however, and seems to be durable enough that it doesn't feel like it will rip easily.
Instead of them being more flowy, they fit more like skinny jeans and show off the curves of my legs.
Overall I am satisfied, though they didn't exactly fit as I expected, I will still be able to wear them.",4

And I will definitely be buying more Scarleton bags in the future.",5
92836,This shipped and received as expected.  I purchased a size larger than normal and this fit perfect. I wore it (yesterday out on a boat)for the first time and found it very comfortable. It is a bit thin and there is no liner which wouldn't be a problem if I was wearing this as bike shorts but I purchased it for the beach. Haven't worn it in the water so I can not rate that situation.,4
748948,This sweatshirt is perfect for any American Horror Story fan. The sweatshirt is nice and light but keeps you warm on those chilly nights.

I received thls sweatshirt at a discounted or free price.,5
376402,"It's very cute. It is much larger than I thought. I'm 5'7 & weigh 140 lbs. I bought large and it was bigger than I'd like. But it's very cute for the price. And the fabric doesn't look cheap at all.

I was not paid or asked to leave a review. I like to leave reviews on all of my things because I'm a mom and love cheap deals :) Would buy again just wish sizing was better.",3
414708,"I actually purchased this for my mom 2 yrs ago for Mother's Day. To this day, it is still holding up despite being worn nearly everyday by her. It has a very sturdy construction and most people think it came from some fancy-schmancy jewelry store. They are shocked when she tells them that it is actually a free-trade product made by artisans in another country. She always receives so many compliments on it. If you want a beautiful piece of jewelry that holds up well and doesn't make you feel guilty, this is it.",5
424704,"This item is absolutely beautiful, but not for everyday wear.  I wore mine everyday for a little over a month and stones started falling out.  My husband is a little heartbroken because it was supposed to be an anniversary present I could depend on.  I guess you get what you pay for.",3

835679,"Love Black Sabbath and absolutely LOVE this wallet! Stays shut and does the job. Ive had it for about 6 months and still in good condition. Only issue is it cant hold too much change at any point in time. A few coins at most. Would not recommend to someone who wants alot of space in a wallet. It holds the basics (cards, money,id) and thats good enough for me.",4
24332,"Huge and out of proportion. I know you're supposed to buy a size down from what u normally buy, but even a size down from my normal size was huge. and the arms are ridiculously huge in proportion to the rest of the jacket. not sure what kind of creature this was designed for...",1

Im 5'5 and weigh about 148 38 c cup I ordered it in med. but it was just to snug,so now I'm back for a large,I like things not so tight. For the price you can't go wrong! But I would be careful when washing it ,so ill be hand washing this one. Great for nights out in vegas!",5

It has a lining underneath ..which I love bc most dresses are see-through these days and this one isn't. Love Love Love. Also, it arrived earlier than expected! Also, it is short and it' not fitted but I like that and was expecting that.",5
397615,"shipping was like any item like within a week which was good. however, when i use them in dance class, i slip and fall with them because the bottom of it won't ""grip"" as other hip-hop shoes.

Not as comfortable as some other heels I have in that aspect but hoping I just need to break them in a bit.  Also, shoes not as black as they appear in photo.",4
3018,"This bag is durable, and big enough for books, and electronic items (cameras, chargers, extra batteries, and more). It fits perfectly around you when worn over your shoulder.

494201,"Super cute, I ordered the Go To Hell Unicorn sweater (not the floral one pictured) and it fit perfectly and is adorable! The sleeves are a tad short but it doesn't bother me. Took a bit to get here (approximately 2-3 weeks) but that was to be expected. Thanks again!",5
478275,"This suit is adorable.  I was very impressed when I pulled it out of the packaging.  The color is pretty and the hardware is sturdy.  I wish it would've worked, but after nursing two kids I need a more supportive (aka push up/underwire) top.  If you can identify, I wouldn't get this suit.  I highly recommend it otherwise. Very impressed for the price.",4
696206,"The dress color is a little off. Its much brighter than seen in the picture. I ordered it in red. when it arrived it was very badly wrinkled, but I expected it to be. What I didn't expect was that the material would seem so cheap. I don't think it would be destroyed in the wash or anything, its just a disappointment. I bought it for a costume for Halloween, but had hoped to be able to wear it for other occasions. With its quality of fabric I think I might just return it though.",1
870785,I used this mans shirt for hiking and it was great! I washed it and it dried within 2 (hours'line dried) it holds no odors! T shirt was big enough to surround back pack needing extra room in the blouse area for air flow!  Works great smells okay after hours of body sweat and Odor! Pilling occurs on all wool so some is expected when you wear a pack. Instructions sent by email on care were greatly appreciated!,5
639937,"I should have known to order the XL.  I normally take a US Large.  This is an ""Asian Large"", and fits a bit more snug than the typical US Large, but not by much.  Will be interesting to see if it shrinks much as it is washed.  If it shrinks, it might be hard to tuck it in, but being a summer shirt that's not all bad.  BTW the shoulders on the tan version I received are not plaid.  Just plain tan.  Looks better I think.",5
232218,"The forms fit as expected in some bras and are a little bit big in others. It depends on the type of bra you are wearing.

 Not too heavy.

 Smells go away after awhile out of the plastic box it came in.

339592,So after seeing mixed reviews on these earrings...I figured I would try my luck and order. I got snake eyes. The earrings are really hard to put in. I got one in after fighting and trying for 30 MINUTES! Maybe if you didn't have to screw them in it would be easier....a push in would have been awesome. They came in pairs so that's one highlight. Came in a timely manner which is anothe plus. I really wanted to love these but I can't.,1
574040,"I saw this on an add on FB and loved it, so I ended up finding it here, on Amazon, cheaper. Should have been my first clue that it's a cheap knock-off. I bought a large, but it fit like a small. Definitely not as long as the picture or loose. Don't waste your time and money.",1
747564,"For one, they run very small, i am a size 8 jeans and I order an extra large, it fit but very tightly. So unless you have no butt, don't order these. Second reason these are horrible, the clasp things in the straps come in a bag so you have to figure out how to put them on yourself. And third of all the buttons on both sides have no holes open to button them with which makes no sense. You would have to cut them open if you want to button the sides. Stupid",1
210813,"I have been searching for a pair of leggings that are comfy, opaque, flattering, AND cheap... and these fit the bill!

I love these for running, yoga, stretching, or running errands around town. The fit is great and they move with me. The material is not super thick, so overheating is not an issue.

I am 5'8"" and about 133lbs, and size Small fit perfectly.",5
689012,"I just fell in love with the Harem pants product.
I find them very comfy if fitted properly. My personal feelings are with this product is it can be worn as a casual outfit and with a few changes can also use it for a night out on the town! Fun and comfortable,made well. I also found all these products to be very easy to clean.
Throw into the washing machine and hang to dry, soooo easy !",5
446872,Ordered for a friend last minute (3days prior to wedding) when the band she had picked out for her husband to be failed to arrive on time. It's a great quality band and arrived a day early! Fits great! The only thing is it was thinner (width) than we had anticipated. He loved it anyway!,4
492624,"I bought this for my Grell Sutcliff cosplay and these glasses are great! For about $5 these are really good. They are a little flimsy so I would be careful putting them on and taking them off. They came in a plastic clear case, there was no cracks, dents or skratchs on the case or glasses. and they came early which was nice. Overall great glasses",5
632480,"The material is thin and stretchy. It is comfy, but there's not much support. Depending on your shape they can ride up or down through the day. Zero erection containment ability. They've held up through several washings with no damage or fade. These are just thin underwear, not compression shorts.",3
88869,"I bought these for Softball...didn't know what to expect. I've never owned a pair of compression shorts. I'm not entirely sure what the benefit is, but I definitely feel ""compressed"" and more together when I go to play organized sports. They also aid in keeping my thigh braces in place a bit better than cotton boxers.

If they had a front flap opening for my junk, I'd consider buying some for daily use...they are that comfortable. Definitely going to buy another pair for next season.",5
266786,"It's a lot larger than I suspected it to be, as I am a size 18 and the measurements claimed that it would fit UP TO an 18. I expected it to be tight, but when I tried it on, I was absolutely swimming in it. Ah well, I still adore it regardless.",4
489964,"I like the jacket. It is good for the price and the size does run a bit small but i took that into consideration and ordered two sizes larger than I normally ware and it fit fine. The fabric is not ""high quality"" but what do you expect from a $30-40 jacket?",4
859445,"You can see through this fabric it is so thin. ""Linen"" is heavier and this is advertised as linen. More like gauze. As is the case with most of the Asian made dresses the arms are too small in proportion to the rest of the dress, which does fit okay.",2
860087,So I'm about 5'9 135 pounds and I wear mediums in most dresses. This was not a dress on me. Unfortunately it was just a shirt with a belt and not even a nice belt. If I would have attempted to wear this as a dress probably would have a lot of explaining to do as to why I considered it appropriate for my childs Easter egg hunt. Thanks but no thanks.,1
795455,"Nice quality shirt but the size runs at least 2 sizes too small.  I ordered a 2x for my husband and he couldn't even begin to close it much less button it. He has many Hawaiian shirts and most fit fine in just an XL.  Maybe this was just a mislabeled run, but it's definitely much smaller than a 2XL. Unfortunately I will be returning it.",3
757829,"This shirt is a nice color. It's is a little thin but not so much so that you need an undershirt. It isn't as long in the back as I would like, and is actually longer in front. It's a fun design and I get compliments when I wear it. I ordered Med and should have gotten a Sm. I'm 5'5"" and 130lb. Over all, it's a nice shirt for the price!",3
219367,"These were huge. They skipped right off my two year old's hands, after struggling to get them on. They are large enough to fit my adult hands, and they're average for a woman. There's no 'cincher' around the wrist to adjust, to help keep them on..They became such a pain I just put my gloves on my son and threw these in the truck. Returned.",1
874720,"This swim suit was not long enough. I originally wear a XL and I ordered a 3XL (used their size chart provided). It fit around the waist but when I put my legs in and pulled it up it didn't even cover any of my boobs! If they fixed this issue I would love to order the suit again, but I had to return it. Sadly I don't even have a long torso and I'm only 5'4.",1
142343,"This dress took a little while but it was worth the wait. I am a large girl US size 14-16 5'-10' and I took the chance on this dress because I could tell the fabric  stretches very well. If you are larger than this, do not take that chance or the fabric will stretch too much and make the colors look washed out. The colors are vibrant and interesting. I will buy other styles in this dress.",5
441600,"Really nice ring.  I am a 12.5 and the fit does seem to be right for 12.5. If you are worried about the sizing, not everyone is the same, go to multiple places to have your ring sized and take the average.  That always seems to work.  Its very smooth and shinny.  I think it looks better in person then in the picture.",5
798219,"Beautiful style but hangs pretty loosely in the waist even for a style that is meant to be loose-fitting.  I'm 5'7"" and ~160 lbs with a long torso, wide shoulders (15""), and long arms (I like sleeves to be 24""). I usually wear U.S. size 12 in tops, and I ordered size large.  The sleeves were too short for me.",3
631003,"These pants are perfect! Bright purple, very stretchy to comfortably fit my body and still make me look good. The material is comfortable and I love the fit, but the pockets are nearly useless! If you're looking to keep your smart phone in your back pocket it will likely fall out. However if you just want comfortable pants that come in a beautiful purple these are for you! They also don't seem to shrink much if any in the dryer, that was a pleasant surprise.",5
79591,"We purchased this because the description stated it was a mock turtleneck. The fabric was a very cheap dri-weave which was comfortable enough for wearing in hot weather, but it snagged seconds after arrival, and was nothing more than a crew neck t-shirt. If it had been intended for anything other than a Halloween costume, we would have returned it. As it is, it became a disposable garment that could only be worn for the party, then tossed.",2
62284,This product is wonderful!! The support is perfect. I began wearing it on day 4 post c-section (1st day home) and was able to move much more easily!!! My only grievance is its one more layer of clothing during a Georgia summer which can't be helped :) definitely recommending to all of my pregnant friends!!!!,5
141704,I really like this bag. It's large enough that I can fit a 10 inch tablet plus all my regular purse items. The color is true to the pictures. My only complaint is the clasps used to connect the long strap are made of really cheap painted plastic. I don't forsee it holding up well due to that.,4
510793,This was not a good purchase. The umbrella cloth was connected to caps that sat in the ends of the ribs but was not glued or attached in any other way. There wasn't enough friction to keep the end caps in place so every time you closed it the fabric would come loose from the ribs.,1
804358,"I've had one before, excellent quality, perfect for what I needed. The color of this one is actually prettier than it looks online. I needed a bright happy color because the inside of handbags and backpacks is usually dark, and then you cannot find anything. This one is just right!
Thank you!",5
507707,"Nice socks. I needed thin socks for my kinda dressy shoes and these are good. They are true to size as you normally would wear. After washing and wearing a pair all day they stayed up good. It was warm that day and the socks didn't sweat my feet.  The colors match the pic.  I'm picky about my shoes and socks. I would purchase these again. I'll probably order other colors in awhile.
They were delivered quickly.",5
391823,runs very small.  I usually take a Large or !X and i ordered this in largeXX which should be 2X  It is so small and tight that their must be a mistake.  No paper work arrived with it and no return label.  I'm very very unhappy with this gown and very upset that it arrived without paper work to replace it with a bigger size.  Now I am stuck with it!  I will not order from this seller again.,2
838841,"These slippers are amazing!! I don't like going anywhere barefoot, so these are great for around the house. They offer a lot of support. The foam pad of the sole is the thickest I've found of ANY slippers... And I've tried A LOT! I will definitely buy more of these. Comfortable and the cutest!",5
168072,"I normally buy this brand at TJ Maxx or Marshalls, I'm glad I can find it on Amazon too. They are so comfy; perfect for yoga or just hanging out around the house. The pink isn't quite as neon as it looks in the picture, but I like the actual color better.",5
128377,I am short and only 4'10 118 lbs and this fits perfect with another hoodie underneath for added warmth.  It's not too thin and great quality.  I got this right before the rain! I love this jacket and I can adjust the sleeves with the Velcro and they have elastic built in.,5
435674,"I got all colors of the watches from this company, the base is also in the same color as the straps , the rubber is much more elastic as by other brands , the main base is plastic with stainless steel from inside , the price was great before that why I got all colors , working just fine , great mirror on the hand when you need it to fix your make-up or to spy on your friends behind you LOL",5
880009,I hate it. but I guess for the price I deserve what I got. cheap is always expensive. I bough an XL and it fits like a medium. will give it to my niece's. will not purchase from this company again. I bought thinking it will be lose and very casual to wear with jeans or leggings. but its way toooooo tight.,1
12786,"Fits and feels amazing, I immediately order another for my boots as my boots were my favorite and have had them 15 years but the inside had broken down. I have refused to throw the boots away just because everything else is fine with them.  Other insoles moved around and just didn't work but then these Powerstep Pinnicale have made it a new boot.",5
331140,"Gloves were super warm and are truly waterproof.  I spent over 7 hours shoveling through the blizzard and my hands were never compromised.  The extended collar on the gloves also prevented wind from shooting down into my glove.  I recommend these gloves to anyone living in the upper midwest or northeast areas of the country.  Oh, and Amazon delivered them the same day in which I ordered them...great service.",5
137089,Took other reviewers advice and went up half size and it was too large. I thought this was a more sock-like fit but it had a tongue that came up high on my ankle not at all sock like. Nice looking and very light weight with a rounded square toe that left plenty of room front foot and toes. These just weren't what I was looking for.,3
319001,"Product came earlier than expected so that was a plus! Phone case is too big for my brother's phone, but that's my fault as I don't own an iphone and wasn't aware of differences between iphone6 and iphone6 plus. Gave it to a friend and he loves it! works well as a phone protector, so your phone can look stylish and be safe at the same time.",5

260323,"I ordered 2,both small and I'm a c cup. They fit nice and the material was not really cheap and the back was really nice but the padding moves around a bit too much, I would rather the padding be either bigger so it isn't too noticeable when it shifts or if it was attached or even sewed into the bralette. But overall, it was comfy and cute! I even bought an extra pair since they're really comfy for the price",4
491576,"Perfect for the 13 year old girlfriend my 13 year old son bought this for! It's for her birthday and came in a little gift box and even has a little satin bag she can use for carrying her makeup and stuff like a little purse..only complaint is the color he picked was red and this came in more of a pink, but I think she will be happy either way.",5

421354,"I like the appearance of this watch, although it is somewhat large and thick for a swatch. I noticed some reviewers mention that the ticking sound is louder than most watches, and I thought it was a weird comment (how could it matter enough to mention it in a comment?). LISTEN. It's way too loud. I find myself taking it off and trying to muffle the noise while watching TV, or turning it away from me while working at my desk. I'm undecided as to whether I should return it because of this. It's incredibly distracting once you notice it.",3
699605,"These are the best t-shirts I have ever purchased! They are so soft and comfy but not too form fitting or loose. They hang just the way I want them too. After reading other reviews I decided to order two sizes up from what I normally would, which was perfect for me. They aren't see through and are the perfect basic to wear with everything. I highly recommend!",5
306910,It fit my son a tiny bit too small. He's 17 months and in the 2% for weight so he's already pretty small for his age. I bought the 18-24 month size and one of the buttons came coming undone. I'm giving it 4 stars because I liked the quality and he looked adorable in the outfit,4
428914,Absolutely love these boots. Sexy combination of boot and peek-a-boo. Always getting complements. They fit true to size. Snug but perfect fit around calves. Only complaint I have are the laces up the back because they are extremely uncomfortable at the back of the ankle. I had to use a clear pad usually used to cushion the ball of my foot when wearing high heels between laces and ankle where as a flap of the boot material here would have prevented this problem. Cause cushion is clear it isn't noticeable.,4
244963,"It seems to run a little short in the torso,  I thought it was supposed to be lined, but found it only had lining in the front but not in the back.  I have found that its always in the back area covering your bottom that the lining is necessary as the fabric wears and fades from the sun that is where it gets the thinnest and most seethrough.  Lining can help prevent embarrassing moments.",3
575184,"I ordered two sizes bigger than I usually wear, and it was still super tiny. Looks nothing like the style in the picture, more like it could be a tight fitted crop top for working at sea world. Because it ships from China returning this product costs more than the item.",1

Wouldn't use for snow or rainy conditions (as they are not waterproof) but certainly great for playground or even ice skating or the outdoor activities.",5
738221,"These pants were very odd.  No tag to determine front or back or size.  They were way too small, I have ordered many pants like this in the same size and I used the sizing guide.  Last complaint, even though they are supposed to be new, there was a stain on the front.",2
665909,It is a decent material with good stretch. I did have to return tho. Just wasn't what I was looking for in regards to that's event I was needing it for. It did fit good tho and would work on most body types. Maybe with a tank under it. Lil low cut. Ha. Thanks.,4
483367,"This a very comfortable belt.  - It is easy to put on and buckle up. - The width is perfect for me.-  I like the belt very well overall.

The colors while very bright and bold upon arrival faded extremely fast, after the one accidental drying the colors appear to be as though they've been washed and dryer for years and years.
They are comfortable.
They are see-through, nice for around the house as long as you're around people comfortable seeing your package in it's entirety.
Very affordable is definitely the saving grace with these.",3

They were a excellent match even though the necklace does not have butterflies it does have some finely executed flowers and bows. The necklace rest high on the neck although there is sufficient amounts of necklace to extend it if required. It is a very pretty piece of jewelry the photo does not really do it justice. It is also heavier than it looks it has plenty of silver in it. On the whole and excellent purchase well worth the money,5

The merchant was a fast shipper, I had no problems with the transaction at all, however instead of dealing with the hassle of returning them, I just gave them to goodwill.",1
839386,"DO NOT ORDER. Item is not as pictured, it has white buttons instead of silver making it not as cute as pictured. It is also very short, I ordered a size up and it was still too short. I had issues with the company when I tried to return as well",1
81656,This is exactly what I was looking for.  It's a little larger than it appears inside.  Plenty of room for what I need.  The case is rigid but may soften after some use but it's good the way it is.  It opens wide and stays open.  Room enough to pack everything you need when you travel.  I was trying to decide between this one and the larger version.  I glad I chose this one.  The size is just right for me.,5
565225,"Cheap material, and fell apart piece by piece every time they were worn or washed...then were not tight on me, so this is not what I meant by somewhat small... but instead they were an extremely awkward and UGLY length! Never again will I buy anything like this from these particular sellers! NEVER!",2
556286,"this is by far the WORST possible item i have ever bought, it looks cheap., its not leather, it fits way to small and i bought a biggert size I WILL NEEEEEVER BUY from this seller EVER again, so disappointed I wasted my money. HOOORIBLE jcket, it looks platic. i THRU IT to the GARBAGE",1
408844,"Very pleased with my watch.  The dial is a more attractive, darker red, than the photos.  Its very clear, and the hands light up at night.  Watch is easy to adjust and looks well made and durable.  Strap is OK, but not as attractive as the rest of the watch.  I have a very small wrist and the top notch on the strap is just the right fit, so I would expect this to fit any adult wrist.  Discount and price made this a very good buy.",5
860578,Where do I even begin?! Omg I love this product it was so comfortable and got so many compliments while wearing it from all cultures definitely a statement piece and gave me so much confidence while wearing I'm happy the fabric is the way it is due to normally dashiki attire is stiff this is the total opposite just ordered more I put a black body cotton dress underneath to help with it being see threw,5
122040,"Just got mine in the mail...it sucks. Not what I expected, bottom lace on back sticks out, and it's too big on me. I Even have a huge butt and it still does not fit. I was so unhappy with the bottoms I didn't even bother with trying the top on.",1
61707,"This is a waste of money. Did nothing helpful to reduce the tummy and the part that suppose to protect the incision was not near the incision at all it was way above for a 5'6"" person. I bought 2 and regretted it because only one was used for a few times. The material rolls down too much it was so  uncomfortable.",1
436111,"These earrings are beautiful and a great size, only thing is that the fish hook where the silicone ear stopper was placed made that area lose the gold finish. I did not contact the seller on this, but would recommend to seller not to put these silicone ear stoppers until earrings are ship. The earrings  are excellent and pricing excellent as well. They look exactly like a high designer A. Bittar earrings, but without the high priced tag. Would purchase more from this seller. Totally please with the seller and his product.",4
332710,"I purchased this knowing it ran small so ordered XL. I am little curvy at 145lbs 5'2. Ordered for beach cover up since other reviews said it was super short hence it is a mini-dress. Lace looks good, dress is more off white than white, don't quite like the balls that hang on dress but it works. I love this and it was worth the price I paid!",3
880841,"The fabric felt good and the shorts are light weight. But my son was not able to wear them because they are so small he could not get them on.
I did receive these shorts at a discount in return for my honest review but the opinions I expressed are solely my own.",3
445099,"At first when I purchased this item for my bridesmaid, I was a little nervous. I wanted to get this because this was her birthstone and I was getting all of the girls their birthstones, but honestly, I thought this one would be the least attractive of the bunch; I was wrong. This stone is prettier in person. It's shiny and looks wonderful. Although it's one-sided (the stone doesn't show in the back) the necklace can be worn without that part being seen because it's well-balanced and doesn't flip backward. A very pretty necklace that exceeded my expectations.",5
76512,"My husband adores this hat.  It fits well over his head and ears so that the wind doesn't come whistling in.  I wish the style was a bit sleeker, more like a Kangol cap, but perhaps the fact that the earflaps need to tuck in dictates that.  I did follow the advice of other reviewers and order a size up, and am glad I did.",4
629276,"Shipping was fast! the packaging was very pretty (girl). There was a pouch, glass cleaner, key chain with screw for repair. Just beautiful. I would have like the handles of the glasses to have been dipped in more gold as it seemed as though it was a very light gold. But hey they were only $12 so I still give them 5 because the packaging and shipping was fantastic. I will be ordering again.",5
139245,"I ordered this in L first, assuming it was asian sizing, but it was too large, so I donated it and ordered S. The first shirt was nice, vivid colors, decent material. The second I got was just junk! Tissue like material, the color is off, dirty white and muted blue and red. It was all wrinkled! This is my worst purchase from Amazon.",1
105958,Read the review before you buy it. They say the size is small (they even said so on the label) and yet it is oversized for me. I'm the same size as the model (she is 5ft'3 apparently) and yet the dress extend almost all the way to my knee. The material isn't quality at all.,1
83403,"The best purchase I have ever made for an anti-glare day time driving.  They are great in the car and great for riding the motorcycle!  Oh, and they are very rugged.  Unlike others I have purchase from a TV advertisement I have dropped these several times and not one time did the frames or glasses break!",5
848289,"I LOVE the cut and design of this dress, but it just didn't fit. (I was pretty devastated. I still mourn what could have been.) I'm generally a size 12 - 14 with a 36DDD chest- the Large baaaaarely zipped and featured a Boobpocalypse up front, and the XL flared out a lot right beneath the breasts and made my stomach look really poochy.

I think it's a great dress, it's just not the cut for my body.",3
35434,"I bought these for my wife, she's not thrilled with them they do work and she can see fine and even though I bought them last week I think she's now down to one parent left and I'll have to order another dozen, that's what they're great for wear them and throw them away so cheap",5
32629,"Cheaply made, The V of the thong is razor sharp and made a slice between my toes! Who knew you could be injured by a pair of plastic flip flops. A full size too short, and made for very thin feet as it's impossible to squeeze a normal foot under the straps.  I do not recommend these for noamal people. And they weren't cheap!",2
80656,"They said they would send me bigger ones if I sent these ones back. However I would have to pay shipping and I have no time for any of that. I ended up keeping them but they don't even fit my wife. She's going to find a friend that can use them.

Fix your sizing. They were ordered 1 size larger than what she wears and they were still too small",2
872345,This underwear feels great and has plenty of air circulation because of the material it is made with. It is not made with cotton. More of an elastic material. The only reason I gave 4 stars is that you have to get two sizes bigger than your usual size. I'm usually a large and has to get 2XL for it to fit. Other than that great underwear!,4
23086,"This stretcher works very well.  I'm giving five stars even though there are two things I wish they would improve:
1)add a heel brace that would keep the thing from sliding away from the toe box as you tighten it
2)throw in a couple more of the black plastic pressure points, and make a larger one as well",5
120305,"We used this all summer for our toddler. We went on vacation and we use this on all pools with no accidents. However, we were also really aware of the ""schedule"". So, if you think you kid is going to urinate in the pool this will not be sufficient so use a diaper designed for pools too.

Otherwise it is great to prevent surprises floating around..... wow that's a picture right there.

Quality, etc is great. Washes well and it looks brand new after 3 months of intense pool and sun exposure.",5
425554,Is what these slippers are.  I shall soon be able to test them in 20 below cold.  I've been told that's what's coming soon.  They won't weigh the foot down and they don't keep slipping off as my other slippers do.  When I can I'll order another pair.,5
67850,"Loving the sleek style and beautiful leather. I was really happy it did not have zipper straps - these are fantastic, so comfortable that I can wear with tank tops. And, huge bonus when my iPone 6+ fit easily in the secure outside zipper.  Very grateful to find a such a beautifully designed bag that lets me travel hands free.",5
554989,"So I like this coat a lot, it's really warm and well sewn.  The thing is, it fits a little weird.  I'm 5'7"", 150lbs. and the sleeves were almost too short for me. I could make it work though.  But the shoulders and chest are really snug and the torso is very loose and the buttons seem loosely attached.  I really want to keep it, but I think based on the tightness in the shoulders and shortness in the sleeves I'll have to return it.",4
152024,"The shirt is not shaped like it is in the pictures. It is much more tailored and has sleeves that are almost fitted and cuffed. It does not hang off the shoulder or as low in the back. I like the color, but material feels cheap and poorly made. It would cost more to return it at this point. I will not likely order from Allegra K again. I have ordered a couple items in the past, but they are hit and miss and cost more to return, so you are stuck if you are unhappy.",2
863132,"I like the shirt, as a 3X I expected it to be loose as a goose but not that was not the case, I'll have to lose some weight before I get into this one. Overall I'm going to keep it because it is a pretty cool shirt now I just need to head over to the Y and get back in shape.",3
737002,"Beautiful, warm, convenient! Great for throwing on at home just to watch TV or snuggle with a good book. And, it's great to throw on over whatever you're wearing for unexpected trips out of the house! (No one can see what you're really wearing under it!).  Love it! Have one in every color! Great value for the price!",5
426978,"The panties have a nice feel and stretch.  Unfortunately, if you have any kind of butt - they crack crawl which is really annoying.  I am a size 10 and I ordered the large.  They would not stay in place over my backside and insisted in migrating to undesirable places.  Probably fine if you are very small.  The shipping was very prompt however.",2
877175,"This is a really pretty bright red in color. The sizing is right on point. I ordered a large, usually I have an issue with the chest fitting and then the panties too big or vice versa - Not with this set however. It is a silky smooth feeling fabric. Very flattering when I put it on. Both my husband and myself liked how it looked. Very pretty lace design. I purchased this product at a discounted price for my honest review.",5
157054,"We bought this for my son's 6th birthday.  We held it until his birthday.  He wore it ONE (partial) day and the front cover fell off and broke the second hand off. Go figure, it is ONE friggin' day past the Amazon return period.  So much for planning in advance for the present.  THIS WATCH IS A COMPLETE PIECE OF JUNK.  It's too bad because he was really excited to wear his new Ninja Turtle watch.",1
443352,"I really love this little (not THAT little) ring. I.ve had it on the whole two months I've had it. In the shower, everywhere...parties - it really does go with whatever you're wearing, casual or cocktail party type ring.
I am SO GLAD I bought it. It's the Best thing I've ever bought for myself, and I could actually afford it. Too bad more things aren't like that!",5
358285,"Love these mittens for my little guy. The newborn mittens we got as gifts would not stay on his little hands, and he was constantly scratching his face (sometimes drawing blood!). We now have several pairs of these mittens to keep his face scratch free. They don't fall off and they wash and wear well. Definitely a good buy.",5
2078,"Bought this to put away for Christmas after researching a bunch and previously ordering another one I had to return due to it being so cheaply made.  Looks good, speaker quality seems fine, sturdy visor.  Plastic a little thinner than I thought with a seam with clips running down the middle of the helmet.  I guess if it were heavier plastic it would be just that, heavy.  Will update after Christmas if does not hold up.",4
532332,"The buckle is constructed well, and the colors are what was expected.  Wearing it has the added bonus of having people knowing that the symbol is somehow familiar, but just can't place it.  I wore it for a week in my 7th grade class, and several students offered guess after guess.  I would give this five stars if it was 90% or so of its size; it's wearable, but it's just a *wee* bit bigger than I'd like.",4
85386,I loved this shirt because it was exactly what I was expecting!  I wear it as shown in the picture and love it. I have received compliments on it also!! When worn this way the pockets are little awkward but not enough to bother me. Its baggy and very comfortable. As another reviewer said it is perfect for those days you feel bigger or just don't feel good about the way look. I just LOVE IT!!!,5
777306,"While the fit is slightly small it is well made and comfortable, easy to alter and perfect for a night out.

Multiple options for how to create new looks and different dresses. One dress ordered and 5 options to create 5 dresses received instead! ;)
This would be great in multiple colors as well!

Recd at a discount to review.",4
383580,Love the top! Super cute! It doesn't drape off my shoulder like in the picture. (She must be a size 00. I wear a small generally.) The neck just isn't cut as large as that. I still love the feel of the blouse and the flow of the fabric. Was perfect for the summer!,4
258166,"My daughter has had these for two weeks so far and she loves them. She wears a size 5 so I hesitantly purchased a 5 and they fit great. She is so proud of being able to put them on easily herself and they fit great. Pattern is great, quality is nice. You only notice the smell of the rubber if you hold them to your face. Great buy.",5
478269,"Beautiful pair of earrings -- I just wished it was a little daintier, they were actually quite large - about half an inch square (didn't look carefully at the pic so I didn't expect it). They have quite some weight to it and the crystals don't look cheap. Overall, I still like it -- I just wish they'd make a smaller, daintier pair.",4
435536,"Masks look nice, but worse than expected. Both strings fell right off as soon as I put one against my face. They are attached with a dot of hot glue, which is not enough to support the weight. I will have to tie stretchy strings to them in order to use.",3
620007,Got this as a gift for a senior lady and she just LOVES it!  Took off a star because I had to sew some gauze into two places inside the band to keep it off her eyebrows.  Can't guess how it will hold up but it is one jazzy hat!,4
300297,"Love this ring.  My husband & i both got one...So comfortable like I'm not even wearing.
 I am active, hard working raised farm girl, crossfit, work with horses, kids, & tackle every challenge.  Perfect for my no fuss lifestyle.
Its cute..sizing method was very accurate & seafoam and snow white is exactly the color pictured.  Love it...will order another one soon.",5
513969,"I was VERY disappointed with how large the photo made the necklace and earrings look!  In person the ""A"" symbol is soooo small! The size of one single vegetable pea! I couldn't believe it! You literally have to be right at my ear and neck to tell that it is an ""A"" symbol but I guess I should have paid more attention to the dimensions and measurements of the necklace and earrings before purchasing it. Do not be fooled by the photo! This jewelry set is VERY small!

(Retta is my nickname btw, my first name begins with an ""A"")",1
386049,"The mittens are nice and soft, and the velcro strap isn't scratching- I ordered these and then read the reviews, seeing the review and picture of the scratch.  Figured I could just return if I didn't like them.  This wasn't the case with the mittens I got.  I think the maker took the comment and reacted with a change, because I have a hard time seeing how the mittens I got could cause such a scratch.",5
252556,"Very cute bag - described elsewhere as a cat face which seems accurate. Be aware that the materials used are not high end. There is a very strong chemical smell as the materials out-gas. Once that stops after a few days, I'll be able to use the bag. Style is very cute and the bag is a convenient size but be aware of petro-chemical smells if you are sensitive.",3
663248,"I love it because it's Star Wars but it's very thin. It's not really much of a bit because of how thin the material is. And it's definitely not worth over the $14 I paid for it plus the shipping, but then again, because we are Star Wars nerds, we love it.",3
220521,"I only have 2 beanies and I thought that when winter comes, I'd go and have a selection of beanies so that I wouldn't feel like wearing the same ones I have. Red and Ivory look great. I even look for those that are deep enough to wear a satin bonnet or silk scarf underneath. I keep my ends protected from the dry winter air, falling snow, and wind during the months where it gets cold both day and night.",5
604884,"I love these little things. Don't use them for nails. Mainly for crafts. They have a variety of sizes of small ball shaped ends. Great for wax and clay and I guess one could use them for painting dots on stuff. Think that's how they are intended to be used. Plus, and it is a big plus, if I'm bored I can twirl them and contemplate the spirals. Great all round entertainment for under $2.00.",5
126119,I thought a clear plastic bag would be of low quality and not hold up to the weight of all my nursing books that I carry to the hospital.  I was wrong.  this bag is durable and is holding up perfectly to the wear and tear of nursing school.,5
390458,Great protectors. Bought this for girlfriend who's had to go to many weddings and she says they work perfectly without letting her sink into any grass at all or breaking a heel. She's gone through numerous shoes because of this in the past. Would highly recommend to any girl who plans on wearing heels on the grass!,5
269041,"Just got this bag today. I really like it tbh! It's not as bad as I thought it would be. Of course, I prefer it without the shoulder straps so it's good that it's able to put both ways. I'm a college student and I put my five star notebook and folders even some textbooks and it fits well! Also love the color it's not too shabby!  although it sucks that the books kinda bend a bit since they can't be put straight up but other than that, I love it! Thanks! Also it's spacious ",4
31884,I have to say they are ok.  Simply because they are too big.  Way too big.  However they are made very well and I was please to see they were on the thicker side of fleece.  I donated mine to a homeless shelter but would of worn them and kept them had I gotten the correct size.  Thinking that was part of the problem although I do think sizing is generous.  Had they fit I would of 5 starred this item but in all fairness I could not fully review the item.,3
842640,I was skeptical about sizing but ordered L because I am a 32DD and it fit. The bottom piece is adjustable at the sides so that was ok. I probably could have fit comfortably in the M as well. Good quality bikini. Good padding in the bra and good fabric. I'll recommend.,4
831539,"Cute sheer fabric and fit me well but the pocket, that should have been over my left breast, was very low and threw off everything about the shirt. Even if I had very large breasts the pocket still would have sat awkwardly. Super disappointed but it was so cheaply priced that it wasn't worth returning because it would have cost me twice what I paid to return it.",2
609810,"The picture of this swimsuit cover-up misrepresented it's actual length and fit.  I'm 5'2"" and this item fits like a blouse; just below my waist and would not cover the bottom of a swimsuit.  In addition, it is extreme thin and sheer.  If you're looking for a true swimsuit cover- up skip this item!",1
356001,I ordered this in a 4t bc that is our normal size. It fits exactly as it should. The quality is very nice. It is very well made. I like how thick the fabric is. I would definitely purchase more of these for my son! He loves the cars on the shirt. The wait was worth it. I received this for a discount in exchange for my honest review.,5
253823,"The zipper was starting to pull away from the wallet that I received, rather than send back I just glued it and I'm going to hope for the best. I was surprised it was sent out like that.

353606,"You will have to reshape the hat as it comes in an envelope and it is all flattened out.  Due to its construction (wires and organza), you can reshape easily to your head.  It also has a band inside that can be adjusted to fit your head better.  It's a fun hat and will also be used for my semi-annual tea parties.",5
876159,"I was not completely satisfied with my initial sunglasses, however the outstanding customer service team took extra measures to make sure I would be completely happy with my next pair. I now have the gold framed aviators with blue lens. It's a little large for my face, however I really like the color contrast and also that I know I will get complete coverage from sun in my eyes. I love the case they come with. I think with a great company who cares about their customers, you are bound to be satisfied.",4
854363,"It does the job but I don't like how big my phone looks with it... plus I don't feel it protects it as much as a regular case. I guess it is okay for special occasions, but I find it to be a pain to put it on and off so I usually don't use it :(",3
551547,Super cute bikini.  I ordered the white and it would be see through if not for the Pads. I ordered a small and the top is a little big (I'm a C cup) I probably could have gotten away with the extra small.  The strings on it are pretty long and I will have to cut them.  Overall a good buy I'd recommend going down a size. It's a scrunch bottom so your going to hang out a bit so just keep that in mind.,4
761602,"I bought this for my Pebble Time Round smartwatch.  It looks great.  I have a very small wrist and it fit.  My husband was easily able to attach the straps without any special tools.  The leather and stitching appear to be good quality.  I saw someone mentioned the band was stiff, which it was, but I don't see how that is a problem.  I wore it and it has softened up fine.",5
106010,"I ordered an XL, assuming that it was going to run small (I'm normally M-L) but when it came the dress went below my knees! I attempted to hem it, but ended up hemming it too short to be a dress, so in the end, it turned out to be a really cute sweater!!! Just be careful what size you choose !",4
259749,Itm arived very timely!  Fits great but I am an odd build! I am very broad shouldered 5'2 140lbs. It is only recieving  a three star as it is so completely a different color than stated I ordered a deep blue stretching it a purple and recieved flourescent pink!  I will not wear this at all! they should have contacted! me!  Love style and Quality is ok for price!  but will attempt return or exchange was going to request red but think i would get flourescent orange! LoL,3
501709,"I love this suit and it was really inexpensive, but it is completely unlined.  I discovered that I can wear a light sports bra under it without looking too strange since the back of the swimsuit is kind of high.  Otherwise it would be completely useless for me.",4
669587,"This is the second bag I've purchased from Derek Alexander. The quality of the leather is awesome! There are so many card slots and many many compartments.

107634,I actually got these for my grandson who has a pair he wants to wear everywhere and they were becoming a little ratty looking.  Gave his new shoes to him on Friday and he's been wearing them ever since.  I also got him a navy pair in the next size so that he'll have a pair when he outgrows these or wears them out first.,5
348820,"I love the urn it is beautiful.  It is heavy and the chain is okay weight and quality.  the writing could be a little larger making it easier to read.  It is Beautiful overall. I was sad to realize it did not come with a funnel, so i am looking for one to fill it with Dad's ashes.  It is worth the money, just realize it does not have a funnel.",4
366901,"Love the look. I was expecting them to be ill fitting and uncomfortable, more of a gag really. They more than exceeded my expectations. Arrived 2 weeks early. Form fit , and stretchy enough in the front to accommodate. The see-through mesh added a nice touch for my significant other. And they are probably the most comfortable pair of underwear I own (due to the cooling properties of the mesh). Well made too.",5
725001,They look so cute but my daughter could barely wear it as it was to narrow and tight even though i got them in her size. I am not even going to bother returning since it's no free returns or exchanges! I should have checked. Poor quality too. Don't bother.,1

238281,"Decent chains. A few of mine came broken which isn't a huge deal, more of just an annoyance that I have to go and fix brand new chains. Also they are covered in an oily residue that smells really bad so I also have to clean them. Again, not a huge deal, but annoying.",3
79677,"I like these bands. I have a wider one that left a tail with three holes remaining. This one left a tail with one hole remaining, but looks and fits good, so long as you won't wear it over a wetsuit.. The webbing is just the right thickness and varies between the 18mm (slightly thinner) and the 22mm slightly thicker. Others I have purchased from other sources had thinner webbing. The hardware is quality. Good looking and practical.",4
220982,"I wore the BMC Slouchy Beanie today while hitting a couple hundred golf balls and it was perfect. My head stayed nice and warm (45*) and never overheated because it is knitted loosely enough for heat to release with more activity. It held my in-ear headphones in tighter giving them a better fit and sound with the beanie over them. My new favorite winter headgear right now because I can wear in the house, car, or outside and it doesn't bother me temperature wise.",5

The first lighter has the weight and feel of quality you'd expect from a lighter that costs as much as this one. This is a great lighter and would have no complaints had I not purchased the first lighter.,3

I normally hate wearing bathing suits because they never fit me right however this bathing suit I love the way it fits me! Very cute bathing suit! it was hard to pick a color and style because they were all so cute! Material isn't itchy or anything like that really in love with it! Overall this bathing suit I am impressed with the way the bathing suit is made and the different styles the merchant offers! Love the bathsuit!,5

It does have the orange/yellow look will on face which I don't care for, I would prefer hiding eyes or mirror look, but I expected this, so can't complain.",5
373639,"My grandma, a great grandmother (aka""GiGi"") to my newborn daughter, was thrilled to get this for Mother's Day. It's an elegant and clean design that still makes a statement because of the rhinestones. I'm not sure yet as to the quality/durability, and my Grama isn't rough on her keys at all, so I expect this to last for a few years at least. Arrived on time and I was happy with my purchase :)",5
128938,"This top is very very small. Very unhappy with the good looking deceiving picture and the real thing when it arrived. I have decided never to buy this Asian stuff, as these must have been made for very skinny people. I will suggest not to waste your money unless you are very skinny.",1
179846,"These are absolutely adorable!! They are well made and very soft, so they are gentle on baby's head. I love all the different colors, my daughter had a headband for every outfit! I would say they fit her comfortably until about 10 months, and then they started getting snug. The price is also excellent! Very happy with these headbands!",5
610003,"Love these!  I wear them daily and they are comfortable and long, which I love!!!  Good colors to choose from too.  The only thing I would love even more is if I could get them on a 3 pack!  I love to layer one under my other clothes, and they fit really nicely...not tight.",5
230084,Love it because it fits with any outfit! BUT expected it to be a bit bigger from coin part and thicker...With that said coins and rest of necklace are thin all in all... Not too heavy not to light at first look i thought it would smell like those cheap necklaces but it actually doesnt ... I guess its really good for only $3'',4
211238,"While the silver cuff was beautiful, I was a little disappointed because the cute gift box that it came in was ripped in two separate areas. If it was for myself, I wouldn't have minded, but since it was a present for someone else, I was a little embarrassed to give it to them in that condition.",3
17917,"I've had Danner boots in the past for wild land firefighting. I purchased the Acadia as my duty boot as a sheriff's deputy. I was a bit surprised when they arrived as they looked huge, but they fit perfect once I put them on. While they feel a bit heavy compared to some other brands, they are very well built, rugged, and look great under uniform. Comfortable for extended periods of time. Water proof, and hopefully they will be warm through the winter.",5
86983,"I ordered x-small size but I received large instead. Though it arrived on time, it is two sizes larger. Meaning I have to amend it to make it smaller so that I can fit. I just don't get it, can't they differentiate between size XS and L. There is a label for them to read. Unless, the sender doesn't know how to read.",2
556056,"I was leery about quality when I purchased these earrings and the matching necklace. They took a few weeks to arrive, and I had to go to the post office to sign for them, but it was well worth it. This is heavy metal and the pieces are large (the earrings extend about halfway down my neck).  Now I just worry they are too good to be true, as the quality indicates the worth of thi jewelry to be $50-$75.  Maybe they are made out of lead!",5
417004,"We love this company's pj's for our little one, so splurged on their underwear for a holiday gift for her.  These are very high quality underwear and have withstood many washes and accidents.  They fit very well- flatly (do not blouse like some can).  I can't say enough good things about them.",5
787256,"They are not as long as some jeans but I am 5'8"" and they were just fine.  I have washed them and they did NOT shrink.  Wanted to get another pair but received the mfg catalog when I got this pair and they are not in the catalog so may no longer be available.",5
571253,Love this hat- everyone who has seen it has tried to steal it.  The only complaint is that it keeps your head 'too' warm.  If it's not freezing out you will have to take it off before too long.  Perfect for bitter chilly weather.  Great price.,5
650223,"I have an average width size 8 foot but the toe strap seems too close to the toe, like it should be more around the balls of your feet. But maybe that's just the way they fit me. There are better sandals for this price point in my opinion. Returning :(",3
466577,"I purchased a pair of these clogs and within 6 months the shoe started breaking down. The rubber sole separated from the wooden base which ruined the wood. Also, the wood is very soft and easily chipped or cracked. For the price I definitely would not purchase any more clogs form Sven.",1
392187,I ordered this item based on previous reviews. The pictures look good but the actual product is not as seen. The stitching was off and had spots where it was uneven.  The PU leather was ok but the plastic liner inside felt stiff. I returned my item the next day.,1
94910,"Ok first be aware, this is a rather LARGE bauble bib necklace. You may not even want to wear earrings and looks fabulous with either a  plain colored top, blouse, etc. so it can really be part of your outfit. But I love it. Well made so far and I was so excited to find it in silver. Received many compliments on it over the holidays. I would buy another color if I could afford it. Check out bauble necklaces on Polyvore and Pinterest to get ideas what to wear it with to show it off best.",5
819672,I ordered a 0-3 months and was surprised at how large this onesie was. I'm still pleased with it as it is so adorable and eventually the baby will grow into it. I also have a child in the 86th percentile for size so it's not just because I have a small baby. I'd say 0-3 fits like a 3-6.,4
271099,"I am 5'8"" so was very nervous about ordering pants online and this was my first pair I have and I love them they fit amazing. I usually wear a 9 or 10 and some reviews said order a size up I got a 11 and their perfect. they stretch in all the right places (i've had 2 kids lol) and they are long enough for my long legs . would totally recommend these jeans . plus I got then today (Monday) and they were scheduled to be delivered Friday !",5
135043,I got these cause I thought they looked cute. I looked for quite a while trying to find a pair that would have a chance of fit. I'm athletic girl and I have good sized thighs and when I got these they sorta of fit but they are some what small.,3
17720,"The rings are very cute. I personally do not think they look real, but then again you get what you pay for. I don't know if anyone else had this problem, but the CZ stones very easily come off. The first day I wore them, I lost 2 stones on each ring. That was disappointing.",3
631441,"It's about the size of a clutch, so on the large side for a ""wallet"". Add a wrist band and you have a wristlet. I was looking for something that had a slot for my Note 5 and it fits nicely. I like the pattern better in person. Mine has a less bright white on the sides and the front and back are different patterns. I have another Oilily wallet. I appreciate the style and quality of the brand --- attractive, classic and well-made!",5
845785,"I love the way blooming jelly body suits fit. I have a long torso so often body suits do not work for me. The fabric however is very stretchy and really hugs your body.  I'm 5'8"" 145 34DD, I got a medium for reference.  There are snaps at the bottom for ease of getting in and out. Love it. And great for the price.",5
642850,I have this tank top in every color and bought them for my daughter as well. We love them! They do indeed fit a wide range of sizes and are not only great alone but work well under sheer tops and tunics. They can be worn long or ruched for a different look. Great for workout or more formal wear. A staple in my wardrobe!,5
304940,Incredible costume for the cheap price. Kept my child warm in a long sleeve and pants in 35 degree weather for Halloween. The hands and feet are like gloves and slippers that the child can put on. The only downside is sometimes the mane hair can come out in clumps but the costume overall was adorable and of decent quality.,5
270217,"Way too short!  I am 5'1"" 150 lbs.  I bought this dress in a large.  It fit, but barely cleared my butt.  I have a bit of an ass, but not enough to warrant the shortness.  Again, I am 5'1""!  Nothing should be this short for someone my height.  I would only recommend this dress for someone who is under 5' and slender, maybe it would work.",2
738686,"I prefer double flare because they feel more secure at my size (16mm). The pair I recieved just don't look that nice. They're opaque white with none of that translucent milky blue my other opalite pairs have. Theres also weird lines that go across the face. Opalite is man made glass, not a natural stone, so there shouldn't be any ""natural variation."" They're just poor quality. The weight and flare size is good, but I just hoped they'd look better. Switching back to single flare.",2
22320,"This hat is great! My 7 month old never wears hats and he didn't mind it at all! It's soft, very light weight and blocks almost all of the sun. I especially like that it has a draw string you can adjust to fit their heads.. This hat will grow with my son!",5
200968,"I got the largest size, I'm 5'3"" or about 5'2"" 34-27-39 and well, it's a little bit tight. I mean, I can make it work, but definitely get 1 or 2 sizes up, especially if you have curves like me. The top fits fine, but to put on the skirt was a bit of effort. I'm rather petite, but this is definitely designed with really skinny small girls in mind.",4
8288,"I bought these to wear as part of my Halloween costume. I dressed up as a character named Wendy from the ""Where is Waldo"" books to match my boyfriend who dressed up as Waldo and my Pomeranian who was dressed as the dog. I received them in less than a week. They are very comfortable and they looked great on. I haven't worn them for any other occasion just yet but I hope that I""m able to incorporate them in another future Halloween costume.",3
574988,"I loved this skirt, the top had potential, but my boobs hang out. the skirt with a nice black shirt is freaking awesome, and I'm tall. Long skirt hard to find and essential. material nice, but the background color is a cream with a very very faint pink hint going on,  not pure white. that was unexpected, but fine.",5
649688,"It holds a lot.  It is sturdy and I love that I can tuck it inside itself and zip it shut.  I got it for work (I work at a school and ti carries everything I need.  The only problem is it that is's black and my small purse I carry inside is black, so I solved it by buying another and saving the black one for weekends.  I would recommend it to anyone.",5

Due to the reviews I ordered a medium and unfortunately I do not have the cup size to fill this baby. Also even the straps were too long, I had to crisscross the back straps to make it stay on at the shortest length. The bottom fit, but I think a small would fit better.

I do have to say it's a cute and unique bathing suit, especially for the price.",4
863441,"It works... I ordered the glasses and contact travel kit. The glasses case works well with my glasses, and it came with a cloth to clean them. The contact case comes with a built in mirror, the lens holder, solution bottle, tweezers, and contact applicator thingy.

The problems are that the solution bottle is very hard to fill, and I wound up wasting a lot of solution. Also my contact case came dirty and I can't seem to get the stain off.",2
17248,"Love my havaiianas...this is my third pair in 8 years.
Settled for an ""Old Navy"" $3 pair for the past 2 years but they were so uncomfortable.
Got the white ones, they came as expected. I am usually a 7.5-8 and I got the 37/38 size (FOR WOMEN'S!) and they fit perfectly just as I expected them too.

These are the really cushy basic ones that have a nice grippy texture without looking too technical.
The white ones are great for summer color shorts, basic dresses. and jeans!
They arrived perfectly on time. Thank you, Amazon!",5
705019,"This robe is ""dreamy"".  I actually bought it for my daughter.  She was in a boutique in TN and walked around with it on the whole time she was in the store.  She could only afford the socks, because she is putting herself through grad school, so I thought I would order it and send it to her for her birthday this month.  It is soft, warm and cozy!  Now I think I need to get one for myself!",5
827766,"It's cute good quality and made for a smaller busted gal like me.  If your large busted the polka dot suit does not have support like underwire.  Just go with the size chart as it is accurate.  The black and white striped suit with red accent trim is a good choice for large busted gals, it's cups are are much larger compared to the polka dot suits.  I ordered them both and sent back the black and white stripe and the top was way to big.  I am a 38B",4
213330,"Bought this because they said it came with an Hermes box and it did not, as a matter of fact, it didn't even have an Hermes stamp on it, I'm kinda disapointed, the belt itself looks nice, but like I said, I pretty much got it because some reviews said it was gonna come in an hermes box.",3

95,"We tried these shirts in the pinpoint fabric, but after washing they are the worst wrinkled shirt I have ever tried.  I have a steam dryer and it looks like it was rolled into a ball wet and then dried, awful!  The quality is fine, but if you iron your own shirts beware.  Probably okay if you use the cleaners.",1
664628,"I like the shirt, but it is too small for me. I ordered the size I normally wear, and even checked the size chart in the listing. All should have been well, but it was not. The shirt was too small, and too tight. I'm sending it back for a larger size.",4
609236,"These are the perfect weight and feel for summer.  My 5 year old son always wants his legs covered, no matter how hot it is, so these PJ bottoms are perfect.  I might order some for myself.  By the way, he is a boys' size 6-7, and the size small worked.",5
252392,"I received my dress faster then expected. Only problem was that it was too big on me. Originally I am a size small,  5'0. With this pregnancy, I went up a size. I thought a size 8 would fit me but instead the top part was fitted and the bottom was too loose. I have to return the dress and get a smaller size. Also, the powder pink dress is very light and see through. However, it is a wonderful dress and suitable for baby showers and other occasions.",4
697663,"love my dress! It fits perfect its just what I imagined it to be. First thing I did was cut my sleeves off I didn't like the long sleeves. I had to get it altered which just cost me $150 which is not bad for the price of dress itself. Honey you couldn't tell me nothing on this day. OCT 8, 2016",5
80959,"I would not recommend these glasses. The glasses do not even fit in the case. When you have the glasses in the case no matter how you turn them the case will not close. I guess it like the old saying ""you get what you pay for"" cause these were very cheap in price, but also very cheaply made. Sorry for the bad review but I won't purchase again.",1
267382,Amazing!!! It fit me perfectly and it is great quality. I went to Megacon in this and was stopped by a ton of people asking to take pictures and complimenting me on it. It was even mistaken for one of the ones that cost hundreds of dollars. I am very very happy with this dress and would order it again in a heartbeat.,5
206792,"Looks cute and professional in the photo but in reality not so good.  Needs to be ironed when coming from the wash.  The navy collects lint like crazy.  The fit is not tailored as in the picture, it's very full and not easy to tuck in.  The material does not stay crisp.  The sleeves are 3/4 but are exceptionally full instead of form fitting.  Lastly, the blouse is missing buttons in required places.  No buttons on the cuffs and at the collar.",1
123528,I'm very satisfied with the quality and fitment of this shirt. I am very anal about how a shirt feels and fits and was hesitant ordering this not knowing how it would be. I figured worse case I'll just send it back. It's definitely a keeper and the fit is more of an athletic fit so if you like your shirts a little baggy you should get one size up or order two different sizes and return the one that you don't want. I can't wait to wear this out in my bible thumping redneck town lol.,5
154764,"I thought it looked nice but it was too tight on me. The material wasn't cotton and I'm not sure what it was. It felt weird on my skin though. and it kept me too warm, so I didn't wear it. I just wanted it as an overshirt but felt more like a thin sweater I guess.",3
622681,The size says for most. I think it should be made available to choose my size. I had to give mine to my 16 year old because three is zero way it would fit me. The material is good and I would have given 5 stars of the size was an option,3
819406,"This bathing suit is very cute and well made. The top fit my teenage daughter well but the bottom ran a little small. She can still wear it bit she said she may wear a cover over bottom because it's a little tight. So I recommend ordering a size up for bathing suit to fit properly.

315216,"Beautiful Packaging, Beautiful Product!
I ordered this product for my friend and her husband and I could not be happier. They loved it and I thought it was beautifully and professionally packaged, along with the sweet sentiments of course. The bracelets were a little smaller than I envisioned, but that does not take away from the quality of the product. Simple, clean, elegant, timeless, just beautiful.",5
273403,Great belt!!!  Exactly as depicted in photo.  I bought 2 in different colors and although they came packaged differently they both smelled like mildew.  I let them air out and now they are both fine.  My husband says it's a very comfortable belt.  I would buy again.,5
823052,The sizes run pretty large so the top was way too big but fit ok everywhere else. It is a real pretty swim suit but being to big makes it inmodest to swim in but I got it for a Mermaid costume and it fit the purpose. I would order this again in a smaller price because it is a real nice swim suit for under 20 bucks!,3
160855,"Different from the picture. It was stiff and shiny when I first got it. It has softened up and the shine had been replaced with a nice patina. One of my favorites now. Small purses, large purses and backpack/briefcases have completely different functions and cannot be compared. I love my purses and backpacks.",4
536136,"I was kind of upset when I bought this. I ordered a large, to be safe, as I like slouchy sweaters. But when it came, it was nearly skin tight! Plus, the color is odd. It's a bright white when the picture depicted an almost yellow, eggnog color. I tried to order the sweater in black, but it came n white! I mean, I still wear it, but seriously? I do NOT reccomend this product!!!",2
650422,"XXL feels like a Large. it feels nice/great, and it is not bright at all but it's a beautiful shirt, eye catching, the one I have is like wearing skin lol, but I am athletic build but still, I do not want to wear my shirts like that. It has detail but it is not as bright and clear as my Winter Soldier shirt. It is a nice shirt though. and its spandex or stretchy. I will be buying another one as the complements are coming. 5 stars",5
397645,"i thought $10 for a 3 pack... they probably suck. But actually these socks are awesome. They're soft and comfortable, don't fall apart, and work well for moderate to cold temperatures. I've even worn them during hot weather, and they breathe and get rid of the sweat better than some socks twice the price. Worth more than the price.",5
236754,"It's absolute perfection. I bought the small for my tall but thin 5 year old son. Fits him perfectly with a little bit of room to grow. He insisted he wanted to be a cheetah for Halloween because they are ""strong and fast"". Great quality. Very well made. And he doesn't want to take it off! Happy boy. Happy mama.",5
256268,"It's a little tight in the arms. I am around 6'1"", 245, trim, and was looking for an athletic fit. The shirt fits very well overall, but if you have bigger arms, it might be snug there. I have a really hard time finding clothes that fit well, so overall it's one of the best fitting, quality shirts around.",4
73664,"This costume turned out really cute! My kiddo is a 4T and it fit perfectly. I would definitely recommend getting it out of the bag and hanging it up or steaming it prior to use as it had several big creases from packaging. It would also be good to stuff the hat for better shaping. Overall, good value and really cute.",5
17224,"These flip flops have caused me to fall twice so far because my foot slipped off them sideways.  I know this is common with flip flops, but I haven't had this problem with other brands.  I feel the price I paid was not a good value.  They are comfortable though, but I have to walk carefully in them and that makes it a bit inconvenient.  I'll use them in the future, but not much.",3
544192,"Purchased this for my niece, and she loved that it was her sorority and that I purchased it in large so she could wear it loosely. The only reason it is not 5 star was because I thought it would be more fleece lined, it's kind of thinner, cotton like and not more of a thick cozy sweatshirt inside. Overall the quality is nice though.",4
665631,Shirt is not loose fitting it is very tight and short. Tag is cut out. I'm a small and this shirt is a weird kinda silky like material not what you would expect in a t sthirt. Thread  strings hanging all over. Don't waist your money you money u less you want to look cheap.,1
539346,"I brought this to Hawaii as I burn extremely fast.

The good: I didn't burn anywhere where this hat  shaded my skin.

The bad: While the hat fit, it was a little tight and did not have much ""give""; most hats fit me fine, that being said, I may just have a bigger head than this was made for.",4

I like a longer hoodie which this is but it's not slim fitting in the torso. It's too baggy in the torso, looks like I have a kangaroo pouch. I was looking for something to wear outside of the house but if you want something to lounge in at home then this is a good warm hoodie for the winter",4

454100,"It could be a little bigger, although my head is a bit wide. It barley gets over my ears, which cause issues when I wear my headphones because I have to move it above my ears exposing them to the cold. Great material, great design, and amazing comfort. The only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is because it's not custom built for my head lol.",4
456055,"This was a gift for my little great granddaughter. The colors delighted her and she insisted putting them on immediately.  For this reason I did not return them. The fabric was of poor quality, they fadded, in fact even looked washed out after the first washing not to mention the shrinkage was far more than 6%. I washed them in cool water and used a mild detergent. Dried them on cotton setting. I have purchased other items from this company and was satisfied.",1
578281,"I ordered these for my upcoming beach wedding. Since my dress is ivory, I went with the cream colored pearls. They truly are an ivory cream color! They match the earrings perfectly also! I have a small to average size wrist, and even though the bracelet is stretchy, if you have large wrists, this may not be the bracelet for you. But I LOVE it!",4
865036,"Really nice no-shows for the price. They run slightly small, but feel great and stay on well. the method used for staying in place are a few strips of non-slip 'gel' on the part of the sock that hugs your achilles tendon really well. Very satisfied. As other people have mentioned, the packaging is amazing. Now we just have to see how they stand the test of time.",5
232657,"The rings are very cute, but they are very small. I wear a size 8 normally, and there was no way that I could get these on my top knuckles. I gave them to my sister who wears a ring size 6 with skinny fingers, and they fit her top knuckles perfectly",4

I mean crap, started falling apart the first time she wore it.  But since it is so cheap (inexpensive) it is not worth the hassle of returning it, but, maybe that's what they planned on..........",1

382574,"Loved the feel of the material, the style and the look. However, this was extremely small. I normally wear a medium to large in T-shirts so I ordered a large. This was like putting on another skin. I don't even think going up to the x-large they have would fix the problem since I was wanting it to wear as a swimsuit cover-up.",1
315500,I did not expect much considering the price. The beard is very cheap and the hat is uncomfortable. I also don't have a large head and this was small on me. my fitted baseball hat size is 6 7/8 - 7. I wear a medium in the elastic banded fitted hats. hope that will give you a rough estimate on the fitting o f this hat.,4
70926,I bought these for my granddaughter who has sensory issues.  Most panties irritate her and she will take them off whenever possible.  I bought these and she has kept them on with no problem.  If you have a child on the spectrum who has issues with clothing being uncomfortable these are wonderful.,5
441283,a box larger and wider than a shoe box arrived.  Inside were at least half a dozen layers of satin bags and jewelry boxes in progressively smaller sizes ending in a plastic ziplock bag about one inch square. What a waste of resources! I am not impressed. The stones in the necklace are much smaller than the 6 mm as described.,3

The shirt is made of quality materials, and I can tell the lace will last quite a while. It's casual,yet the lace gives it a perfect sexy look, which I absolutely love.

I was hoping for something loose-fitting and comfortable but it's very restrictive and I can barely move in it.  I would recommend getting a larger size than what you think you need.  Also the hood is huge and the ears don't stand up like in the picture.",3
757863,"I am disappointed in the sizing.  I ordered a large, which I have never worn anything bigger than a large and sometimes wear a medium.  The material is clingy and doesn't fit like I want it to.  However, I'm going to put a short vest with it and wear it because I do love the color.",3

If you're used to wearing ties that are too short for tall people, it will take a few tries to get the right feel of where to tie the knot, but once you do, it's nice and even. I wish they had more colors!",5

329526,"I purchased two of these belts - the first one I opened the belt buckle was broken, the other one was fine. Being allergic to metal this belt was great. I am going to order more!  I only gave it 4 stars as I do not like to send things back. I do not like it when things are broken or missing in an order. However, the return was very easy - just wish they could have sent me another belt verses a refund.",4
148676,"Transitioned to this gown after using the 3-in-1 gown for labor and delivery. Very comfortable.
If you're busty (Im a 36 J), you know that stretchy necklines can be a problem. This one didn't have enough fabric in the front to keep me covered, so I turned it around and wear it backwards...problem solved!",5
316955,"Nice top, not a dress for me, some reviews on a similar item stated that it runs way too small. It was a little snug for me but I could still work it as a top unless you like very short dresses!!. It is very nice and light material to wear at any season because the sleeves can be rolled up or down depending on the weather. I would suggest going one size up for US sizes though.",5
34023,"It was a birthday gift for our son in law.  When he first opened it, he thought it was a laptop messenger bag!  The list inside the flap gave away the real purpose, and was a hit.  This bag will be used long after the baby - when it finally gets here - is out of diapers thanks to quality and styling.",5
569007,I am giving this 3 stars only because I read the reviews before purchasing. I ordered a size up but the dress is still too small in the bust and sleeves.  Very pretty and would be a good length of I was smaller on top.  If you are petite then I would recommend.,3
801180,"I really like the color. The top is adorable. I am 5'4 and weigh 135lbs. I got a medium. The bottoms were too small, the strings dug into my hips. The top fit perfect and is so cute. I'd recommend going a size up though because I bought it hoping it be just a tad too small on the top. My boobs aren't going to fall out but it hugs them well.",4
508383,"Loved this ring a lot. I wear it everyday, but unfortunately after around three months of wear a crystal fell out. I love this ring, though so I continue to wear it. The empty slot is covered by my finger so it is not noticeable. I would caution buyers to know that you get what you pay for.",4
343000,"My mom got this purse to take on our trip to Europe and she loved it. It's pretty small, but you can put everything in it! there are SO MANY pockets. You have to be careful because we lost hotel keys and credit cards all the time (or so we thought) because mom couldn't remember which pocket she put it in. Overall, it came in very handy. It looks very nice as well. Sturdy material.",5
614719,"Cute for laying out in. I was not expecting much at this price, so I was not disappointed to find out the it was quite see-through and probably shouldn't be worn in water. However, it fits well and will be great when laying out tanning this summer. I love the look, just not quite the quality.",4
419269,It was not what I expected.  Not really fond of it.  Would not buy it again. I wear it basically around the house and for that price I would have liked to have seen it look better so I felt like it was good enough to wear out.,3
114467,"So far I have only used it as a shoulder wrap and let  it flow in the breeze over my head as a sunshade. comes in handy, Hope to make it to beach today, as of this writing I am not sure of how it works with sand or water or laundry or clips. I am happy with it",5
349802,The star is pretty but way too big to wear as a nose ring in my opinion.  I wanted a fake one that I could try before getting a real one.  It is cute as a top of the ear ring but I don't like it for the purpose I purchased it for.,3
399530,"I bought this one for the one Kanji symbol in the middle. I still haven't used the other stencils, just that one. It means WIND in chinese and I love to have it! These stencils are great! Get yourself a starter set because these are the easiest way to get designs on your nails.",5
425745,This watch is sexy lol. when I first seen it I thought it was cool but I was skeptical because how dark it looks but once I read the one review the watch had I knew for sure that was enough for to purchase it. It looks even better in person than it does online. It suits anyone who as a big wrist and the price is just right. you truly get your moneys worth,5
738060,"This product does not deserve a rating at all but since I had to rate it , it gets 1 STAR. It was absolutely horrible, you could tell it was cheaply made, it definitely didn't fit how it was suppose to. I will never buy from this company again .",1
567642,"I like that this is tunic-length even on me (I am 5'8). It's a bit itchy, but cute and as pictured--two things that knocked off a star: the strong chemical smell that comes with all cheap clothes from China (wash before wearing!!), and the very small neck opening. Also, it's ""one size fits all"" but it definitely won't work for anyone US size 10 or over. I'm size 6-8 and it's perfectly snug.",4
137413,"This blazer has an angled zipper closure that is not visible in the picture. But if you are looking for a snazzy and inexpensive way to dress up a casual outfit, this is it! As with most of the cheaper clothing you will purchase online;the fabric is a bit thin and the sizes usually run about a half size to a full size small. This jacket runs about a whole size small. It is also on the thinner side. THis makes it perfect for layering.",5
406676,I bought this as a gift for Mother's day to give to my wife.  I was concerned about how fine the level of detail would be for the price and more importantly for the lack of being able to examine the piece before purchase.  My fears were for nothing.  The level of detail in the carving is excellent and the filigree is nice as well.  Shipping was a little slower than I would have liked from time of order to actual ship date.,4
155194,"It's pretty neat, conversation piece and unique to the ""wallet scene"" I guess.  I've got 2 cards in each pocket and it stays closed (2 weeks in). I tried to fold 5 bills and put them in the wallet as well but wouldn't close.  I keep it in my front pocket which is my favorite part but my keys have scuffed it a bit.  No big deal for $15.  I shall see how long the hinges and clasp last.",4
566708,"I love it. You get what you see. Well besides the tights. The tights are like stockings and they were to small for me (I got a 3x-4x), mask was to big but I have another one laying around. The diamonds came off so I had to sew them on, the skirt is to short, and the top shows a lot of cleavage (I have a huge chest), but its cute and it fits :) the arm warmers are perfect and comfy, and the choker is amazing.",4
680470,"I loved it, came in on time. It is a tad see through but with an under dress I'll be fine. Plus it is pretty short, I'm 4'11 and i got a small so if you are pretty tall ..i would get a bigger size unless you're okay with wearing it as a shirt. Otherwise happy with my purchase.",5
225831,"It was a tiny bit tighter than expected, but it still totally fits. It looks exactly like the picture. A very nice, thick material. It is a pretty long skirt so I might hem it, but it was well-worth the money. It flares quite a bit which is good for the ladies without hips (me).",5
540881,"Product arrived sooner than expected. It looks really good for the price. I am pretty petite and ordered a medium that fits nice, so i'd suggest maybe a little bigger, depending on how short you want the coat. The only thing a little off is the buttons and opening, but it's not too big of a deal. I think it's quite a steal!",5
514544,I was very hesitant in this purchase because of the low price. I figured the bag wouldn't be that great. To my surprise it was awesome for purchase price.  I purchases for my neice to use for overnight sleepovers and she loves it. Nice and big and pretty sturdy.,4
122805,"I purchased this for my husband for his birthday. He's pretty specific about the kind of wallet he carries, and absolutely loves this one. He did remove the removable ID window and uses it to hold business cards instead. The wallet seems nicely made, quite sturdy and is a good buy for the money. I'd certainly recommend it...my husband would too!",5
762914,"I bought this as a gift for my yoga teacher to show my appreciation and it is truly lovely!  I really like it and most importantly, she loves it!  My only suggestion would be to add an explanation of the stones' meanings in with the gift box (which the box is really nice too).  I wrote down the meanings for her in a card, but for future it would be nice to include it.  Size was perfect too. Thanks!",5
734740,"I wear a small to medium shirt, ordered two of these in medium and they fit perfectly. The white isn't quite opaque, but I don't feel the need to wear anything underneath it, the oatmeal was completely opaque. These shirts are exactly what I was looking for at the best price I've found, even with paying for shipping. Very happy with this purchase!!!",5
819108,"These pjs are somewhat large as pjs go, since usually the shirt is snug. BUT it still didn't ride up. My son wears a 3T and it fit more like his Tshirts. But these pjs are SOOO SOFT!! I got some other ones (Gerber) and these feel sooo much nicer. Totally recommend!!!",5
613243,"I would not buy this hat again. I have purchased many hats on Amazon and I am happy with them all. But this one is the exception. Perhaps I will grow to like it; the hat was folded in package and I am still trying to get it to take the right shape. I am unsure of material (straw, rubber, paper or what?) It feels heavier somehow, the photo image is not what I expected it would be. I am sorry.",3
28140,"I love the full length Powerstep insoles.  These are as good, if not better, than the more expensive brands I've tried.  I also have tried the gel-type half size insoles which just don't supply the comfort of the Powerstep.  I know different things work differently for different people but I'm totally sold on these full length insoles.",5
46633,"I ordered the small size because of having smaller ears and they fit perfect.
They are much better quality than I expected. I had bought Earbag brand many years ago and these are by far better constructed and are much thicker material. I live in the northeast and it tends to get quite blustery in winter. So far they seem great at blocking the wind.",5
570895,"and not a nice soft kind either, I'm talkin like some kind of gross packing foam you'd get on your skin and you'd be like ""eugh.""  its 100% gross and you'll want to only wear it over a long sleeve shirt.

the hood might fit over your head, if you have a really exceptionally small head.  But if you're not like that waiting room dude from Beetlejuice then the hood is strictly decorative.

I can't really imagine anyone being happy with this item.  I don't know, maybe people with foam fetishes or something.",1
346518,These gloves are not thick but more on the thin side. The touchscreen works but only if your finger is all the way at the top of the glove. The gloves were a little big for my hand so I always had to wiggle my fingers up to reach the tip to be able to use my phone. They are not bad for the price though!,3
366963,"I ordered the small, as I am usually a S/M (I am 5'5"", 113 pounds, and 34 D). It was the perfect top I was looking for to add to my closet and something I cannot wait to pair with cardigans in my cold office in the summer months. I would highly recommend. I have not washed it yes, so I am not sure how it holds up in the wash.",5
50102,I bought the pink color t-shirt I love the color but the material is thinand the large size feels like a small size and on top of that what disappoints me which only gives me to want to give it a two star because he has no pocket  other than that it's okay,2
58171,"Thankfully, I bought 2 of these necklaces because one of them has already ripped. It might be my fault because I am a tri-athlete and wore it while swimming. I also wore it in the shower several times. I have had this type of necklace in the past and found them to be more durable. They are not expensive and I use them frequently. I will now purchase extra necklaces since I know they wear quickly.  I will purchase them from this vendor again and not wear them while I am swimming or in the shower.",3
28197,"I now own a pair of these, one of the Powerstep Green, and a pair of ABEO insoles from the Walking Company.  Prices were roughly $24, $44, and $70, respectively.  I actually like the most expensive ones from the Walking Company the least and the other two pair about the same.  I will definitely order these in the future since I believe they are the best value for the money.",5
52094,Bought a grey 6-18 month one of these over a year ago and I still love it. Great size that my son wore from 12 months and is still wearing at 30+ months. Wanted one for my daughter and bought a lavender 9-18 month one because that was all that was available. The 9-18 month one is so much smaller than the 6-18 month one. Doesn't make sense. I was very disappointed.,1
632761,"I love the look but quality leaves a lot to be desired, unfortunately. After only one week of using it on my trip, with just a wallet and a small camera inside, the long strap broke off. Sad, but I have to return it. Otherwise, it is a beautiful beautiful bag. Indeed, I did not expect such bad strap quality from such a good brand. I wanted to keep it but paying over 120 dollars for something that breaks so fast - I think it is not fair...",3
380605,"First time buying this brand, but after receiving it quickly got on the computer to check what other items they have.  I love that there are no tags, very light breathable cotton....did not shrink after washing and received several compliments on how cute they were.  I will definitely recommend these pajamas!",5
424373,This top shipped really fast and I loved it when I saw it. It is funky and fun and looks great with skinny jeans.  I wore a long tank underneath because the back is short and the front is long. The size is generous and it is very comfortable.,5
825984,Great product for the price.  My wife really loved it. It's just like a really expensive one she was eying.  Got this one for her and it was a hit!  We did have a little mishap though.  One of the straps on the front came off on first use. So know that the stitching is a little subpar but can be easily fixed.,4
18593,"I bought this hat for my son last year and loved it so much I bought another one in a larger size for him this year. It is lightweight and seems to be comfortable. It is one of the few hats he is willing to wear at all, and he wears it all day. The only drawback is that it can become a bit floppy with age and frequent washing, and then it tends to get in his eyes. Overall, it's a great hat. I wish I had one.",4
882017,"I'm 5'6"" and 145 pounds with a big booty so, I always order large when it comes to swimsuits. This suit is SO tight on me. Like a small or medium. I'm really glad that this suit was as cheap as it was because it would have cost me more $$ to return it. I considered buying again (an XL this time) but the price doubled when I chose that option. If I could give this company the finger, I would.",1
637952,"The dress is very pretty, but it runs very small in the waist and very large in the bust. If you're not an extreme hour-glass, be prepared to alter this before wearing it. I'm short, so I plan to take some fabric either from the hem or the oversized bust to redistribute as needed, personally.

Not as comfortable as some of the other items I've gotten from SheIn before - the fabric is a little scratchier than anticipated - but it does flow nicely when you move around.",3
767179,"Fits as expected. Not a ""woman's cut"" t-shirt, which are often on the smaller side, but is a unisex fit, which I prefer. Has room to move around in. Love the design. The material isn't as soft as I'd prefer, but will wear in with time. Overall, great for pairing with yoga pants or jeans.",5
822209,Please don't get this jumpsuit. Who ever sewed this needs to be charged with a misdemeanor. It was like someone gave me a wedgie. A permenant thong jumpsuit. The shoulders pull downwards. No one is built that way. The only way I could fit this jumper is if I only had legs connected to my neck. DONT BUY THIS!,1
340830,"Beautiful material, fits myself and granddaughter and goes right back in shape. Amazing.  And most importantly you can't see through the material. The leggings are comfortable and soft.  Made well.  You will love them.  I'll update as time goes on.  Worn twice and washed once in cold water. I also hung dry.",5
181670,"I've been wearing this style of shirt for quite a while.  Especially like the 2 pockets (IT nerd paradise :), and what's been described as ""thin"" material (great for TX summers).  VERY easy care: perm press/warm wash & perm press dry == no ironing (wrinkle free). The problem's been finding a variety of colors in my size.  When this 'fig' option popped-up as in stock, I was all over it.",5
263579,"For the price I cannot complain! I usually wear a medium, size 8 in tops and I bought the xxl. It fits perfectly to tuck into my skirts because it is a little blousy on top, but fitted on my hips and doesn't create a lot of bulk under my clothes. I wish they had more conservative or solid-colored options and I would buy them all.",5
212359,good trade off between quality and price.  It's just a glove so why pay more than you need to.  It's warm and it fits well.  I really don't need to use my cell phone out site in the freezing cold.  I tried and it works some time.,5
176941,"This was a gift for my niece for her high school graduation. She's loved wolves since she was little, so I knew she'd like it. It was a lot smaller than I thought it would be. The picture makes it seem much larger than it is. However, I'm happy to report that she loved it when she opened her gift and put it right on. I've read other reviews that said the clasp broke quickly, but so far she hasn't had a problem with it.",5
192310,"Worked well, but both times I tried to wear the silver hoop, I got an infection. Potentially just a sizing problem (I think they were too small and stretched my piercing hole), but could be the metal too. They stayed in well, looked good, and felt very durable/strong, but were not the right choice for me. Make sure you know exactly what size hoop you need before buying these (or any others!) to avoid infection, scarring, ripping, or other problems like me.",3
398618,I was very disappointed in this product - cheaply made and didn't work well; instead of an alarm sound it made a weak buzzing noise (and this with fresh batteries).  I gave it one star only because that was the lowest possible rating.  I'd really give it zero stars.,1
579156,"Cute dress but it came very wrinkled and is spandex like material . Very tight fitting all over
Size is a small too. I ordered two sizes bigger that I am and it still was too small. This dress is not flattering at all . I think the only women that would look good in this dress are very very thin women.  This is not a dress to flatter a full figure women",1
771321,I placed this order for a Christmas present for my cousin. Was super excited about it and knew she was gonna love it! I got the totally wrong thing and was super disappointed about! Don't recommend unless your lucky enough to get the right thing or you want a flower necklace.,1

Pro - it looks amazing on!!!",3
300591,"Way too loose to be worn. Ring comes unclicked & falls out with the slightest pressure, to the point that it's not wearable. The ring does look like the picture, but the shape is a little off when worn. It is a pretty piece of jewelry but useless if one can't even wear it.",2
382129,These socks are amazing and extremely comfortable. I was surprised by how friendly the company was with a very nice email after the purchase. I got to use them for the first time yesterday and amazed by the quality of the product. The heel has silicone so the socks stay with your feet. I was walking all day and love them. The size chart is accurate. I highly recommend them. I am usually very picky on the quality of products.,5
346162,"The cap was supposed to have embroidered text. It is not, it is painted text. The photo online does not show that it was a mesh back but, it is. I wouldn't have ordered it if it were. Cheap would be a good word to describe it. Live and learn.",1
411983,"I love this necklace! I've had it for over a year.  I had purchased one from a different seller on a different site and then left that necklace at a hotel.  When I saw it on Amazon for cheaper, I jumped to replace it.  Actually, I was on the internet to replace it, I love it that much! It's no bigger than a quarter, but I like that.",5
24783,"These are excellent insoles. They totally changed the way my foot problems affected my walking, sleeping in, etc. my shoes are very comfortable with these insoles inside.  Following the advice of my orthopedic surgeon, I was fitted for and purchased the $400 insoles from an orthotic. WHAT A WASTE.  I use the insoles from Amazon every day. The expensive ones are ????",5
578341,"Great product for thick hair. It's heavier than you would think out of the package. I love this product, it has become my go to hair piece.

301044,"AMAZING! You won't be disappointed in this dress I promise! This dress is actually for my sister so it is a little big on me, but I wanted to show you how beautiful it is. I didn't iron out the dress yet so don't mind the wrinkles...Beautiful and inexpensive. I am so happy with my purchase!",5
127505,I was very excited after trying this on because suprisingly it fit so well. I was also impressed with the amount of time it took to get to me. Unfortunately when I went to zip up the back there was no zipper attached. Since I needed the costume for the next day I did not have time to send it back so I had to make it work. Needless to say I had to rig the back luckily the cape covered up the back so you could not see the malfunction.,3
264819,"Ordered a Medium but got a Large, but decided to keep it since it fits fine around the thigh area although I am going to have to fix it since it is quite big around the waist, I am 5'3 and weigh about 120 pounds. I would recommend a Medium size.",3
389977,"First, these are very comfortable.  However, the leg holes on them stretch out making them unwearable. Do far it has only happened with the dark blue ones.  So it could be a fabric issue or who ever is in charge of the dark blues at the undie factory is asleep at the wheel.  I have had to throw away quite a few of them.",2
201486,"I like this belly band just fine. I'm still pretty early in my pregnancy (15 weeks) so it's rides up when I sit down. I don't know if this will stop once my belly is bigger? It works okay to keep my pants up but I'm still using a rubber band tied to my buttons + the belly band and everything feels like it's not moving out of place. The white band is a little see through, I definitely need a cami or long shirt to cover my open pants.",4
110728,Looks very vintage online but it's actually BRIGHT BRIGHT yellow!!! Not faded yellow as it looks. It's awesome that its so inexpensive but it just doesn't look anything like the picture shown. It looks like something you might win at a fair sadly. But either way it would be great for a preteen. Just not what I had in mind when I bought it for myself.,1
502530,"This fabric was very thin, like sheet thin if not thinner. It looked like it had been sewn backwards and by a amature. Part of the seam is always hanging our even if you reverse it.

DO NOT BUY.",1

I would probably size down if I were to buy it again, but it's wearable, so I kept it.  My only complaint is that it doesn't have adjustable straps, so I am constantly having to pull the shirt up.  Otherwise, it's a very cute top and the material is nice.  Just wish it were a little smaller!",4
801378,"I wear an XL, and that is what I ordered, and it fits perfect. The material is nice, and light, and the bird design is really pretty. I plan to wear leggings, because it is on the short side.

I got all kinds of attention from this product, good and bad, but that's the beauty of it because who doesn't love to start arguments about politics with people who know nothing about their candidates. Although the election is over now I would say it's still a great purchase if you want to show your support and look good at the same time.",5
770549,"Thinner than I had expected however it is extremely warm. I bought this to replace a 10 year old robe and I really like this one. My only complaint is that The bottom of the robe tends to open up from the knees down in a V shape, so I think they could have used more material so that the robe will stay closed. I'm 5ft 0in, 120lbs and purchased a small.  I guess i could use a medium but then I am afraid the sleeves and the overall length would be too long.",4

96239,"I like this dress very much, the style and fabric are worth the buy. I am an average size 12 and ordered the XL. Should've ordered an XXL to have more flexibility. So if you're busty or curvy in the rear section and you want a little room then order a size up. It will compliment your curves if you order a size down but either way the dress is worth the price - Enjoy :-)",4

I normally wear a size 8 pants, so it's not like I'm overly skinny or anything. They'll do, but they're not exactly what I was hoping for.",3
841370,"Really like this top.  Fits well.  Lace at hem is lovely.  But it's kind of a weird color... I got the indigo, and it's sort of a muted dark blue.  I'm just wearing it with jean shorts, but I think it would hard to match perfectly.",4
615860,"I was very disappointed in this. It's very cheaply made and looks nothing like the picture on the model. I feel like I received a completely different item. I'm only 5'3"", 130 lbs, and this was like a shirt on me. I had to stretch it down to even reach my hips and then it'd go back to being a short shirt in seconds.",1

Also the  design isn't over the top  ridiculous. It's simple and good quality. My sister loves it. The only problem she has with it is that she can't keep change in it.",5
405848,"I bought these as a gift for a relative I don't know very well. they are stylish, yet smaller and not too gaudy, just in case she doesn't wear ""chandeliers"", but they are modern enough that even if she does like big dangley jewelry, they aren't too conservative. I am happy with the very pretty blue color and the shiny silver. they are cute and well worth the price.",5
499022,"This sweater seems more like a teal color rather than an emerald green. It's pretty warm, and I don't dislike teal, but it'd be nice if I knew that beforehand. I got a large and it fits perfectly for me. I'm 5""5 and about 140 lbs. Would give a perfect score if only the color came as described.",4

It is almost a crop top on me! I do have a long torso for my height so that may be part of the issue. Otherwise it is a very cute top and I look forward to wearing it.",4
125663,"It's ok but the flower broke apart the first day I had it. It's fun for a one time thing or just to play around with. I wouldn't wear it out though it's not that pretty.
It isn't shaped much like other masks are. It also came in a flat package. And it's plastic with lace on it.

The laser cut metal lace masks are very nice quality compared to this and still relatively cheap. They are also pretty and come in a variety. I'd go for one of those instead.",1
688117,"This ring loos exactly as pictured, is very sturdy and strong, it feels different than 14k GOLD which the ring I lost was made of, this is heavier and more scratch and stain resistant, 8mm wide sounds big but it fits perfectly on an average male hand, I ordered size 10.5 and it was perfect.

On a side note, I was lucky enough to find this ring that looks exactly like the one lost, only downside is that white Tungsten cannot be engraved easily.",5
252511,"I had regular running shoe before I bought this pair. Playing badminton on my old pair really hurt my feet, especially toes. I did a little research and finally went for this pair.

This allows things to slip down into the wallet where they aren't visible, and makes it difficult to retrieve them.  I gave two stars because the material is actually nice.  Just not really functional for 20 cards as advertised.",2
126267,"It's really cute and it has held up well to the abuse I have put it through so far. I really like the almost modpoge coating over the design that protects the wallet from moisture and stains. The logo on the front looks like the nude one, it doesn't have the red stiching- which I was really happy with. The ID pocket is the perfect snugness -not too tight so that I can't get it out and not too loose where it falls out.",5

461892,"The blouse is so cute. I was a little bit scared by what others said about the blouse. I ordered the smallest size and it fits on me. It's actually a little bit loose on me. Maybe, the only down side about the blouse is, I had to sew the buttons because they were not well-sewn.",4
122704,"I've had it for close to a year now, so here's my thoughts:

It's reliable and well-made.  The credit card holder slots didn't get all stretched out or loose.  It stayed pretty crisp and nice.  No complaints, I'd buy it again.

I'm not a fashion expert but this wallet looks pretty hip, but heck, what do I know?

All in all you're not going to be disappointed.  I'd buy it again if I lost mine.",5

On the pro side, they look good (for the first few minutes before they ride up) and they are a great material. Unfortunately it's back to the tried and true ExOfficio give-n-go boxer brief for me. These just don't work. Your mileage may vary.",2

I felt so bad that I allowed her to see the bracelet before Christmas and I think she only said she liked it because I got it, not because she want it. PLEASE STOP SELLING THIS. This is not 1/2 ct. They look like pieces of plastic stuck in the bracelet. It's cheap looking and over priced. I AM SO DISAPPOINTMENTED! SMH",1

I am in my 50's and wanted something fun for an event.  Took a while to arrive but did.  Definitely order 2 sizes up and hope you don't get one that is a one size fits all because it doesn't.  lol  Cute print!,3

But no regrets though.",4

724819,"Originally ordered because of favorable reviews.  I am only 5'2"" and unfortunately the fit and style makes me look even shorter.  It was larger than I expected but will keep and probably use as ""mix and match piece"".  Also, I didn't realize the crochet type material would catch on everything rather easily.  Overall ok!",3
22406,This is the best hat ever.  It protects my daughters neck and face on sunny days.  It is light weight and easy to fasten so she keeps it on her head.  Love it and also the adjustable string in the back is a great addition for when her hair is in a pony tail and needs more room.,5
796653,The color is not same as picture more closer to raspberry blue. The bottoms aren't same as picture. They go right in between but cheeks so the sides of your butt are hanging out. The top padding was just weird so I took padding out of my danskin dri fit sports bra and they work perfect. Other than the bottoms and the padding I like this bikini.,3
722982,"Has potential to be cute but the fit is a whole size smaller than listed. Also, the material feels weird, and the quality of stitching was terrible. The sleeves were already coming apart out of the package. Also, the design on the back is not altered enough to look like it's on purpose. Some lines meet, some don't. Just overall poor quality.  The seller did offer a full refund, however, due to the poor stitching, which I appreciated.",2

255047,Size seems to adjust well to most body types. My only problem with this is it seemed to be too short to touch the floor so you could see the ring underneath the dress. I would anticipate that this would be a much bigger problem for others as I am only 5'0 tall.,4
663447,"This shirt is VERY see-through and shows bra lines terribly. You would have to wear this with either a bralette or stick on bra in order to achieve the look advertised. If you are larger than a B I would steer clear from this shirt as most people larger than that cannot get away with wearing these less supportive options. In addition, the arm holes are crazy big. for me, the shirt was open down below my breasts. I would have been flashing everyone with every arm movement.

I got the largest size thinking I could compensate for the 'running small' reviews but oh no. I think the sizing chart should be listed as centimetres instead of inches. No joke my 3x didn't even fit my size 8 friend",1

Also the the face of the watch lifts up to reveal the actual watch but it doesn't fully open. You have to push the face up to completely open the watch. Other than that awesome watch.,3
777203,"This wallet is amazing. I had never owned anything by Filson, but after buying this I know it won't be my last. This thing feels tough, the leather is thick and the stitch work is just incredible. In today's world of throw-away culture, it's nice to own something that feels well made and designed to last. With proper care, I have no doubt I just bought my last wallet.",5
470273,Horrible fit. It was as if someone had returned this after shrinking it. The length on the shirt was about 6 inches too short as where the sleeves. It was an absolute horrible fit in the company was horrible to work with on returning it. I ended up just keeping it because they wouldn't give me any money back. I'll use it for leftover fabric for something else.,5

148654,"Just what I was looking for... I bought this as something I could leave the hospital in comfortably and also use as a nursing nightgown. It's more of a nightgown than a dress, but it will be just fine for leaving the hospital when it's hot in June. I am 9 months pregnant now, and it still fits fairly nicely even as huge as my belly is. I already ordered another one.",5
508595,"Color and pants are amazing.  Only reason 3 stars is the back is fit to give you a wedgie it seems.  My ass is nice and big, so anytime I wear it, the pants suck it in.

669126,I love the way these leggings look but they size is way off. I ordered and large and could barely fit it. I gave them to my sister who is size small and they were still to tight and didn't fit right. There is no distinction between the front or the back so it doesn't give enough coverage in the butt area.,2

I look forward to learning more about the Chakras -- which is one reason I bought this bracelet, but truly, I am just so impressed by the colors and the beauty.

 Hopeful that the stretchy band holds up and I don't lose the beads. I may add another band for added strength -- though it seems pretty strong already.",4

704776,I have to agree with most of the reviews. I am a US X-Large..and the description said it was a US size 18.....When it was really more like a size 8 as noted in the size chart...It is definitely not a plus size X-Large. I bought is and it fit more like a Misses Medium. The material and quality was not that great. If it fits seems like a comfortable shirt to wear for lazy days but not nice enough to go out...Had to return it.. Return process through Amazon was reasonable and quick however.,1
33344,Okay so I have to say I was nervous that these weren't going to be high enough or weren't going to fit my size in a complimenting way. I'm 5-1 and 120 lb and these are extremely sexy! They are very complimenting and they stay up on their own :-) so that's most definitely a bonus they come up mid thigh or higher if I want them to. After receiving and trying them on I bought two more colors :-) extremely worth the buy!,5

Still 24 pieces, but I was a little disappointed because the smallest size is what I need the most, and I only got 4 of those, not 6.
Also, the lid on the box is pretty loose, I wish it was tighter and more secure, it opens way too easily.",3
459283,They arrive on time and in good shape. The fit was tight at first but after a few days they fit fine. The sweat band was a good idea and their general quality was good. There is another supplier on Amazon that sold this item for less but I missed it before ordering from these guys.,4

-idk there's this thing that won't come off of the plastic, like a fur type thing? It's not really noticeable so whatever.

143545,I have ordered clothing from Allegra K in the past and it was always great for the price. This is the only one that has fallen short. A cheap black lace like fabric comes up like a turtle neck with no material behind it. It feels scratchy and somewhat cheapens the product. The shirt that was delivered does not look like the picture. Also delivery took 34 days.,2

619152,"My ultimate favorite dress of all the ones I purchased. A little disappointed by the lack of care tag, but I was reimbursed and would definately purchase it again. I got a M and have a bigger than normal bust for a 5'3 girl, but the dress worked. It may be too short for weddings and special occasions.",4
319170,"Came fast. Colors are EXACTLY as pictured and very vibrant. Material is great, hats seem great for fall and winter. They are not slouchy like in the sellers photos. Look at the customer review photos for an accurate depiction. I wish they were a little more slouchy but these will work as functional hats they just are not stylish",2
407092,Once again a gift - this one fits decently and thus gets decent wear but it cannot match up to the Kangol Beanies that I own or have gotten as gifts.  It is also middle of the road in keeping one warm where as the kangol once again excels.,4
779057,"The fabric and workmanship is superior.  It is a little short in length.  I rarely find swimwear that is snug.  A tall woman might prefer to select a larger size than usual.

The cut is comparable to a competition suit.  The legs are perfect.  The wide straps remain in place. Overall, I think it is a good suit or the money, good enough to reorder.",4
75893,"I am very pleased with this maternity band. I've tried other maternity bands and this quality is much better. It has a sticky band at the bottom to keep it in place and stays where I put it. The material is thicker than the others I purchased, which makes a difference. The other cheaper bands I purchased would wrinkle and move during the day, this one does not. As a teacher, this is very important. I purchased a small and it fits perfectly at 5'2 and 140lbs at 12 weeks pregnant.",5
862614,"Destroyed my feet the first 4-5 times of wearing it, I hated the purchase as it had become so uncomfortable. Then suddenly, heavenly! Once they were broken in, they're gentler on my feet, look great, and completely waterproof. Trudged around in constant rain for a few weeks now without the shoes looking like it took any damage whatsoever.",4
326808,"Considering the price, I am getting what I expected.  It is a little too snug in the jacket and definitely too long in the pants.  I will need to have them hemmed.  There was no option to choose an inseam, so this is not surprising.  I guess for the jacket, I can try to lose 5 lbs before my event.  Not a bad plan anyway.",3

274565,"Fit and finish is very nice, the ratchet buckle in particular.  The sizing of the belt is made super easy by the waist sizes being marked on the back side of the belt, so no mystery where to cut.  The ratchet functionality itself is oddly satisfying, My only concern is with durability, as the ratchet ""teeth"" embedded in the belt appear to be made of plastic.  I'll be sure to report back in the event I have any issues, but so far I'm loving it.",5
610404,"I wish Amazon would show a picture of the back of this top -- it is an open back that only connects at the top of the shirt.  I never would have bought it if I had known that, since I planned on this being a work shirt.  The description doesn't mention the open back either.  Nice print at least, but this will definitely be going back.",2
372342,"I ordered a large. The top was waaaay too small Being the top is more of a cup literally a cup the options should include actual bra sizes. Ex. 32a ,32b. The top size is a huge disappointment. The material and the design is nice the bottom was a perfect fit because it stretches",2
256023,"Was surprised by the nice feel of the fabric for the price. I'm layering this time of year so even though it was a cheaper item I took a chance figuring I can always cover most of it with a cardigan or scarf if it's not perfect. But it's actually very cute and fits nicely. Wish it came in some more fall/winterish colors. It does have more of a baggy shirt-dress type shape which I'm liking this year but I know not everyone is a fan of, so if that's not what you're looking for find a different dress.",4
807889,"I bought for my 2year old she weighs around 27lbs but tall. I Figueres this would run small,so I ordered a size 4 and it  fit perfect. I thought the dress was going to be cotton but it is not still love it. I do not know what kinda fabric it is but is cute, and the discount was a great buy.",5
660151,I really like this set.  Keys look good enough for cosplay or just to display.

374605,"These belts are so cute! I bought a brown and a black belt. The brown belt was easy to use and I was able to figure it out on the first try. The black however is useless. The middle portion of the belt is not big enough to fit the strap back through, no matter how much it is manipulated. The strap has already begun to bend and breakdown just in the few minutes I have tried to use it.",3
91040,I got this as a gift for a friend. Fits her very well and so far the quality seems really good for the price. The only thing I wish I could change was the speed of the shipping. It came faster than expected but was still almost a month wait.,4
771058,"Very comfortable for dancing, does not wrinkle easily, and seems well-made.  You could dress up or dress down.  I used it belter as part of a dance costume for performance with a white tutu, but also have paired it with slinky black pants for ballroom dancing.  It would look equally good with jeans.",4
71540,"It's been a long time since I've worked a cross training shoe. This shoe is very light and minimally passed compared to running shoes. That's not meant to be a knock, just a fact.

I ordered the shoes half a size up because as a former runner, I'm used to my feet needing room to spread and swell. I wish I hadn't because they feel a little roomy. I have orthotics, so I think I can remedy the issue once I swap those in.

Otherwise, very good shoes",4
13463,"I got these to play indoor tennis over winter on hard courts.  They are great!  My feet don't hurt after playing, as well as my back.  Normally playing on hard courts would wreck my back and also stir up my plantar fasciitus, but not with these inserts. Get them!",5
300113,"I purchased this ring for my husband, who does not wear his gold wedding band when he is working on cars, yards, etc., to avoid injury.

Although I don't remember seeing it in the add, the ring can be turned inside out so that the orange shows on the outside.",5
620546,"It will good if you order 2 size up. For example : If you size S you should order size L, it will fit your underarms and easy moving hands. And its leaves easy to rip too. Should be careful to put in or take off. Hand wash surely. Totally it was a beautiful shirt but just I got the size M so I can not wear it. The seller offered full refund. Nice !",5
416931,"This is a fantastic ring. It is a thick comfort fit ring that I can't believe cost less than $20. What a value!!
I would give this ring ten stars if I could. The ring size runs large. I ordered a size 8 instead of a size 8.5. The ring fits perfectly. If I lose this ring, I'll buy another. The shipment arrived as promised.",5

-it was ripped
-no gloves

-shiny cream material
My sizes are 5'2, size 6 in dress, small/medium in clothes, 36D cup size",4

You can't see through them (I have $98 lulu's and you can), they have enough elastic to feel support, yet they are durable (I was constantly) and comfortable. The waist can be slightly tight but it's not too bad. I ordered 5 pairs in different colors and sizes.",4
622011,"Arrived after just 4 days! Much quicker than expected. Packaged nice, no weird smell, perfect fit for my 7 month old daughter's average size head. It looks just like the picture. The string inside can go around the chin to help support the hat from falling, or you can just tuck it inside. It also keeps the sun out her eyes.

It has a hard protrusion on the center of my feet and it tormented me all day. I was twisted and crippled after hours of use. I felt like my spine had been misaligned. I have never experienced as much pain as I did after wearing these.

None refundable.

Worst purchase of my life.",1

She likes to hide the torch when showing friends at first to make it seem like magic.",5

It fit comfortably on my wrist, but seemed to be a bit clunky towards the end of the day.  I like the fact that it has less of a chance of tarnishing than silver.  This would make a nice Christmas gift too.  I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion.",4

So Im stuck with one working shoe... awesome. The quality of their items mimic their customer service. Very bad experience. STAY AWAY!",1
742309,I loved the coat but there was No Way it was going to fit me!!! It took a month to get here since it came directly from China. If I had known that I would have ordered something else. I ordered an XL and the way it fit I should have ordered an XXL or higher. They seem to be made for the small Chinese women.,3
704726,"Looks nice in the photo, but that's where it ends. I have an hourglass figure and it cuts me off at the waist. The material is also quite cheap (mostly tulle and lining) and the zipper was broken on arrival. This is Halloween costume quality at best and not worth the price.",1
20890,"5 stars just for the fact that my 2 year old actually keeps it on! And he never lets me put any sort of hats on him. I was worried the hat comes down really low in his face but it doesn't seem to bother him. Makes me feel better knowing his face, ears, his neck are all protected from the harsh sun.",5

22116,Love this hat. The color and fabric is great and breathable. The back of the hat has an adjustment string to make the hat fit snugly on your little ones head and the stings tie securely under the chin. I love this hat and my little one seems to too!  I bought this for her at 2 months and now at 5 months it still fits with more room to grow!,5

167910,"The item arrived on time as expected, which is something you can't take for granted (especially with some of these other sellers). The material is solid enough not to be see-through, but thin and breathable. The stitching is smooth throughout which makes the leggings super comfortable. I've washed the pair once so fair and the material seems to be holding up well. For the price, you really can't beat it. I'm very happy with the style and quality and will be buying more in the future!",5
314616,"I love these! They are the perfect size and variety, the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because the coating on the some of the rings starts to fade sooner than I expected, but for the price, Im not complaining and you can't tell the coating is fading when the ring is in. Ive only had to to use 1 out of the 10 so far and thats awesome!",4
757557,"This runs very small. My son is 2 months, the outfit I got was 3-6 months and it barely fit mostly after washing it. Also, it was a bit difficult to fit baby's head, I was not happy about this. There is a huge gap in the bottom and baby's diaper showed. It would be nice if manufactor added an extra buttom. I ordered overnight shipping since I wanted to have it for memorial day weekend. It arrieved right on time. Overall, everyone thought my son was the cutest in the planet. ",4

The green amethyst is very beautiful, and the color stands out a little more in person than the photo can show. I am really glad I got it for myself!",5

I'm 5 ft 95 lbs and a 32 B. I started to order a medium because of the reviews saying it runs small but I'm glad I got a small because it fits like a glove. And to be honest the quality is AMAZING. Everyone has complimented me saying how expensive it looks and how cute it is. Bottom line, I definitely recommend!",5
418763,"I rated this 5 stars because this ring IS really sharp! It has a gorgeous finish and hasn't scratched at all. The picture does make the ring seem lighter and brighter than it actually is, but the finish and quality make up for the slightly darker 'in-person' appearance. I also had the ring engraved, which also came put great! I would DEF recommend this ring =)",5
763025,"I love this tote for the most part. I originally purchased the crossbody bag in the same pattern but it wasn't quite big enough. Even going by the measurements, this bag seems to be a bit big.  However, the fabric is nice and the pattern is beautiful. My main complaint is that the gold id already flaking off of the straps. It's pretty bad; it looks like I have shiny dandruff on my shoulders. It's a very roomy bag and holds lots of things.",4
9932,"The shoes looked nice but the color was more pinkish red than they looked online; quality was as expected. They also did not fit well--the top of the shoe was too tight. I had to return them. On that note, the company was very accommodating and speedy at accepting the product back and refunding the money.",2
666948,"I bought 4 colors of this same rash guard (purple, white, black, and pink). They are perfect to wear when your top half needs sun protection, but you hate putting on sunblock. Very figure flattering. I am 5'4"", 34"" around my chest, and 130lbs, so I ordered small, which fit fine. When I am paddle boarding or rafting, I like more form fitting rash guards. I tried out my daughter's xs, which I loved even more.",5
733995,"I bought this for my mom as a gift because she is a fall hazard.  I got a large, she is a 8.5 US and they fit perfectly.  They are perfect for her to get to bed safely because of the grippers on the bottom.  This is a great find for safety and much better looking than hospital socks.  Plus, they fit into crocs and make them that much cozier.",5

The only problem is with the belt, it doesn't have any belt holes so it keeps loosening. I am putting another belt with it.",5

Unlike other masks, I wore this the entire night and didn't feel that my head was getting heavy. Fit really well and allows optimum air flow. The overall feel of the material is good, with solid construction.",4
358699,I was iffy on buying this product because of the price but decided to give it a try knowing that all mittens fall off which is annoying.  OMG this is the best!  It NEVER falls off.  I ordered more to have in different colors so I can have handy when the dirty one is in the washer.  A must have product!,5
339082,While a great swim truck/diaper combo I was surprised at how tight a fit this was. Granted you want everything that needs to stay in stay in but it was a little two extreme. I got my son the 6-12 months size (at that time he was just starting to where 6 month clothes) and while it fits for the season it was still leaving deep impression marks on him from the elastic waste band. Other than that I did like the product.,4

I got so many compliments. The garment construction is very good.
The ""Green"" that is pictured though, isn't actually green. I was suprised to find a mermaid turquoise when I opened the package, but I still loved the dress.
Highly reccomend, Received a lot of compliments.
Belt is NOT included, but you can completely change the style and make it your own when buying a belt to go with it.
Fit me very well, I am a dress size 4, but would fit bigger sizes.",5
430751,I have never been a slipper person but I just had surgery and figured something cozy while I recover at home in the winter would be great to have. Although they are cloth all the way around there is non-slip grip on the bottom of these that helps prevent sliding on my tile floors. They are very comfortable and wash well. Would buy again.,5
625887,"This shoe was a huge disappointment to me: not only the color was totally different (I ordered the yellow ones expecting them to be bright yelloww and they are pale yellow), but the material was different as well (they are not patent). Also, they offer no support whatsoever to the sole of your feet: they have almost no cushioning, which makes them extremely uncomfortable. Glad they were on prime and that I could return them quickly.",1

These beautiful earmuffs are (according to their label) made in the USA!  Also, I would not have purchased them if they had been made with real animal fur.  So the ""faux fur"" description was the other big selling point for me. They are comfortable and very dressy looking.  I am very happy with this purchase!",5

You can easily use this on shoes so get the boot model, it will do everything you are likely to own.",5
62202,The product does not fit all body types. After two weeks of my C-section had been very painful to bear this panty .

For something adjusted the product is not as if there was fluid retention in the legs panty pressed up to the legs and hips .. not for sensitive people.,2
83305,The High Definition in these glasses work very well the only thing that I don't like is that the side of the frame is a little too wide and there are blinds spot for driving.  Other then that they definitely do the trick for the sun and giving you a very clear view as well.,4
26401,I wear size 7.5 and they fit perfectly into my shoes.  This my first experience with insoles and chose these because my sister's podiatrist recommended this brand for her plantar faci itus.

The strings on the mittens did break off the first time my daughter wore them but it didn't make much difference to me if they were on them or not, however, I think it's a good idea so the gloves stay together and you don't lose one. My daughter is 15 months and they bands around the wrist were tight enough to keep them on.",4

I normally wear M/L so i purchased an XL and it actually fits like a 2X lol I was a little concerned because all the comments i had seen stated they were made so small. Maybe the company fixed that issue! Either way, it is so comfortable and i love the hood, its pretty big. No it does fit like a coat. it feels like a very thin sweater. Anyway, i really LIKE it :) im getting one for my sister also!",4

It's not tapered in the waist like the picture indicates it's a pretty straight shirt, which makes it no different from any other tee shirt you buy in the unisex section.",3
802768,"This ring looks nice. Both the metal and the stones. The thing is, the back of the ring is hollow which makes it fit loosely for the size. You might want to order a size smaller. I solved this problem for myself by putting a small flattened piece of new clear wax earplug into the back, making the ring fit snugly. Btw I love the box mine came in.",4

103171,everyone who sees this little high heel keychain once one I had to buy 3 now for my sisters then I got another one for myself so I have to in different colors that more I would love to see this and a necklace but of course. His dick was heavy is the keychain but in different colored stones also,5
665800,"Absolutely adore my dress. Although these overseas markets hurts American women's egos with the large sizes we have to order based on the size charts.  I love anything black and white and I paired this with orange pumps and accessories and received rave compliments.  I am normally a 10-12 in the States, but had to purchase the XXL (16) in this  :-(

Definitely follow the chart guidelines if you are an hourglass woman such as myself.",5
614765,I absolutely love this dress!! This is the first time I ever leave a review so that should tell you how in awwe I am! After reading the reviews I decided to go with one size bigger than my normal size. I am so glad I did. I am excited to wear this dress for my brothers wedding=),5
739319,"Got it for my daughter as a fun Christmas present. The material is VERY thin but for a fun top, it's O.K. For the record, this is not a ""Christmas squirrel"", it's a jackalope wearing a hunting cap. But it's very cute and my daughter for some reason likes jackalopes and her husband is a hunter, so they loved it! My daughter wears a medium and this fit; the bottom is snug but it's a loose style and actually pretty cute on.",4
86853,"I ordered this dress in a size XS and it fits just as it should, and it did come with the belt pictured. My only concern is it's a bit see through, but nothing that a white shorts can't fix! Overall, I'm happy with the dress, and it's very pretty!",4
40278,"I love that jacket and it looks great one me. But there are 2 missing braided leather strings for my both arms and it looks really ""s*** "" so I took out from both sides and put on both arms. It looked much better. I wrote to seller and they never never  respond.  Maybe they ignored me.  What disappointing!!",4
372217,"I'm a fan of the over glasses sunglasses style (even when not wearing glasses), so I got these glasses for my darling to keep in his car and he loves it. He prefers this pair to Solar Shield as they are better able to fit over the shape of his glasses. The only negative on these sunglasses is that the side panels are not polarized. I like this pair because they also came with a green neon sunglasses case that's easy to find in a car with a black interior.

Cheers - iShar",5
408135,"I also order this dress for Disney event and this is not a PLUS Size dress. It was very disappointing when I received it to find out the model on the package was 5'6"" and weighed 160 pounds...one size fits most 16W-24W. That's not plus size. I didn't have a chance to return it and I couldn't use it to my event. It was well made but this is not PLUS SIZE.",1
98070,"I am now addicted to these. Yes, it takes a bit of work to find out exactly how to fit as many things as possible in this very well made, sturdy, soft leather pouch. But men don't have the option of carrying a purse- so I have been able to fit my keys, a micro phone charger, cable, adapter, etc in this pouch. It's always there when I need it. Excellent product",5
560660,"Was a good fit, but string a slight bit small in back. I'm an average guy 6'0 260lbs and it fit great. Came quicker than I thought in a descreet package. The mesh part of crotch area may be a problem for men that are senstive down under. Just my Jimmy keeps rubbing against it a lot. Sits right above waistline, so if you have to bend a lot it stays fit and keeps you dry all day.",5
244027,"The length was not a problem, however, there is not consideration given to how slim or full the person might be within that measurement as the only sizing is for height and not chest, or waist, or hips. This is a problem. Also, when I began to button the robe, the cloth cover on button came off the base of button.",3
429278,"The bag was very cute and was a good size.  It was a bit scratchy and the straps were not very secure.  I used it as a carry-on bag and was then going to use it as a pool bag.  Sadly, the straps broke while at the airport and I never got to use it as a pool bag.  I did get a compliment on it at the airport, but I would only recommend it if you plan on putting very light things in it.",2
514555,"I used this inexpensive crossbody bag at Disney for our 4-day trip. It held up well and served it purpose. I can't imagine it would hold up to everyday use for long periods of time, but if you switch your purses out or just need it for a trip, it should do the trick.",4
91873,The quality is as expected as based on the price.  It is a very light weight fabric and does need to be ironed once out of the package.  It is very comfortable and not binding at all. The fact it comes with a cape and hat adds value.  Very pleased with this product.,5
256174,I absolutely love this!! I seen this same exact one on Facebook for $25 so I was thrilled to find the exact same one here.  I bought three and four others in different charms.. I love all of them and you can't beat the price.  I couldn't find any sellers in the States though so it does take a little while longer to get it from China.,5
62611,"Came exactly as described--nice understated burgundy tone, sturdy-yet-flexible felt, etc. It is a tad large for my head (I'm 6 feet tall with a somewhat average-sized crown), but my hair also isn't nearly as long + thick as Matt Smith's is in the show, so I can't really fault the fez for the fact that it seems to be designed for a person with more hair than me.

Overall, I would definitely recommend this as a costume/prop item!",5
429832,"I support the Connecticut State Police as well as my full and total support for all law enforcement officers. As far as the pin is concern, I love it and it has a very good design to it. I purchased 3 of these pins as well as purchasing CT STATE POLICE DECALS.",5
649380,"Super comfy to sleep in and very cute! I'm a size medium/large on the top, small in the waist and large in the hips and the medium fits great, fitted on the hips but not too tight. It's short in the shorts but is very covering on the top, not a low cut. Overall this was a great purchase and I believe I will love this romper for years to come",5
784421,"I have always loved PajamaGram products. This pajama set is soft to skin and was perfect for me. I purchased to wear after my surgery and it didn't irritate my scar site. It is very comfortable. The only drawback is, I am smaller than regular sizes so even though I bought XS size this pajama was slightly bigger for me but that wouldn't affect my rating anyway.",5
86608,"Loved the shirt. It looks exactly like the picture. Unfortunately when I ordered a size 2 (small) I guess I was really ordering a large in whatever country this product is sold/manufactured in. That's what the vendor said. Needless to say, I was dissapointed. Maybe I can shrink it in the washer or dryer...",3
69507,Not worth the money. It gives muffin top. I'm 5'6 and it's exactly a good fit if I had no belly to cover. The part of my belly that needs to be covered is about 75 percent covered. I will maybe be able to use this product once my belly is almost gone and Almost near to my usual size. I bought the small. A medium would have still be the same problem of not be able to cover my whole belly area sticking out,1
754604,"The swimsuit is very flattering and the quality is very good. I almost returned this though because I'm a 36 C/D and it felt small on the chest. I'm also 5' 7"" and it felt short. But, my husband loved it so much he thought I should keep it anyways. It didn't fit me like a glove but it was still worth keeping, just a bit uncomfortable. I gave it 4 starts because I wish it had adjustable straps or a longer version for taller people.",4
462427,"I ""LOVE"" this ring, is so pretty. The 1.02ct Heart-cut Russian Ice on Fire CZ  is so sparkley when the light hits it. is just such a pretty heart shape ring, i really love this ring. Really a great buy for your money !! Anyone you buy this ring for will absolutely adore it !!",5
853164,"SO HAPPY I ordered this bikini last minute for my trip! Well made, sturdy, and material is solid. If you are looking for something closest IMO to hot pink, order the fuscia like I did. It's perfect. I used to be in much better shape and 50 lbs lighter, but I ordered the XL and it's just right. I'm 5'5"", 180 lbs, 38DD. The way it's cut, I would order it again of/when I lose weight. I love this bikini, it's SO flattering.",5
443060,"Good, heavy-quality leather band but be warned: New pins are NOT included for some reason. I've bought several replacement Wenger watch bands over the years, and this one is the first I've ever gotten that did not include new pins -- so save your existing ones when you remove your old band -- unless you have spares.",4
279562,"First time I wore these leggings, the inseam stitching began to loosen and ""loop"" out. I knew if and when I wore them again, that would be the end of them. And it was. Entire stitching unraveled. The material was nice and they fit perfectly. Very poor quality. They are in the trash. NOT recommended.",1
490873,I was excited to get these but when i opened the package the product looked very cheap and low quality. I then connected them to my phone and tried to make a call they kept cutting off no the person on the other line couldn't hear me ... I was only two feet away and also with music you can't be very far away to be able to enjoy them. I do not recommend this product. Warning do not buy!!!,1
136878,"I bought these for gym training - weight class and dance class (body jam, Zumba) - and really wanted to like them, since I loved the color and the light weight feel. But when I worked out high impact, my toes tingled, went numb and cramped because the toe bed is very narrow. Also, there wasn't enough cushion for me. When doing lunges, the ball of my feet hurt. Can't return them because I wore them several times. These might be fine for someone with a narrow foot.",2
713997,"As others have said, they're long but can be shortened with a pair of sharp scissors. Great travel pants! I usually wear size 16-18 and ordered the 2x. They're fine but I almost wish they came in 3x because I'd order another pair or two for those days when all my regular clothes feel tight and uncomfortable. Great shipping too!",5
73395,"I have to say that I was very skeptical on getting this chain cause of the price, but boy am I glad I ordered it. The chain is beautiful and very well sturdy not flimsy like I thought it would be, The clasp is heavy duty not thin like some clasps are, I absolutely love this chain and will definitely be buying more jewelry from this company.",5
454619,"I was excited to get these pants, especially for the look at a $15 price tag. However, I was disappointed when they finally arrived.

Pros:
- Decent looking
- Soft and comfortable
- Fast and free shipping. The item came in two weeks
- Price

Cons:
- Cheap quality
- Very thin
- I ordered a size small and received a Large so they fit a little bigger than expected

Overall, they're comfortable enough if you plan to wear them at home but I wouldn't wear them outside.",3
502348,"Great shoes for my 14 month old daughter.  Good support for a ""new"" walker.  They are also easy to slip on and off with or without socks on.  I will likely purchase another pair in the next size when needed.  These were originally purchased from an Amazon Lighting deal!",5
415972,I am a classic dresser with just a hint of wild. This is a sassy summer shoe of good quality.  I love that I can easily wear this shoe with many of my sundresses.  I love the height.  The sizing is right on.  And for all of that I find them easy to walk in and I get a lot of complements.,5
236556,"As some others have written, the material is basically felt, and the buttons are sewed a little loosely, but the color is true to the picture and it looks cute. Got this as a Christmas present for a friend who I knew would love the look and she was really happy.",4
741434,"I am 5'4"", 115lbs and ordered a size 5. They are form-fitting pants - great color! But definitely not quite jeggings. I would call the material more like regular jean material; there is barely any stretch. The material seems to be good quality. They were used for a dance team performance.",4
432831,"My daughter was baptized in this dress and looked soooooo adorable. Of course the dress is longer than the baby but didn't look awkward. The bonnet kept sliding off her head, but that was expected with babies. There are layers to this dress which made it slippery while holding the baby. Just had to be careful. But great buy none the less",4
581402,"I'm not sure if I'd call this a Henly. It might just be me but I consider henly's to be made of a thicker material. This shirt is very thin and cheep. Its also not fitted. I am 5'11 205lbs, wide shoulders, 35"" waist. The x-large fits ok in the shoulders but is still baggy in the waist and it could be longer. All in all the shirt is wearable but I'll only put it under a fitted shirt. I'll keep it but won't be ordering anymore.",3
381780,"My son who is 2 hated wearing it.  He is always hater bibs and used to take them off.  He even hated covers at night.  That being said I should have known he would not want to wear this when he ate.  The product is efficient, cleanse easily and comes with a small bag to carry it around.  It fit perfect.  Its a good product if your child won't mind wearing.",4
787943,"First, the color sweater I received was a much darker purple than the pink shown in the photo. Second, the brand received was Cielo instead of the Biago shown in the photo. I needed the pink sweater for I costume I planned on wearing Monday at the Elementary School I work at. Now I'm going to have to shop around for something that will work within the next day.",1
840743,"LOVE this bag. Ive had some bad experiences with other sellers on amazon being misleading regarding the size of their items, but this bag is true to the description and honestly higher quality than I expected. I got it for going to the pool and didn't even realize it came with the little pouch which is perfect to throw my wallet and keys in!",5
19985,"Our little one gets easily overheated, so I was worried about keeping a hat on her head. She also had an allergic reaction to the super sensitive sunscreen we put on her face, so we couldn't use any. This hat kept her from getting sun exposure, and she didn't get overheated. The chin tie is great too because she couldn't pull it off. I highly recommend this.",5
100784,"Got this for my 13-year-old son for Christmas.  Makes for hilarious pranks and fun!
It seems to be well-made, and we haven't had any problems.
When we got it, we did need to do something to get the overpowering latex smell out of it.  Washed it out with dishsoap (was careful not to get the hair in the water), and then sprinkled the inside with baking soda and hung it out in the sun for a couple of hours.  Not sure what the neighbors thought about a horse head hanging in our tree, but it worked fine!",5
533977,"I wanted a warm, winter coat with lots of fluffy room. This fits the bill. I am like a big, blue marshmallow in the cold snow but I am warm and comfy. It's like putting on a nice pair of comfy slippers while on Christmas vacation, except then I have to go to work. I recommend this coat for those who like to be warm and comfortable!  It's also stylish in that the buttons are so shiny!  A nice, warm, fluffy furnace of fiberfill!",5
208453,"Kid loved it.  Worked great for a month, then began having small problem.  This is a knit hat.  The ear flaps (which include the air bulb you squeeze to inflate a small bladder that lifts Elsa's ponytail) are knit, therefore as your kid uses / squeezes it, they  will stretch and lengthen.  Soon the flap has stretched to the point that the bladder that lifts the ponytail slides out and has to be manually manipulated / threaded back into the ponytail about once a week.",3
542916,"I read that the size runs small so I ordered a larger size than usual, however it was too big.  Order true to your size.  The sweater looked as expected. Cute, but cheaply made.  The jewels on the shoulder are not attached very well, so I had to re stitch it to the sweater.  I would recommend this to anyone who can stitch, as it is a pretty sweater.",4
189347,"This is a great set, and just what I was looking for. The hardware is almost a rose gold which is my personal favorite and matches all of my other jewelry. I will definitely order from this company again. Quite pleased. Shipping was about two weeks, so less than Amazon's prediction.",5
555867,"this cardigan is the truth! Great quailty and the colours show up just as vivid as should in the picture. The arms do appear narrow but its a knitted cardigan so there is so stretch to it; if you're a small to medium built person you'll be fine.
If you're second guessing purchasing this, just go ahead and buy it, it will be money well spent!",5
648659,"I really wanted to like these as I love the way they look on here, but the 2XL I bought fits more like a large. They were WAY too small. On the bright side, I really liked the feel of the fabric and felt they were constructed really well. Just a shame they are to small.",2
606300,"Very functional wallet. I carry it in my purse, but pull it out when I want to carry less and use the cross body strap. The phone case holds my phone securely and has lots of room for cards. I get compliments on the wallet quite often since it is so pretty.",5
483249,Boots are very nice! Ordered them Wednesday  8/3 got them on 8/5 so standard shipping was very fast. I ordered a 6.5 the box said 6.5 put them on and they were HUGE on me. Looked on the bottom of the boot they are 8.5. Now I have to go through the hassle to return them.,3
294174,"I had high hopes but these were terrible!  I Pulled them out of the package and they came with a stain. Thought if they fit I'd look over it. I usually wear a size 16 or XL, so that's what I ordered - XL. So small and very thin. Incredibly disappointed",1
174380,"This purse is beautiful! I was very suprised at how nice it really is in person. It is not very large just enough room for my phone and credit card, might have been able to put a small car key in too but that is it. So this is just a purse for a night out but it is really lovely. I got a lot of compliments by people at the high end event I took it to. So it clearly looks much more expensive then it is.",5
25009,"These were delivered Tuesday of this week. I wore them Wednesday through Friday (3 days) and they are broken down already. These are absolute garbage and NOT for people who work on their feet. You can get better quality for the same price at Wal Mart, no exaggeration. Powerstep can surely go f*** themselves, and I will be telling everyone to stay away if they work on their feet for a living. Would rate 0 stars if it was an option.",1
85523,"This is as pictured but when i got it in the mail the heart on top had a crack in it and the weight also had a crack in it, i am pleased with the fast service and packaging. i will shop with the vendor again but will ask more questions before i buy.",3
290730,"The skirt fits as expected, but the crop top seemed a bit smaller than I was expecting.  I can still work with it true enough I just though it would've covered more in the chest area and I thought the length of it would've been a little longer.  Overall, I like the outfit though and can't wait to wear it on my trip this summer.",4
762219,The first pair was returned because it was too large.  Used the return label and dropped it off at UPS.  The new ones sent are just right.  Ordered them because my husband's 5 year old crocs works so well for him.  Really has good grip.  Easy to get in and out of.  Great color!,5
75261,"AHHH This is necessary for the transition between regular/maternity pants. Many women use the hair tie, etc. but that left bumps under my clothes. This band smooths everything out, and makes my regular pants comfy. You do have to wear longer shirts because otherwise, people would see the band (which I guess isn't a big deal if you go with black, but the nude cannot pass as a cami).",5
106003,I wish I had gotten a L in this as the Xlarge was really big all over. But I stuck it in the dryer and it shrank a bit. I'll need to take and get it altered some more but all in all it's a cute dress and really warm so it's nice for the winter months.,4
63219,"I got this for my nephew's superhero birthday party. It arrived promptly, well packaged and all the parts included. I read other reviews that say this runs big, and the chart provided online has measurements included. I typically wear a size 10 or 12, so I ordered the M. It did fit perfectly. More snug then I would want but not indecent. The gold belt included in my package was actually a size Small,  so I had to get creative and pin it to one of my regular belts just to use it with the costume.",3
470609,"I won't dig on this belt because I sent it back immediately. I was under the impression I was buying a durable belt as the listing proclaimed. The seller and I have differing definitions of durable. This belt, though nice looking and likely fine for most applications, would not have worked for me.",3
406755,This is a really nice necklace.  the pendant is nice and not overstated and the diamonds sparkle in the light like nothing else in this price range would offer.  Craftsmanship seems to be perfect.  and the packaging was top notch.  You get a certificate of authenticity as well with information regarding contacting them in case of issues. Which is good.  Seems to be a nice company with great jewelry,5
653823,"Got here on 9/23 when it was expected to be Oct 3-20th, so that was nice.  Came in a decent case so they weren't damaged during shipping and they're really cute. There was a warning label in the box saying not to get them wet and avoid sunlight and humid air when not wearing them by keeping them in the box, so they'll probably eventually turn me green, but they'll be cute.",5
715622,"Didn't fit correctly, and had to trim down the glasses to get them to function properly. Also didn't come with the ""free gift"" as advertised. I don't really care about not receiving a pair of junk freebie glasses, but don't advertise that you will be including this when you don't. Would not recommend purchasing from this seller.",1
79284,"This product, I will never ever regret buying. The chain is heavy and feels really nice, the leather is a good quality, and it's so beautiful! It's identical to the pictures, and I wear it all the time. I get many compliments on it. The buckle in the back is of good quality metal and stays put when being worn.",5
716643,I love the colors and style of these panties. They are so cute but had to give 3 stars due to the quality. The panties were actually a little big on me when I first wore them bit now after a few months they have shrunk quite a bit after several washes. I'm sad I won't be able to wear them longer though because they're really cute,3
237913,"After ordering a different beaded lanyard that had the stretchy loops, and having my glasses fall out of them several times an hour, I ordered Peepers Keepers and have been so happy with them. They are attractive, but much more importantly, they keep a firm grip on my glasses. They have not slipped off once!  I strongly recommend that you get Peepers Keepers.",5
705978,"I love these pants!  They are the most comfortable pants I've ever owned, yet look so professional at work.  I got several compliments on them the first day I wore them.  I'm 5'8"" and 160 lbs and they fit perfectly.  I got these on sale; they're pretty pricey otherwise.  I'm going to get a pair of each color though; they are definitely worth it!",5
358122,"I loved these mitts and have bought multiple pairs for baby shower gifts for friends. The velcro ensures that they stay in place, and your baby can't take them off at all. The colors are almost watercolor-like which I loved. The fabric is so so soft. I just wish that Goumikids would make velcro mitts in toddler sizes for kids that have eczema on their hands and wrists and scratch incessantly at night like my son. They're so hard to find, and eczema-specific clothes are so expensive for toddlers and older kids.",5
512649,"The color of the shirt on the web site looks sea foam green.. NOPE! its a lime green i mean bright green!! and the lettering was all sparse and not pigmented at all. only good thing about it was that it fit well.

-should specify what type of color it is.",2
520734,Bought this for my golfer son. We have been looking for an affordable rain suit that is also good quality. This is the first one I have found and it is very good quality and fits great. Has not been rain tested yet but it has been cold and wind tested and performed superbly.,5
386043,"Bought these mittens for our newborn.  He has very long fingers and they were cramped in other mittens.  These mittens have plenty of space for his fingers to still wiggle around and protect him from scratching his face.
Of course, he can still get them off his hands quite quickly if he wants.  The wrist strap only has a small region of velcro so the size of the opening is pretty fixed.  With better tightening options, I would give this mitten 5 stars.",4
131991,"If this fit me properly, I may like it more if I had gotten a smaller size. But it kind of looks like something out of flashdance on me. I love the color and the fabric is super soft and comfy. I am keeping it in case I can shrink it in the wash and if not, it will be great for a halloween costume or for lounging around the house.",3
135152,"Bought these as gift, and she loved them!!  One of the pair came apart at the seam after just 2-3 wearing and washings.  When Barbara's was contacted they credited an very fair amount back to the purchasing card in an extremely timely manner.  Great customer service, thanks!",5
685138,"The shoes are quite cute, basically exactly as pictured.  Since our son refuses to wear shoes and these do not have a strap of any kind to secure them, he hasn't actually worn them much (threw them off during his baptism, which was the whole reason we bought them, much to everyone's amusement).  If you have a more cooperative young'un, they should be nice.",4
779062,"Ordered because I was looking for a one piece suit that didn't fall off my shoulders when active.  I liked the suit, it's pretty and doesn't look like everyone else's off the Walmart rack.  BUT......  I found the cups to be misplaced.  I figured I have a slightly longer torso and the cups were down on my rib cage without enough stretch to pull them up to give proper fit.  I will be returning it.  Nice material though.",3

709647,"Nice, but not all women are made for the same size top and bottom. I purchased this because it it very cute and at a resonable price. I was told to order to i order to make a complete set since i couldn't order two different sizes, but that just means i have to spend $50 for swim wear.",2
810931,"I purchased this sometime ago and finally got to use it. I Love the design;  However, after one  use the metal loops that holds the handles came apart. I tried gluing it but it did not help... So I have no choice but to park it. I must say I am very disappointed... That's why I gave it 2 stars...",2
801371,"I was really disappointed with this dress.  I wanted it to work out, because I like the print so much, but the sizing is completely off.  I bought a size large, and it was very roomy.  I could definitely have gone down a size in the bust and hip area.  But the length is incredibly short.  Too short to even use as a bathing suit cover by the beach!!  For reference, I am 5'-5"", 150 lbs, and bought a size large.",1
774506,"Not sure if this is normal, but the Racer 250 only fits if the props are removed.  I'm not going to put on and remove the props every time I put the drone in this case.  I ended up using it for my DX6 transmitter, which it works nicely for (with a small snip here and there).",3
852522,"Within a week one of the cloth loops that hold the bungee strap came unraveled. It's been 4 months and now all the loops are unraveled and the Velcro that holds the tongue to the straps barely holds. I also bought a pair for my son in blue and while his loops held up longer, the Velcro in the strap did not. Overall poorly constructed.",2

(Haven't had any accidents yet though, so I can't attest to other failures vs. this one's success.) The pattern is cute, and I love the snaps along the side. Does run small though - it said it was for 6 month babies, but my baby at 4.5 mo when I first used it barely fits it. I doubt she'll still be wearing it when she's actually 6 months.",5
88498,"The costume runs large. I read reviews and was expecting that, though,  so I ordered a smaller size than I normally would. It fit great. I got lots of compliments on the costume and think it was a great value. The only thing I could complain about is that a button fell off when I wad wearing it,  but that is an easy fix.",5
349807,"I loved it. Read the reviews and decided to order it. It's a little big BUT still looks nice. You have to watch the way you clamp it to your nose because if you stretch it too much, it'll be hard to fit and may fall out. I lost mine after getting it the other day and decided to order another. I've had my nose pierced times in my life, my nose always rejects the piercing. So this is perfect.",4
405400,i've been hearing that the black paint comes off after a while and i've had it for a week now and so far it still ok. the ring took 3 weeks to get to NY from OK all thanks to the great and worthy UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE it should have been sent via first class mail of even better fedex or ups. I even filed a reimbursement claim against Kerruso after attempting to contact them and received no respond but canceled it a day or 2 before the claim would have been settled,4
174541,I love these! My 5mo old has a huge head and most other headbands are just too tight and leave a mark. These leave no mark and that makes me feel a lot better about keeping something on her bald head most of the day. Only wish they came in more colors!!,5
661347,Great hat at a great price!  I bought this for my husband to wear at the beach next month and I was concerned because he has a large head! Most one size fits all size hats don't fit him so we got the xlarge bucket hat and it fits perfect!,5
172473,"Purchased the Blue with Fiesta Stitch.  The fit is great, and it's quite flattering, but it is COMPLETELY see-through.  Wpuld be fine as a beach coverup, but it was certainly not what I was looking for.
The picture made it look as though there was a lining so the goods wouldn't be exposed...  definitely not the case, though.",2
727502,"TOO TOO TOO TOO TOO SMALL! I was highly upset, HIGHLY!!!!! Cute for you baby girl. I will wear them when I want to wear something petit in my ear, but I am not a petit wearing kind of woman very often. SO MAD!!!!! I thought they would be bigger",1
665636,"I have mixed feelings on this thing. My skin didn't negatively react to it, so that was great. But it is TIIINNYYYY. If I am not very careful it falls out. It is so thin you really cannot even feel it moving, which is nice until it falls out and the only reason you know it fell out was the sound it made by hitting the floor. I don't hate it and will continue wearing it, but I don't just love it either.",4
50603,"Bought these glasses because I thought I lost my old pair of TF's, these glasses are amazing.  I only buy TF because the lens and frames are light; you forget you are wearing sunglasses.  They came sooner than expected and in excellent condition.  You will not regret this purchase they are beautiful!",5
733987,"These glasses are exactly as pictured and are perfect. Not to heavy and not too tight where I would get tired of wearing them, but not too loose where they'll fall off if my face when it's down. It's perfect!!! I don't have a gold pair and I already have an aviator style so I wanted something different but similar. The gold is a nice true gold, the lens is a dark brown and the legs are tortoise, wouldn't have it any other way.",5
494874,Earlier I wrote a review that I did not receive.  They contacted me and resent the items back out to me.  I wish I could find the review to change it but I can't so I am writing a new one.  The item was exactly what I ordered. I also ordered the heart that says mom.  Both fit in my locket that I have.  When complet it will look great. Thanks again.,5
236019,At first glance the belt seems to be well constructed. The belt is very thick and sturdy. The buckle on the other hand almost seems to be plastic but it is not. The metal does seem cheap though. When The buckle contacts my skin out starts to itch so If you are allergic to cheap metals i would stay away from this belt. The buckle clamps right onto the belt and holds firm. The image on the buckle had great detail and looks great. I received this item at a discount for an honest review,3
278544,"I wanted to love this necklace but it wasn't like the image that is shown on Amazon. The dandelion shown on Amazon is fluffy and beautiful but the one that I received is, well limp and dark and is barely visible in the small globe. I wouldn't buy this again. :(",2

603596,"I'm 5'6"" and 125 lbs, I wear a size 3-5. Super cute fit and flattering, but less of a bathing suit and more of a festival outfit/costume. The material is not super durable like a bathing suit. You could probably take it in the water but I wouldn't suggest body surfing in it or anything.",5
465689,I was somewhat disappointed when I got my sunglasses and the sunglass part came off of the actual sunglasses so I can't even use them because basically I got a broken pair. it would be nice to get a replacement but I know that's not how this amazon website works.,1
752495,"This shirt is amazing! The material is a medium, bordering on thick, weight. Not see through. The stitching is quality and the design is well thought out and flattering. It does fit slim around the waist, so if you have a bit of a belly it will show but in that case just size up from the measurement suggested based off the bust. Can't wait to try more items from Patty's!",5
297307,"I'm usually a large or xl, just depending on the brand. I bought this in an XL and it fits pretty loose, just like the picture. I would give this 5 stars, but the slip underneath is too short so I wouldn't be able to wear it other than as a swimsuit cover up because my goodies would show :( my advice would be to order the size you usually are and only buy if you are using as a cover up or if you are planning on wearing a slip underneath.",3
668298,"Ridiculous. I am 5'5"" 150 pounds. I ordered a XXL and the shirt is skintight. Not to mention it's not even the same color. It says it was army green and the shirt is Brown !  The shirt on the model is a completely different style. Not the one I ordered !  Don't waste your money !",1
302970,"I'm 5'7, 110lbs. I ordered a small. The length is PERFECT. It looks just like that picture. My ONLY problem is that the bust is WAY too big for my tiny chest (32a). Definitely happy I bought it though, going to have it taken in, and it will be my new favorite dress!",5
428891,"I LOVED this hat. It was perfect for the beach. Really blocked the sun (and I loved that it had UPF protection). It is cute, and it actually held up fairly well in the wind. I plan to use it for any beach or pool activity this summer that is in the sun.",5
844970,Don't buy this shirt or any others you see are made in china.  The shirt is paper thin with terribly loose stitching and the seams are irregular in places so the fit it incredibly unflattering.  I am a medium and ordered the 3x because of the other reviews stating how small this is but I still wasn't prepared for this.  The 3X did not fit at all and is really tight through the hips and belly ...its a very ugly look. Its not gonna look or fit anything like in the picture.  My worst purchase ever!,1
423172,"The only thing(s) I don't like are the big double belt loops sticking out on the sides.  I understand they're to fit different waists but should've made them flat.  But I can live with them.  Other than that, LOVE how super soft and cozy it is :-)",4
375423,"Fits my NEVERFULL MM. It snaps right into place underneath the bottom seams inside of th bag. It was a little hard to get it under the seams but that is the best way to ensure a secure fit. It does not slide around and it crystal clear. The protective plastic is a nice touch in the packaging. I almost didn't notice it had plastic to peel off, I could clearly see scratches on the plastic and I'm very glad they protected the acrylic base because it was flawless!",5
331108,"These gloves are great in cold weather, and like that they have a pocket in them to add those pocket warmers. Your hands stay warm and dry for hours. Since having frost bite on several fingers it is hard to find gloves to keep my fingers warm, but these gloves work great. No more freezing, painful fingers. Also the size is also correct, i wear a x/lg and the fit was correct. I plan on buying another pair just in case they stop selling them.",5
204720,"I had to try a few of these and return them before I finally found the one that was the right size, weight and width. This one is perfect for me! It's simple and durable. I don't have to worry about harming it doing my normal daily chores or routine.",5
180411,"Purchased this in both Black and Navy Blue. Wasn't sure I'd like them, but was instantly swayed when they arrived. I'm 5'9"" and slightly over 220 lbs., so I got a US L/Asia XXL and it fit great.

The material is a little different than I expected, but not in a bad way. I'm only giving four stars because the washing instructions are in Korean. I'll probably just hand wash the shirts in cold water and hang them up to dry.",4
254707,"I am giving this 2 star because it broke wen I tried to stretch it out. I am 5""4 and 125 pounds so I'm not big. I do have a long torso and there is very little give on top. I would recommend only for people that are short or have short torso and long legs. Any vertical stretching will not work with this. The fabric and design was good, just not for everyone.",2
470780,I just received my shirt today. I tried it on and it fits perfectly. I ordered a large. I am a busty girl so I was debating if I would need an XL.  It fits perfectly along my curves. It is cotton so it has stretch to it. It is not too short or too long on me. It is a good quality Fruit of the Loom shirt. The yellow color is the same color as pictured. Overall happy and I would recommend for any female Colombia fan!,5
467968,"I loved the way the material feels on this. I ordered a larger size on purpose because I like to have my outfits tailored to fit me perfectly. I did have to do some alterations to it besides the size. I also had to add a slip in the front so I could walk in it, but overall I am very happy with it. I wore it to the Pa Ren Fare this year and a few people knew who I was without the wig.",5
469813,"They are very small- almost too small to see. I did not measure them, but I guesstimate they are less than 4 mm in diameter.  I am a very petite woman and they look like I  took them from a baby.  The black jolly roger is light and the background is darker than shown.  You really can't tell what they are.  Very cheap, poor quality.  Don't waste your money.",1
696819,"This bathing cap is fun, retro and effective. I felt like the cap was a little tight around the edges. My daughter loves it and is not bothered by it at all.  I honestly think it was my hair bump that changed the fit. It is easy to get off and on, and the molded floral is really neat looking.

726091,This is a total disaster of a purchase. The sweater does not drape whatsoever. It is cut straight across along the bottom hem just like an old man's house sweater. This looks like more of something Mr. Rogers would where in his neighborhood than anything trendy like in the picture advertised. The pic is total false advertisement.,1
654402,These were horrible to try and put in. The plug is very soft and the hole it goes into is a really tight fit so trying to insert it and not have it bend was impossible. Also the ends of the plug were hardly bigger than the post itself. I returned them,1
133034,"Am a firm believer you get what u pay for. I love diamonds and couldn't resist the price for a pair of nice sized diamonds. Of course, for the price, one couldn't expect pristine, clear diamonds. Sadly, these have so many inclusions and grains in them they look really cloudy. However, I am enjoying them and what little sparkle they have, is appreciated. The posts are sturdy and quality.",4
274752,"After 1.5 years the spring in the buckle has gave out. Now the belt slips and doesn't work properly anymore. It was good while it lasted--it was easy to put on and take off compared to a ordinary belt--but it didn't last as long as I expect a belt to.

EDIT: Great customer service! The regular warranty is 180 days, and I had mine for 3 times as long. Yet they offered me a replacement because the first one didn't meet my expectations. I've upped my review from 3 stars to 4 to reflect this. I hope this one lasts longer.",4
859263,I received this earlier then expected. I was pleasantly surprised when I opened it. Although smaller then expected if you have 2 holes in one ear it would be perfect. I'm skeptical when it comes to jewelry because most look like you got it from the dollar store at this price. This is very elegant and doesn't look cheap at all they are very well made. I received this item at a discounted price for my honest review.,5

I do use a disposable diaper underneath at the public pool (because I am paranoid), but not in our pool.",5
636156,These are super cute but seem to run small. My son is is 34 months old and I ordered him a size 7 toddler. They barely fit with his toes crammed all the way to the tip of the shoe.

I'm excited because the whole suit is super cute and haven't really found any others on here I really want.  Great color.",5

I'm normally a size 4/6 this shirt possibly fits up to an 8.
The t-shirt is cotton but very soft. The shirt is feminine and the design is clever easy to stir conversation.
This can be worn in summer and cool evenings. I'm super happy and wish it came in other colors.
I highly recommend.",5

I did notice my others were made in Vietnam whereas this pair was made in China. Also couldn't them with the air holes pushed out. I had to do this myself with a red hot knife. Made a bit of a mess of it but they are still wearable. I won't be ordering these anymore because they are just not the same as before. Sorry.",2

Just a little to close to the bottom of the knee and a bit more wide than I anticipated. I prefer them more mid calf and tighter. They did feel great. There was a line down the center of each leg that you cant really make out in the picture, so they aren't completely smooth on the front. It is a bit wide and I felt they could do without it.",4

342741,"Just got it a week ago so I cannot speak of wear and tear yet,  but it's a lovely bag. The front of the bag is almost a suede texture, so soft.  The inside is a random pattern, doesn't really match the outside, but that's not important to me.",5
626707,The shorts were exactly what I ordered and were the perfect length for me compared to other shorts I have purchased as I am over six feet tall and finding shorts that come to or below the knees is not easy. The material is also of high quality and feels comfortable. I would definitely recommend the product to others.,5
318075,The shirt fits great! I'm 5' feet tall 108lbs and I bought the medium and it's perfect! Now the shirt isn't long though but Im ok with it. It's not short either it doesn't show my stomach when I lift my arms. It also has holes for your thumbs which I love too. It's very comfortable. It comes frome China and I got it in 2 and a half weeks which is great.,5
284159,This pin is everything you need to bring dank with you everywhere you go! Bringing my fianc&eacute;'s favorite meme into a tangible state was one of his favorite gifts I've gotten him in the 5 years we've been together. My only regret is not buying more than one. The only way I can think to improve this littlnfytkkkooo,5
546128,"I have only tried this on and its a second skin. I live bodcons but boy was this one tight. The fabric is super stretchy but not too cheap looking. I don't know what its called but there isn't much jersey or cotton in it. I don't wanna say its rubbery because it may come across as a pleather type material, which its not. I think it will a great for any slender girl with or without curves; avventuye if u have curves, create if u don't.",4
477072,"The pink is much brighter than it looks in the product picture, but I actually like it! It's very warm and long and sturdy. My ONLY complaint so far is that the pockets are weirdly placed, they are REALLY far back and uncomfortable to use. Otherwise, cute, comfy, love it!",4
622017,"I love this purse! I can already tell even after just a short time of using it that it will be one of my favorites! The quality is impressive and the design of this purse allows for a lot of space without having a huge purse to carry around, although this is slightly larger than I normally use. I plan to buy more of these as gifts!",5
866875,"I love this dress and will buy it in other colors.  It does need to be belted, as it has a strange seam in the middle that's not overly flattering.  However, adding a waist belt will help make the look.  I also bought a petticoat to go under it, which really makes it pop as a 1950's dress, however it looks great without the petticoat too.",4
316408,"Very high quality gloves, 80% Wool 20% Nylon Mix. Feels thick and conforms to the hands well.
Works alright with a smartphone screen. A bit ultra sensitive however. You will get a happy medium of thickness and dexterity, these are NOT ridiculously thick to the point where you can't use your fingers.",4
140876,"Exactly what I was looking for.  This length of watch band in this size is very difficult to find (even in jewelry stores), so I took a chance and bought 2 to have a spare.  I'm keeping the name of this seller for when I may need some in the future.",5
108920,"This costume runs tight in the pants.  My husband would have preferred a larger size if they had one.  He's 6'2"" and wears 34x34 pants usually.  The sleeves of the shirt were a little short also, but you can fix that if you have longer arms, by rolling up the sleeves or cutting the vest off and wearing it over a different shirt.  All in all, I liked the costume, but I do think we could have assembled the pieces and gotten the same look for less.",4
333120,"I just ordered this dress is coral and it is stunningly beautiful!! I read reviews that said the dress ran a little big so I ordered a size 8. My daughter is 8 and wears size 8 and 10 and the 8 fits her perfectly, if not just a tiny bit big. But this dress is gorgeous!! It looks like a mini prom dress and my eyes welled up in tears when my daughter tried it on.",5
692252,"I LOVE this nightgown!! I didn't expect a nursing nightgown to be sexy, but it is! Love the style, the fit is perfect (I'm typically a size small even though I'm on the busty side, and the small fit just right), I only wish it came in more than two colors because I would purchase more. Great price too!",5
40097,"I first bought a pair of these in a Jamaican airport. They were a little pricey compared to Walmart, etc, but they looked sturdy and fit great. They have been the best and I've worn them off and on almost 3 years. My new puppy finally chewed thru one of the straps. Believe or not, I fixed it by sewing it together w floss. But this purchase is my second pair and I expect them to do as well as the first! Puppy knows better now.",5
347681,"I really like the big face and the minimalist look to this thing.  I wear it every day and haven't had any issues yet.  At first I was planning on swapping out the cracked leather wrist band because I didn't think it looked good, but it actually looks a lot smoother than it does in the picture.  I ended up keeping it.",5
513997,"This was too large for me at XXXL, and the last suit I tried at XXL was too small. I am in-between sizes. At first I was unhappy because I would have to return it to China. But they refunded my order and gave a DE address in the US. So now I am satisfied.",4
430435,"The bag looks very pretty in the picture. I think the bottom is supported with a cardboard piece. I received the bag folded in half so the cardboard was bent already. I did not mind too much. However after less than a week of use the ""straw"" knitted pieces are coming apart everywhere. The bag is no longer usable. A canvas tote might have been a better pick for durability. Also the sequins snag your clothes. It is a desirable buy for it's cheap price, however it will only last one trip to the beach.",2
252815,I ordered this necklace and received a different one (two interlocked hearts). I honestly like the one I received more so I'm not upset. I'm rating this on the quality of the necklace because I'm sure they're the same quality. It hasn't turned my skin green and all of the rhinestones are sturdy. This is surprisingly well made for what it is. I received it for free from AMZ Review Trader.,4
433680,"Everything was great about this costume--except the chest portion. Come on, people. Just because you're a bigger girl does not mean you have 42FFF boobs. I bought this for my friend, she's a 40B, and I'm not kidding you, the boob part had to have been 6 cup sizes bigger than hers. I understand hers are probably small for her size, but I'm a 36DD and they were at least 3 sizes bigger than my girls. We had to tape the top to keep it from gaping.",3
696209,"Not for big chests. I purchased the XXL in hopes this would fit. I'm a 38D. The waist and length of the dress were fine, however the bust portion is very tight and short. Sadly this will be a return for me. If it was less expensive I would have altered the bottom into a lovely skirt. Over all it was very nice quality, just too small on top.",4
58784,I get so many compliments on this fan at parties. Used it on New Years Eve and it added to my outfit. It really does cool you down after a dance or if the space gets hot and has very little shedding.  The feathers that do shed are tiny. I keep it displayed on the dresser like a true diva should and it is a great accessory.,5
306571,"This shirt fit perfectly!!  Loved the casual shape and how soft the material was.  Unfortunately, I didn't notice in the picture that there were sparkly rhinestones on it which is not really my style so I returned.  Without the rhinestones, I would love this!  (And of course many people won't mind those!)",3
421897,"Wonderful colors and fit for a child not an adult as stated.  I read the reviews BEFORE purchase so I knew the sizing was stated incorrectly. I bought this for a child and was expecting it to fit a child and therefore I was very happy.  This size fit like a child's size 12 or a medium.  Otherwise, the colors on the shirt are vivid and really nice.",5
627698,"For the price, this is a cute little dress.  However, the sizes run very small.  I ordered an X-Large and the dress might fit a size 10.  For you small size ladies, you will enjoy the bargain of purchasing a new, stylish little dress so inexpensively.  The company was very understanding and agreeable in resolving the issue.  When I finally reach my weight loss goal, I will purchase from them again.",3
632957,Perfect fit. I ignored the reviews that said order size up and got a medium rather than a large because I didn't want the bottoms to be to big and the top fits perfect also :) its cute and as described . I see how others easily can put the fringe top upside down though so don't do that and you'll be fine . It will be great for one summer,5
860743,"I love how eye catching and bright this is. I usually wear smalls, but I purchased a medium so I could be sure that it was long enough to wear as a dress. The fabric is thin and soft, but not immodestly transparent. Mine had a bit more blue on it than the original picture,  but some variation is to be expected. Overall happy!",5
367570,"The material was cheap and it didn't not look as well as I expected. I am sending it back for another product.  I ordered a large and I got an xl which looked horrible on .  I also didn't like the way the dress fit even though it was too big, once I put it on I realize that I didn't like the way it looked on me.",1
810313,"* Jumpsuit arrived with the logo deeply wrinkled and crushed.
* Would have returned, but I bought it for a friend's birthday the next day. I turned suit inside out, spent a half hour trying to iron logo out as smooth as possible with moderate success.
* XXL was still too small in height for my friend when he tried it on, so he gave to his wife (Superwoman).
*Otherwise, this was cute and comfy,  medium weight fabric, cozy fleece",3
567666,"This suit is not at pictured! The quality is good but in my opinion it runs small. I wear a med and I ordered an XL and I could barely get it on and when I tried to zip it the zipper split. I have an hourglass figure and average size breast 34BC, I want to keep it but It doesn't fit well I will be returning. If you are petit you may have better success with this one. I'm tall 5'9 and it does not pull up all the way.",4
94756,"When wet this take blood looks very realistic, but on white clothing it dries pink. If you want your fake blood to stain your clothes, wear darker clothes for this fake blood. It does stain the skin a bit, but that's to be expected and comes off in a day or two.",4
540073,"This bra gets two stars because at least it's beautiful.  But how am I supposed to fit into this?  It's so tiny!  Waaayyy too small, in both the cup size and the band size.  If you really want this bra, order a size (or sizes) up.",2
5741,"My hope is that with the Canvas rather than the twill these will last a little longer.  Have the twill pant and while very comfortable were not as durable.  These should be a good addition to my work wardrobe for winter when a heavier pant is needed.  will still wear the twill in the Summer, as these may cause some unnessesary uncomfortablity with the weight of the fabric",4
393405,I ordered it a size larger due to the size of my bust and it was too large but not too badly. I returned it any way because the dress looked dull on me personally. The dark wine color didn't help either on me. The other dress I ordered looked much better on me.,4
319921,"Loved this purchase when I bought it about a year ago.

I was at a 6g looking for my first pair of stone plugs. These were awesome as I had every intention of sizing up and not one pair was the same size. Mystic metals is where I buy all my jewelry now at a size 2g and hoping to stretch to a 0 soon. See appt of comments saying they won't buy again because of sizing issues but when I bought them I was fully aware as usually you can pick your size and the headline literally reads 6g-4mm.",5
346292,"I absolutely love this dress. I first ordered it in a 2X since some reviews said it ran small but once it got here I ordered this dark green and in a Xl and it was perfect! I reordered the mustard yellow again in the correct size.
The fabrics is thick so I don't have to worry about the see through problem.
It also is hides the lumps & bumps because it's not that thin material. Great quality",5
173593,"The only thing I don't like about these boots is how the toe looks. Very round and a little goofy. BUT...I have done everything to include a 3 mile run in them, not by choice, and the didn't hurt my feet at all. as a matter of fact they felt like extreme high top tenis shoes.",4
307476,"This dress is perfect for the summer and I'm sure I will be wearing it after the baby as well! I am 26 weeks pregnant, 133lbs, 5ft, and 34B/32C cups. I am typically an XS/S. The small fits perfectly and it is the perfect length after I washed it and left it in the dryer on high heat for a while. Very versatile, great to wear to work with a cardigan, for a day/night out with the family and to lounge around at home, very comfortable! I get complimented all the time in this dress!",5
504491,I am an Image Consultant by trade and I have to say...this is a great jacket!  I get  a lot of compliments on it. Not for sub freezing temps but anything above that it keeps you warm. Looks great with nice pair of jeans as well as a pair of slim fit dress pants.,5
362994,"I like the shirt, but like others have said it's really short. I also don't know if I got a mix up or what, but the tag on mine says Ambiance, not JJ Perfection. It's cute, but you definitely need a shirt underneath by the way it's cut. Luckily I bought it to have a shirt underneath, but it's still short.",3
822638,"The quality isn't great. Would be a cute shirt if it looked like the picture. The shirt I received, the bow on the back is sad and doesn't look like a bow at all, it looks like someone accidentally sewed a piece of scrap fabric to the back. I know how to sew so I will fix it up myself so it looks nice. But I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Looks nothing like the picture shown.",2
778125,"I was a bit skeptical at first about how low the price was, and expected somewhat low quality product in exchange, but took a chance and I'm so glad I did. Immediately after placing the order, Jane emailed me asking for my custom measurements. I ordered on 2/19 and received it 3/12 with expedited shipping, which was 4 days before the earliest expected delivery date. The only issue I have is the shoulder/bust area is a bit baggy, but otherwise everything is near perfect. Would definitely order again!",5
780618,"I absolutely love the quality and texture of the fabric.  The pajamas are very soft,  comfortable and stylish.  I am a size small but found that the small fit was very snug,  so if you prefer a looser fit, I suggest going a size up. The seller was very professional and quick to respond when I contacted them to exchange the pyjamas for a larger size. So far I've bought three Suntasty pajamas and I'm happy with all of them.",5
230924,"I have seen some negative reviews that stopped me from purchasing these until I just decided to get them. I am glad I did. They are comfortable, the XL size fits right, it's nice around the private area and they feel great and the design is nice. The inner lining surprisingly did not bother and actually felt like it kept everything in place in the man regions. Plus shipping was fast. I'm going to buy again in a different style.",5
524601,I absolutely LOVE this ring! I've gotten plenty of complements on this ring that my husband got for me as a wedding ring...I'm not one for expensive rings so when he told me the price for this one I was happily in shock because of how gorgeous and real it looks! Fits me perfectly and still looks amazing after having it for almost a year already.,5
819034,"Love the weight of this skirt. It is lightweight without being sheer. The length is perfect and the skirt is true to size. If you are in between sizes and are not sure which way to lean, the skirt fabric stretches nicely, so you will not have any trouble opting for the smaller size.",5
38422,"I bought several pairs of these.  My husband has Alzheimer, and I use only these for him..  They have no pockets, zippers or other colors so he's never confused and they're always the same.  Much easier than the jeans he used to wear, though we did have to wean him off those.",5
777866,"LOVE this dress!
I wear it for a nightgown...The material is SOOO comfy!!
Super quality!
It IS short....I am 5'6"" and 150lbs, and it covers my rear, but only by a few inches.
It fits great in the shoulders, waist, etc, and the tie is perfect.
Love it!
I have received this item at a discount for my honest, unbiased review...5 stars for Doublju!",5
869602,These are so cute!! Im 55 and 160 pounds and ordered a size large and they fit great. They don't dig into my waste and seem like they will stay up great and are very flattering. They will look super cute with a bikini top or A tankini if you like having a little tummy control under your suit!,5
649526,I have 3 of these now.  One for every handbag that I use the most. I don't have all my stuff going right to the bottom of my handbag.  Now I can find everything. Just be careful about putting too much in it cause you handbag will get heavy. This holds a lot and keeps everything really organized.,5
572199,"Ordered this for a grown up Minion fan for Christmas. It's really cute and I think she'll love it. Was kind of ""stuffed"" in the packaging and I opened and refolded. It's also a weird kind of soft and it fit me (also a grown up) a little snug. Will let you know how she likes it.
12/17/15 - She loved it! Would definitely buy again.",5
393015,This body jewelry piece is very beautiful and the pictures online don't do it any justice. It is even more beautiful in person and comes packaged in a nice box with a letter from the company to you about the product and any FAQ's that you may have. I did have to adjust the links a bit to fit me due to my small size but it works beautifully and I can't wait to wear!  I would definitely recommend and be purchasing more!,5
555609,"Fits as expected, very spandex and stretchy like around the waist. I'm almost 6 feet tall, male, and I got a medium, I weigh 215-220 lbs, with some love handles, and they are perfect, not tight at all whatsoever. A bit short, but that is my fault on measuring myself, next time instead of 10 inch inseams, I'll get 12 inches. But I like that it's short too, so it doesn't get in the way of my knees when I workout. A+ shorts. Champion is always a top tier brand.",5
581271,ladies be truthful to your body type . this will only look cute on if you are a small or medium built with no round pronounced belly. .  it only looks good when it hangs on you.and if you have a round pronounced belly forget about it .I ended  up taking the those black sleeves and bottom lining off and fixed them to a different sweater  it looks great now !. but not every one is betty homemaker.,3
552380,"Beautiful handbag. Perfect for fall. Large enough for everyday carry item (wallet, keys, large sunglass case, water bottle, kindle, small makeup bag, small note pad, small bottle of hand lotion) my cell phone fits in back pocket for easy access. It could also fit a small umbrella, but it would stick out the top.  It is structured, but not overly heavy. It is the most expensive handbag I've ever bought, but I got a bonus at work and this was a gift to myself. I also got $80 off buying on Amazon. I am very happy with my purchase.",4
100099,I bought this passport wallet to use for my upcoming travel and it fits my passport and credit cards well.  It is very easy to get my passport in and out at passport control which helps to save time and to get it back in and secure after passing through.,5
426432,"The kit arrived quickly and is very nice. There is plenty of room and I appreciate that it can fold out to hold even more items. I agree with other reviews that given the price, I thought the leather might be a bit thicker. It definitely feels like genuine leather, but is still relatively slim. Overall, I am pleased.",4
626603,"I purchased the XS for my 11 year old son (he is tall 5.6"") but slim. It fit him well. He loves it! I love the quality of the material. It came with 2 extra buttons ... which might be useful since those buttons do stick out a little, so might be prone to being caught.",5
321317,"It says fits between size 2-8 but not for a muscular build.  I'm 5ft at 125lbs, takes a size 2 or 4 in bottoms and small to medium in tops. It was too fitted in the arms and back. I figured I would be able to fit it comfortably; have some looseness since it says fits up to size 8 but not.  It's nice red material but the white fluffy parts sheds. Unfortunately, I'm sending it back.",3
678667,"Pros:
1. Decent quality
2. Workmanship was as expected
3. Eye padding is helpful

Cons:
1. A little on the thin side but plastic quality was okay...a little better than cheap Halloween masks
2. More expensive than it should be, but then again, it is ""Star Wars"" merchandise
3. Masks may be a little small for larger adults

Conclusion: Basically, something to just have fun with...Not a bad item for a party or photo booth; should last for a couple of events; not designed for serious costume wearer.",3
555444,"these little "" snow"" booties are even cuter in person and they were a hit at Christmas.  I recommend these highly. Price is more than reasonable and they look to fit just about right. The zipper in back made my daughter in law very happy, have you ever tried to put shoes on a newborn?  PLease buy these for your special little girl~ you won't regret it! I promise!",5
113863,"Purchased these for my 7-yr old, who loves earrings but has no interest in getting them actually pierced.  Magnets are strong enough to stay on her ears through running around, cartwheels, etc.  She can wear them about 3-4 hrs before she says her ears hurt and takes them off.  She loooooved all the colors.  Very happy!",5
327246,"i bought this for my beautiful wife, since she says I'm to old to be playing basketball because i always end up getting hurt somehow. so i decide to get this particular outfit because i need a nurse in times of need. spice it up people, never stop dating your significant other, keep it fun and your relationship will last a life time.",5
158322,"I bought these for my son for Christmas because it had dropped below 30 degrees in California and we were all scrambling for warmth.  I got caught with wind in my ears one morning, and got the idea to give these for gifts to friends and family.  These were for my very snazzy-dressing son, who loved them!",5
677118,Cute backpack but awful quality...the fabric on both of the pockets ripped across the entire seam within the first few days of using it & the canvas on the bottom already has a hole in it. I don't throw my backpack around at all and have only used it lightly with hardly any weight in it. Not worth it.,2
781221,"Great prices , love the fact thats internationally threaded  and perfect size. Even measured it to make sure. Only issue I have is that the gold tunnels are no where near a gold...kinda disappointing. Those are the theee colors o wear most , gold , silver and black. Other than that they are perfect.  It almost like its a rose gold. Cant match with my chain. I took a picture of my old gold gauges to compare. Huge difference",3
734159,"Love the texture, so smooth. Fits around my belly but is large in the arms and falls to low off my shoulder for it to have a nice look out in public. Probably be a shirt to lounge in more so. Pretty sure I ordered a medium, no tag even on it to say asize so not sure what I got.",2
63168,Its a cute costume except I should've listened to the reviews before buying... the top part was a bit big and the boot covers kept falling off when I tried it on. I couldn't wear it for Halloween unfortunately. I should've ordered a size smaller :( Maybe I will do that next year.,2
425537,"I had a Bella Taylor purse in browns and blacks and cream exactly like this and loved it. When I saw the beautiful spring colors, I couldn't wait to get it.  I don't need a wallet any more with all the pockets inside the zippered side. I get to all the essentials easily.  The pocket holds my phone.  It's the perfect size for me.",5

Within two days of wearing these insoles, my plantar fasciitis was almost completely gone. I no longer suffer from this debilitating pain, and I am free to get out of bed without fear of hurting. These Powersteps were money well spent.",5
270176,"If I could give it zero stars I would. Instantly returned it.

Measurements absolutely not as advertised. I'm 5'6"" 140lbs with a small chest, I ordered a large based on other reviews that it runs small. It was so small it didn't even fit as a shirt. 'Large' must mean they cut it wider but don't increase the length, this could maybe fit a stocky box. The material is cheap and the seams are very poorly placed, a thick seam runs down the front and back of the 'dress'.",1
118345,"See this wonderful big top pictured? Don't believe it! Knowing that brands from the Orient frequently run small,  I carefully checked the measurements provided. I noted it said it was the equivalent to a U.S. size 12, which is my size.  But when it arrived and I tried it on,  It fit like a tee-shirt. The shirt would be adorable if it fit as pictured. Only a very tiny person would achieve the look pictured.",2
320265,"This fell apart after one wear,  and I use the word ""wear"" loosely . It did not last a half hour. Basically I put it on drove to work and it fell apart when I sat at my desk. Granted, this thing is cheap, so I'm out 2 bucks. Just save yourself the 2 bucks and don't bother. It only gets one star because you have to give it a rating otherwise it would get zero stars. No stars for you.",1
403019,"I was having a HUGE problem finding maternity pants that wouldn't fall down and these really helped. I do wish they were adjustable (some pants sit lower than others, so it would be nice to have the option to extend or shorten as needed) and I'm finding the elastic is wearing already. However, for the price, they are totally worth it if you are having the same issues.",3
416828,"I was travelling abroad and was looking for a gift that will represent native american craft, be affordable, attractive and would not take up space in my suitcase. I found all these qualities in this cute pendant. I bought 7 of them, both kinds (heart and bear), I loved them both equally, and everyone who received them, was delighted.",5
295836,"Ok this was a way more successful transaction than I thought. In so glad I decided to spend money on something from China! This company is great. I knew to order a few sizes larger & I'm usually a small so I got this in large. Omg so cute! It fits perfectly & I can't wait to wear it! Shipping only took 2 weeks too. For this price though the quality of the top is thin, it's so worth it.",5
460711,"Great product, especially for the price! The mesh lining makes it thin enough to wear on a warm rainy day, and its loose fitting enough to layer up for the cold ones. The sleeves have adjustable straps to keep water from blowing up them, and to prevent unnecessary and annoying movement on your arms. The hood is adjustable as well. It will keep you dry and you will look great in the meantime.",5

Shipping was SO fast!",5

I ordered a medium but it fits like a small (which is the size I normally wear). The cut is perfect and it covers my bra straps perfectly. The material feels so soft. I love this tank top.
I received a discount on this item in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.",5
306132,Hey I really like these.  I wasn't sure. I've been trying to find the right fit and comfort.  But these are really cool.  They are little bigger in the knees.  But what I like is they are tight and constrict in the waist.  The design is really cool.  It looks even better in person. These will be great to do my walks in the morning when it's cold.  Glad I bought. Good price.,4
103678,I ordered an XL the sent XS. Since the product comes for Japan it was not worth the hassle to send back. I politely messaged seller informing them of the error and they told me I was wrong even though the price I paid matched the price of an XL. This seller was rude and not helpful at all.  To top it off even if the shirt was the right size it looks like something made in a high school Home Economics class.,1
238150,"Fit as expected: meaning I expected it to run small because it's from China. I'm 5'3, 125 lbs, 34D. The EXTRA LARGE fits perfect. Arrived sooner than I expected. Bottoms are not lined, but black so it's ok. Also the turquiose color in the picture is NOT as prominent on the actual suit, In fact there is hardly any turquiose on the suit. I do like the swim suit and I will wear it, but I am slightly disappointed in the appearance. Hopefully it will look better with a tan.",3
410504,"I finally got to order this beauty and was very pleased when it arrived.  The high quality cubic zirconia combined with the white gold leads to amazing light reflection.  I have paired it with a three row band from Sonia Jewels and it is absolutely stunning.  Once again they have hit it out of the ball park.  Would love to post picture, I would be happy to email one at any time so you can see how well the two pair together, it's like they were made for each other.",5
566420,"This is way too big. Love the design but due to sizing will not reach for it as often as I had hoped. Due to the size it is much lower cut on me than pictured, so will need to wear a camisole or mock turtle neck with it. Great length for leggings but the sleeves, trunk and decollete are sized too large.",3
215521,"I should have paid more attention to other reviews.  I ordered my usual XL, and it was just too big.  But I loved the feel of the fabric so much I decided to use the original one to sleep in, and order a size down.  It fits perfect, and feels so good against my skin.",4
33025,"I love that jacket and it looks great one me. But there are 2 missing braided leather strings for my both arms and it looks really ""s*** "" so I took out from both sides and put on both arms. It looked much better. I wrote to seller and they never never  respond.  Maybe they ignored me.  What disappointing!!",4
396622,"These are super cute and seem to be made well. Just holding them, they feel nice and heavy duty, not cheap and thin like others. They are meant as a gift and havnt been given yet so I can't vouch for their durabilty. But I can add that they shipped and arrived very promptly.",5
707130,I must be dumb.  I have a 36 inch waist and ordered the same size.  This barely fits to first hole on belt.  I am learning certain things simply cannot be ordered on-line.  This is another on the list.  I am very disappointed and cannot be bothered with packing it up and returning.  My ADD does not let me focus on something so petty.,1
431768,"Sexy and well put together. Love it. This has enough sparkle to turn any head. The jeweled piece stops just above 'the action' to allow... whatever you have in mind. Be careful wearing any outfit that covers it, like say a teddy or camisole. The material will snag on the little metal braces that hold the facets in place. Be mindful and pull it away carefully to avoid ripping, or wear nothing but the T-Back ;)",5
423098,"If you aren't afraid to show some leg, it is a very funny costume. It is a lifeguard outfit so the shorts are short but they fit. The jacket fits as well and gave me free range (I wore it in an 80s themed kickball game with no problems). I'm 6'2'' 200 lbs and 34 waist for reference. I would estimate this is basically a medium in terms of size. It doe not come with the flotation device as pictured though.",4
157001,"I am not sure how or why other buyers left such great feedback. Item is very cheap in appearance, states amethyst but it is not. It appears glued together, I purchased more than 15 and I am forced to toss them out. The pictures are far nicer than the actual product, not a proper representation. The seller extremely unhelpful. I would recommend purchasing this from another seller.",1
457679,"I ordered my normal size XL, but these were labeled large on the tag inside the pants, and xl on the bag.  But this was like a youth xl.  It wasn't even close to a womens size even if they were a large.  I returned them for a refund, and they were really good to work with.  No issues with ease of returning it.",3
213827,"I usually wear a size large, but when I saw the reviews about the legs being too short, I ordered a 1x/2x thinking it would surely be long enough. Legs were not long enough and are very uncomfortable.  Buyers, please take heed when we say the legs are too short!",2
837603,"I knew these would run small, so I took a chance. I ordered a xs for my 10 year old daughter.  It fits her perfectly and looks so cute.  This fits her style, and she absolutely loves it.  It seems to be well made too.  I ordered blue, and I think I will order another color soon.",4
533204,"It comes in one size and that size is small--lucky for me it fit! I had spent a few weeks in local shops looking for a skirt like this and gave up and went online. I don't like buying clothes because of sizing and fit. The slits go up almost to the hip but I love it and so does my boyfriend!

Material is a little thin though.",4
4073,Dress was very nice for the money. Actually it didn't even look like a costume it looked like the real thing.  Well worth the money.  I wear a size 10 but ordered a small and it fit.  Had a lot of compliments on it at our Roaring 20s Dance.  Will come back if I ever need another costume.,5
103893,I bought this for myself for our wedding. inside the package came a hand written note with something special on the backside of the garter...a little blue bow. it is a heavy garter but they also sent some fashion tape to help hold it up. well worth the price which was cheaper than i imagined. would highly recommend to others when they are looking for garter belts.,5
608430,I had super quick wedding ceremony and wanted to get some kind of veil to feel that it was still a wedding. I actually bought it last minute and wasn't expecting it to work as well as it did so I'm happy. Everyone loved it and made nice comments abt it.,5
463239,"It is not what I expected. It is large and on the inside is fabric that does not allow the hat to fit against your head, causing its wearer to look similar to one of the British Guards. It's made of a material that doesn't allow the hat to form well to the head. I'm disappointed because I was so excited to wear it, but it would look more ridiculous not because it's a Pokmon, but because of how it is made and the way it fits the head.",1
666936,"Finally a sun shirt that actually looks feminine!  The pros - cinches nicely at the waist, you can open the zipper to get some cooler air.  It helps to get it wet to stay cool when it's super hot outside.  The only con, and this is true of most sun shirts, is that if it is very hot outside, the shirt doesn't breathe so well and feels hot.  That's why hopping in the pool or ocean is a good idea and keeping it wet to keep cool.",5
795643,"I went by the ordering standard listed in the drop down and ordered size 8-10(XL). The sizes are very hit or miss some times so I decided to just go with what it said. My chest is 36C, waist 28, hip 38 (pear shaped, athletic build). The top is honestly much too large, but I am hoping it will shrink a bit. The bottoms fit very well and are some of the most flatttering I own right now. I ordered the white bottoms with the strappy sides. Over all not bad for the price.",4
32422,"I bought these to keep feet warm at night.  Not safe in bed, the package, (but not the ad), says.  Also, the tiny warm patch that comes ONCE with slippers works ONCE says package.  ORDER more warm pads, for $5 EACH, and you can use these 5 more times!!!!!",1
253339,"Beautiful leather wristlet. I love the option of fitting my iPhone plus 7 along with several slots for credit cards/cash and can even fit a small lipgloss. I also like that the middle zipper has a pocket for change. Very durable, I love the rose color and I like the option of the pretty decorative tassel. I would highly recommend!",5
82840,"What can I say, but I LOVE THIS HAT!  It looks great and fits very well.  I ordered the XXL because I'm a big guy and usually have a hard time finding something that fits me well.  But this thing was perfect, even for my 25 inch around noggin.  It bent into shaped nicely also, and keeps it's form.  I have a feeling this hat is going to be with me for a long time.",5
875518,"I rarely write bad reviews, but this product warrants one. When I opened the package, there was thread everywhere. There were seams hanging off the swimsuit, the black part of the swimsuit bottom was scrunched up and not sewn well. The cover top was poorly made and resembles one of those ""ordered it from China"" fails you sometimes see on social media. This is an overall unsatisfactory product and I will be returning it promptly.",1
69453,"This is a great product - provides good support after a c-section. The doctors and nurses were even impressed! However, I can't give 5 stars because it's too big. I measured myself according to Belly Bandit's website, and the chart determined I needed a size medium (which seemed accurate with my average build). I am 12 days post surgery and I almost have the velcro maxed out. I'm bummed out because I was planning on wearing it for the next couple months, and the flaps of the overlapping section doesn't fit/look right under clothes.",3
439078,"I bought this shirt for my son.  I tried to follow the sizing chart and made my best guess as to what size to purchase.  Well, the shirt arrived, I love the print, but it is way too small.  It looks like a shirt that I would have bought for a 5 year old! I am definitely returning this and will try to find something else.",3
183586,"This is a great little nose ring!! I had no troubles getting it in like I have with other screw type nose rings and I love how sparkly the little crystal is!
It is a bit longer then a normal nose stud  but not too long.. .I feel like this baby will not fall out!
 I would definitely repurchase!",5
535290,"I love the look of this, I have it with a green stone.  However, when it came, it was in pieces inside the plastic packaging.  I fixed it, but frankly it was a pain, the  links kept falling off, as I was attempting to put them back on.  Some of the links had very little to bend back in place which made it very hard to tighten.  So far, so good, but who knows  - I'll have to wait and see.  Not happy with it.",2
800997,"Even though the shoes ran a little too large/wide, I liked them.  They are pretty ""little girl"" shoes (and that's becoming very hard to find).  They were a little closer to a cream than white, but still worked with her dress.  If you get the sizing right, you'll be pleased.",4
127811,"Cheaply made as you can tell from the cheap paint they slapped on the 'belt' & buttons on the actual jumpsuit. The mask is bloody awful lol there's a weird sponge kinda protecting you from scratching your eyeballs out that literally came off the first time I tried on the mask, & you can barely see out of the eyes anyways because it's tinted! Overall I'm fairly disappointed in this product, it's crappy & cheap. Please DON'T waste your money on this",2
435873,"This one was not what I expected.  Pic shows a long fitted tee.  Mine is short and wide.  The emblem is on the center of shirt, not top.  The yellow is not bright and vivid either.  More a dull urine colored yellow.  It's not horrible.  Just not near as cute as pictured.  Was bummed.
Ended up buying something different to wear.",2
392772,very bad and cheap packaging. The case had 2 deep cuts on it due to mishandling. The material is also very cheap and flimsy. I don't mind the material as you get what you pay for  but the cuts on it due to mishandling should not be included in the package.,2
407769,"I have bought that boxer swimsuit with a tiger print. I am surprised by the wonderful feeling of my skin with that fabric. It has got a prominent pouch that makes a stunning profile too! It is good as a jogging boxer and as a swimsuit boxer. The tiger print is not exactly a ""tiger"" but it seems more to a brown camoflage print. The size Medium fits as described and it doesn't fit smaller.",3
697333,I was very excited when my backpack arrived 2 weeks early! It's well made inside/out and exactly how I pictured.  My only wish was that it was bigger so I could use it as my commuter/laptop bag. The only real bummer was it arrived with a good size dent in the bottom corner from shipping (see photo).  My hope is that it flattens out or I won't use it at all. I would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for the dent.,3
283288,Cute swimsuit but the top is way too big.  I tried to go off the size chart they had and peoples reviews.  I got a size 6-8Large and the top is way too big for me.  I am 130lbs 57 and a small B cup bra.  The bottoms fit gold so Im afraid if I get a Medium the bottoms will be too small. Will be returning.,4
330340,"Sexy. fits good. not expect used many times look fragile, but is so good for one or 2 nights of fun, I don't know if good for nigh out depend how open is the person who used could looks almost naked, nothing wrong with that, but depends from person to person.",5
713031,This was a gift. My daughter loves it and says it's really nice and warm. I got it online mostly because there wasn't a pink one similar to this any place in the whole county. I'm glad I did it was a success and a quality coat at a great price.,5
310654,"This is definitely a very great waist trainer. I wear a size S/M in tops and ordered the S which at first I was a little hesitant thinking I should have ordered a M but after I tried it on I new it was the right size. It shapes my body and has shaped my body beautifully. It is not long or short in length, just exactly what I needed.",5
86104,"WARNING: Everything you've heard about these boots running small is TRUE.  I may need to return them.  I usually wear a 10.5+, and I ordered an eleven, but I can barely get my hobbit feet past the entrance of the boot where the tongue is.  The tongue area doesn't expand very far so I may need to send them back.  Plus, they seem a little narrow if you're wearing thick socks.  But the quality of the boot is first rate.",3
442542,"The small size packing cubes were larger than I imagined.  I used one bag for each of my children's shirts and underwear for our recent 4 day trip.  My children are size 5, 3T and 24 months.  They worked perfectly, the boys were excited to each have a bag and my luggage was organized. I will be buying more in larger sizes for more upcoming trips.",4
140534,"when I first unwrapped these,i thought they would fit a 9 year old.i decided to try them on anyway.they are like pantyhose,they look small but the STRETCH to fit my 5 10'' body. very warm and very comfortable,they are not too binding in the waist.i love them and will order more as Christmas gifts.and for myself,too!",5
413853,"Love these boots I usually wear a 8.5 in womens so I ordered size 6 and they fit perfect.  I wore these boots for tactical training,  I was standing out in desert from 9am to 9pm and my feet were comfortable the whole day.  I use them for hiking 4-7miles on weekends and very comfortable.  I've used these for my GoRuck events and they worked out great for me also",5
806803,"Such a cute shirt! A good quality fabric, the truck looks like it's sowed on which is cute! The buttons on the side are nice and makes for much easier dressing! This shirt is so cute and my 3 year old loves it, recommend this product!

509807,"I love this type of dress on me! Very flattering. Hits at my knees but I'm only 5ft. This is my 2nd purchase & waiting (patiently) on my 3rd to arrive. The only thing I don't like is it is shipped from China so it takes about 10 days,seems forever when I'm anxious, for it to arrive! Great dress!",5
68621,I ordered two different sizes for my 7 month old. The sizes are definitely NOT infant sizes even though it says so. My son's foot slipped out of both size 4 and 5 even though he wears a size 4. The style of it makes the heel fit away from his foot so it's not flushed to his foot. This makes it so that his foot slides right out. Returning.,1
676900,Ordered xl originally. Then emailed and said L would be better. Company emails me back No problem we will make the changes before it is shipped. Still received and Xl with a broken tie to hold up pants. So now Im left with a useless set Too Big sweat pants. ,2
249982,"Bought the 1-2yr old size for my son who is 2yr3months. Still way too big. However, even when it's big it's impossible to put it on and have his thumb in the right spot. Missed the window for return so I guess I'm keeping these, maybe my son can try them again next winter?",1
28907,"I am so happy with these insoles.  I've always had problems with my feet - flat feet/fallen arches - and I've tried insoles of various kinds.  Most of them helped a little, but these insoles made all the difference. They are comfortable and fit my shoes well.  I transfer them from one pair to another, but I am going to purchase more so I don't have to do the transferring.  They have worn well, and I do a lot of walking.  I highly recommend them.",5
46261,"As with most other stockings, thick legged girls may have trouble with these as ""one size"" works until the thigh. If you have big thighs like me, you may have to cut the tight bit at the top to allow your legs some breathing room. The product itself is okay, though the fabric is thin and obviously not the most durable. Just treat the stockings nicely and they shouldn't rip.",4

Because you can't not were it next day because it will be wet next morning  from all the sweat. You next an extra one. You will start sweating from the second of trying it. Comfortable to were.

I am 5 2"" currently 160lb at 36.5 weeks and the one I bought was medium.  It would fit someone larger too.  There is a sizing image to the far left of the page, use that not the 'size chart' that is directly below the price.",5
259786,"This is a great top, and I got it in brown, because the picture seems more taupe than true brown. However, it is a true brown, not super dark, and not a very pretty one at that (it's reminds me of baby poo, lol).  However if you like brown, then buy it because the fit is awesome!  I'm going to get more in other colors because it's long (I need that at 5'10"") and the XL is a true XL, not Asian XL.",5
709259,"I first ordered the normal size my daughter would wear, which is medium. That was too small. We returned it and bought the large. That was perfect. The cotton is nice and soft. It's not a heavy hoodie, but for the price we did not expect it. But, I can tell you, my daughter was VERY happy with it. She's got it in two colors, black and brown.",5
397910,"I have owned a pair of these for years and love them.  They fit great under my helmet and fit my face great.  However,  if it is a very cold or windy day, my forehead is not protected so I prefer my traditional goggles to keep my forehead warm.",5
394636,Fits perfect for a 120lb weight girl. I however have a little problem with the design at the top. Could problem use more material there so the bow has a better feel and look. Think it looks better on camera than in person.  My husband loves it still. Oh! It will definitely show of those curves.,4
733819,I have had a hard time with silicone tunnels either being too thin and caving in while wearing or not being true to size. These are great and extremely comfortable. I bought a tapering it along with these to go from 1/2 to 9/16 my only problem was that my ears were already to big from wearing heavy plug's.  Ordered 5/8ths the next day because they are great. The flare makes them larger looking but  like that in tunnels,5
338753,I was excited when this came in the mail. I didn't expect much because of the price. Its really cute but i cant wear it because they messed up on the clasp it has 2 of the same pieces and won't close. For the price i paid im not gonna deal with sending it back,1

These FTL breathable briefs are just different enough to satisfy, but traditional enough not to alienate.  It just takes a few washings to get the material to break in and feel very nice.  Based on the purchase of one bundle, I later bought two more.",4
84892,"Shipped fast, arrived carefully wrapped. It fits as expected. I got a L and it is a bit big and loose however it does look great. you can wear it over leggins (i am 6') and it looks like an oversized dress sweater or over a sexy dress when you need to wait until you get into the club.

My BF loves this on me and the zippers on top are great, my long hair has not gotten caught in them just FYI. I wear them half way down over my shoulder to show my tattoos. i would buy again!",5
837968,"I'm always afraid that things will be too small but  I could have gone down a size. I'm a size 20, so I ordered the biggest one. It's not gonna fall down, just a little loose for swimwear.

The top does not have 2 hooks in the back, only the one. I may have to alter it a bit and ditch the pads but for the price it's worth it.",4
728884,"Never ordered suits from this maker before. Although I have ordered literally DOZENS of suits from Amazon. But I have to say, this one was the best fit yet. Only alteration needed was the hem on the pants. It was close, but my tailor was able to give me a 34"" hem with a cuff. Any longer would not have worked. I believe I will be ordering from them again soon.",5
814430,"Although I usually wear a size 2X for comfort, based on reviews of this shirt, I ordered a size 3X. I am very disappointed with the fit. I do like the fabric and color, so I will wear the shirt when I also have a jacket on the cover the ""snugness.""",3

427205,"When I received them they fit me perfectly, unfortunately they were intended to be a gift for my husband.

So the person who brought this shirt, has one that barely fits and the person with the 2x is swimming. Also be aware that in the picture its a violet shirt with lilac flowers and blue/green leaves. But in person the flowers are almost bright pink, the shirt is more of a royal/eggplant purple making it too ""girly"" for most men.",3
727476,"Soft and well knitted strong. Cable knit is attractive but not bold.  It is light weight so great for spring, summer, and early fall. It looks great with a dressier look. I am  pleased to have this as part of my wardrobe and expect from the quality for it to last for years.",5
450619,"I was going to spend a bunch of money on a costume for a costume party we were having our home but instead I decided to go with this.  It had the top, bottom and a headdress all in one.  Everything fit well and the headdress was decent.  I did cut the legs off the bottoms to turn them into shorts because it was extremely hot that day and suddenly everyone thought  I looked like Barney Rubble.  If you're on a budget and need an all in one then this costume will do.",4
98816,"It is a very handsome satchel, beautiful color, roomy with  look of genuine leather.  However, attached straps definitely too short to use as shoulder bag, especially if wearing a coat, and extra strap works well only for cross-body use.  I was hoping there would be rings on either end of bag for attaching the strap, so it could be comfortably carried as a shoulder bag. Not so.  The other thing I am not too certain about is the bag's odor, especially inside.  My reason for returning this  item is strictly a personal preference issue.",4
129097,"It's worth what I paid for, but not any more. It's obviously ""pleather.""  Some purses and wallets are difficult to tell, but this is definitely lower end. Nonetheless, I do like it. I'm giving it to my daughter, because it's a little funky that way. But, you could pay more, even at Target or Walmart for it. So, it's an okay purchase.",4
721473,"I was a skeptical person regarding this product, I really wasn't sure if it could hold everything I carry with me in that tiny purse but it's holding up well and the front pocket holds my bulky cell phone with case (not the iPhone 6+ but just as big) and I must say it's doing a good job! I might buy another style later!",5
685389,I normally purchase a large on top so I ordered a XL it was somewhat loose which was fine in a way because its better than being too small (which triggered me to buy a size up). the fabric wasn't stiff and it is very comfortable to wear. I bought this top to wear at my wedding because it is a casual thing and this top will look great on my special day.,4
260801,"I ordered my normal size and they were too big... For reference I have a 25""w and 35"" hips ... Not that I could actually properly try them on as they had NO button hole openigs! I know I could easily open them myself with s knife, but I'm not sure I should have to.. Aside from that they were actually ok shorts, and I would return them anyway aside from the size and buttons because they aren't as high up on the waist as I'd expected",3
454811,"This item was listed as a C cup on the website and the packaging.
It seemed true to size however it did not fit in the bikini top I received which was labeled as a C cup but turned out to be a medium.
I may keep these as they fit into another bikini top that I have (size large)",3
458076,"I ordered a small because they do not offer a XS.  Everyone say the ""China sizing"" runs small, but this fit perfect.  I am 5'4"", 110 lbs, small chested if that helps the other ladies.  It fits beautifully!  I am very pleased with it.  You will have to wear a slip.  It is thin material, but it is considered a summer dress.",5
310637,This fit me and I am a size XL but this is not really for people with a long torso. It is really uncomfortable in the back because it folds up all the time and it doesn't even barely go over my belly button. So if you are shorter this is a great one but if your tall and have a long torso its not great....,3
491788,"the yellow is eye popping, fit is exactly as noted so a size 0-2 women wears a small in this.  IT does stretch, so you can go smaller, but I think that would tug in the wrong places.  I ordered white and  also blue too.  The yellow is by fatr the best looking, You should order one, then once you see it, order another same size or smaller if you want.",5
257264,"I like this, its just I need a little support in the chest area as I am small and not with implants and this swim suit has not support. It lays over your check flattening them. the wrap around for me squeezed a little causing rolls more then normal as it wraps around.  the bottoms fit great. the color was a little opaque could be deeper more saturated. it would probably fade with one wash easily.",3
404312,"My husband lost his wedding ring at work.  (He is a truck driver and does unloads, so it's physical.)  I bought this ring just for him to wear at work, thinking we would replace his ""good"" ring later.  (Right at Christmas, money was a little tight.)  He likes this ring so much he is not planning to buy another gold band!  The titanium seems to hold up better than the gold did.  He has been wearing it for about one month.  Thanks so much!",5
11070,"I have had very bad plantar fasciitis for months.  I have tried different shoes, different insoles. Heat cold differnt pain relievers with nothing helping.  Some major brands made the problem worse.  The berkenstock insoles have made a major improvement.  In just three days of use I fell so much better.  I strongly recommend this product!",5
73907,"For $10 I wasn't expecting much and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of these sun glasses.  I read the reviews after I purchased so was a little nervous that they may be tacky. I like the size,  the fit and they seem to be good quality.

The frames are in perfect condition.  The lenses look sturdy.  They didn't slip and they fit tight on the ears.  I have no complaints at all.",5
46343,"I purchased this hat for my little boy who loves Puss in Boots.  It was reasonably priced and although didn't advertise as a ""Puss in Boots"" hat or even for a child, it is black and has a feather! It is big on him, of course, but adds to the adorable costume look. It was packaged well and arrived in perfect condition. My little boy is a happy guy...hopefully the foam sword I purchased separately won't get him into too much trouble!",4
196487,"My daughter loves this backpack. She looked at hundreds of backpacks on the web, and in target, kohls, macys, and found this one. The size is perfect for a 7-10 year old girl, and it is really cute. The handle is well made and will hang on a hook well.",5
789505,"Absolutely beautiful earrings. I had doubts about the quality, however, when they came the quality was impressive. They are on the heavier side ina  good way. The color is BEAUTIFUL. It's not a deep red, but more so of a bright red with an orange/pink undertone. Kind of like a fire color. I LOVE IT!",5
180769,"I purchased this in extra large , b/c I read the reviews on the sizes. I typically wear a Medium in Adult sizes (think Express or New York & Co.) and Large in Jrs (think Charlotte Russe and Forever 21.). Unless the item I received was mislabeled, the sizing on this brand is absurd. The extra large jacket was so tight across my back I couldn't put my arms down properly and forget even getting the zipper tracks anywhere near each other.",1
331306,These are so small and dissapointing. The picture of the earring on the girls ear are very decieving. They do not lay on the ear like it shows and are about half the size. I went back and checked the listing to see if I missed something and closer look it appears the photo on the ear has been photoshopped. I admit they are of good quality so I might keep them for my 6 year old but they might even be too small for her ear. I really wanted these too. So sad.,2
587174,"Great skirt.  Now I have 5 different colors.  Fit is perfect and I am 5'3"" and the skirt just skims the top of the knee.  Very comfortable and elegant looking.  Bought several colors  because you can dress these up of go casual. I usually wear a size 8 and the  medium worked fine. Wish there was a camel color.  Perfect!",5
288149,"the product sent was not as expected. The product they sent maybe be similar from the picture provided, but do NOT be fooled! I was expecting an elegant branch piece along with a mystic dew drop, the same as the picture, but to my surprise was given what looks to me a twig with four leaves; the gem itself is also not like the picture shown. The gem shape and the silver like piece attached made it look like more of an eggplant. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone. Very disappointed.",1
310674,I love this waist trainer. First off i have never seen one is such a cute design. Secondly i like how this looks so much like a corset not just a body wrap. I like that it fits so well and doesnt make me look like an overflowing muffin. This is so pretty and the material is soft as well. Honestly i like how comfortable this is to wear. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.,4
802753,Nice concept but this shirt runs about two sizes smaller than what you'd think.  It almost ends up being a midriff top if you are larger in the chest area like I am.  The material is super soft and the idea is cute so I'll make it work,4
590645,Gorgeous clutch! It's VERY nice in person and it is surprisingly well made for the price I paid. It was a little smaller than expected but it held my cards and my iphone 6 (not the plus). Unfortunately it would not hold those things in addition to items like my keys or lipstick. It's not important but I was also surprised at the quality of the packaging that it came in as well.,5

If you are wondering if you can wear one of these bad boys, good news! I am 375 lbs and 2xl fits!  full range of movement, zipped all the way up (you may need help with that) and not all that hot actually.  I do get the feeling that I am the maximum this thing can take before some things start to give, but I took the risk and got the great reward :)",5

The upper edge leaves too much of my forehead exposed and I don't think it will do the trick after all.  It appeared to be well-constructed and of a good quality fleece.",3
113550,These wings are suitable for adults and very nice for the price. If you want to dress them up a bit you could glue some colored glass stones on them or  some other craft product or even just glitter fabric paint would do. They are pretty just the way they are.,5
317982,"I love these--they are beautiful, flow nicely, good material....BUT they are too big.  I am 5'9"", 145lbs, lean (size 4 pant) and the mediums are too loose in the waist, and too long.  I'm exchanging for a small, though, because I like them so much.  Still might have to get them hemmed but, wow, they are cute and have that ""effortlessly stylish"" look.",5
464849,My son loves his new boots! He has a wider foot so I was worried they may be too tight but they fit perfectly. I ordered his normal shoe size. He wore them to school then wore them trick or treating! He says they are comfortable and he loves the 2 tone color!,5

I'm a Large C small D cup size 3 Jr pants and roughly 145lbs and 5""2 the length on the arms are a bit long but it looks cute this way. Fits a little loose on the breasts but still looks cute with a tank top under. I could wear it as a dress honestly but looks good with leggings. I like the lose look anyways. It's a good shirt regardless , will be ordering more often from this company.",5
69176,"I bought this for my 2 year old nephew the hat was a bit big on his head (though he has a fairly large melon) but it fit well enough. He loved the pirate theme and wore it all day at the beach. It did a great job keeping the sun off his face and out of his eyes. By the end of the day I couldn't get him to take it off.

The quality is high and it's reversible which is always fun. It is brightly colored just as pictured and the patches are well stitched and securly anchored.",5

I ordered this so that I could wear alongside my son for the captain America Civil War movie ( I love a good theme). My son is a huge Spiderman fan and we knew that Spiderman was making a debut in the captain America/Marvel movies. We got so many compliments (he was dressed as Spiderman of course) and everyone loved my dress  even when I went to Walmart afterwords to pick up a few things, and the kids were not in sight.",5
754943,It's not a sweater. It doesn't move. I fit between 10-12 usually. I ordered extra large because it said it ran small. It really runs small. Even that is too snug to be comfortable. I'm grateful I only spent $13. It's now a Goodwill donation. It's not good for anything else. Save your money.,1
706576,"This is sturdy  material and the waist part is stretchy. And its super cute!!they are now an everyday  item for me when I go out. I have received so many  compliments on them. Make sure to wash delicately and to be careful putting them on and removing them. They are pretty durable but they are not a lifetime item. I replace mine about every 4 months or so with regular use. I imagine these would fit most body types, they are very stretchy.",5

So great to be able to find organic cotton, so much healthier!  Thanks Maggie for keeping the prices affordable.",5

522015,"I LOVE this bag! It looks so chic and fashionable and suits my body! It is a big bag, but I love big bags!! It has 2 different length straps so you can choose whether you'd like your bag directly under your arm, like by the arm pit, or hanging from your shoulder. I took off a star because the zippers are a little tricky to open. But the bag is sooo cute!! My fave go-to bag now... Thanks Steve Madden!!!",4

I had to wait almost a month for this dress,shipping is REALLY slow.  I will return it and hopefully not wait another month to be reimbursed.",1

With me having ginormous breasts (lol), it took a while to zip the side up. But never the less, people were complementing me left to right on the dress.",4
624582,"For a medium it is more wide than it is long. The graphic itself was really disappointing. It is very difficult to tell that it is toothless. I bought it for my friend who insisted I not return it, and that she would use it as a sleep shirt. For the cost of this I expected it to have decent details. At least the shirt is soft!",2
437280,"This is a great product! I get tons of compliments, it looks exactly as described although I did notice some initial tarnishing. I also anticipate that with a lot of usage, sweat, and (if you're like me) natural oils from the air, it will only tarnish more. So I'll put clear nail polish over it and try to wear them sparingly. But overall it's moderately uncomfortable but not terrible for a cuff and firmly stays in place.",5
18619,"This hat was so highly rated I thought it must be at least a little functional, and I wasn't planning to have her wear it in the water so I figured it wouldn't be too floppy. Unfortunately this is not a hat, it's a blindfold that covers her eyes all the time. Doesn't matter if it's wet or not. Most of the time she's wearing the hat, she can't see a thing and I spend all my time getting it out of her eyes. I even tried to starch it. Will be buying another hat.",1
781250,"I love this vest! I used the size chart as directed and when the vest came it fit perfect but within a week I was noticing some bulging where it was getting loose. The vest really does its job and I will be ordering a smaller one. I would absolutely recommend this vest to anyone wanting to detox or lose weight via ""sweating it out""! It is well worth the money and actually priced very reasonable. Love It!",5

She had to order a new and different brand cause one of the ""bones"" came out and just folds over now and their wasn't enough of them to began with. But you do get what you pay for and It wasn't a bad deal.",3
499391,I would give this 0 stars if it was an option. The shirt I received is not as pictured so buyer beware. It looks like a cheap knockoff with a really cheap print job that's faded. There is no shoulder patch on the shirt I received and it's really polyester and not cotton as stated. I feel ripped off and customer service refuses to help me now I'm stuck paying for something I thought was something else and it's not right.,1
319393,Love the material and color. The inside is sort is like fleece but softer so that's a plus when you live in a snow town but still want to look cute going out. I may order another just to workout in as I prefer bodysuits .... Overall satisfied. The only negative was that is wasn't as advertised with a snap button on the bottom for easy removal. You have to take your arms out of garment and pull it down if you have to use he bathroom. A little annoying since I was expecting a snap.... Oh well,5

After reading so many poor reviews, perhaps the current stock is not of the same quality as when I purchased mine. If that is the case, even tho the price is inexpensive, what they are sending out Now, would be disappointing at best.",5
181810,Fits like a charm! I got this for my Stuhrling Original Watch after it's original 2 bands had broke beyond repair. All I knew I needed was some pins for the watch and band and I was in business! It has yet to show any signs of breaking or any defects whatsoever! I love it!,5
719089,Love these shoes! Good fit. I have narrow feet but even so these were a little tight at first but ok now. Guess they stretched a little. I need them for walking my dog along the trails in the rain or dew covered grass and they keep my feet dry. Love them!,5
463014,"I read the description and knew that it was very small, just felt it wasn't worth ten for the size . Wish I had time to shop around, but I didnt, so Prime was to the rescue. Super cute and good quality with a hinge that keeps the box closed.",4
295762,I followed the rest of the reviews and ordered a size up from what I normally would wear and it fits perfect.

I have gotten many compliments on this shirt and absolutely love it!,5
420055,"O.K. - but thought there would be a more natural simulation of pearl finish.  These look too uniform and are obviously a replica.  What do I expect however, they ARE a replica!  They're O.K. especially for the money.  If you order, don't expect any ""peacock"" pearl depth to the finish.  I've seen better fakers.",3
730013,"I am a 5'2"", 124 lbs, bodybuilder.  I bought the size S grey and the dress length extends just past my knees. The dress is a little too big in the waist area but fits perfectly everywhere else.  It looks very elegant, sophisticated and clings to my curves nicely.  I'm in love with this dress.  It's my new favorite!  I wore it out on NYE and received so many compliments.  It was an absolute hit!",5
605926,"I really was not expecting much but I was surprised  to find a lovely scarf. It has some substance and weight-- not see through, looks good with everything from jeans to a black dress. The embroidery has a slight golden tone- very nice.  Tassels on the end are a nice touch. Every time I wear it I get compliments",5
480464,"I absolutely love this. Fits me comfortably at 9 months pregnant. I definitely wear this as a dress in public, not just as a nightgown. I do find that the bottom is more fitting that the pictures show, but I actually prefer that. Its so comfortable and the length is very nice. Im 59 and normally wear a M/L for dresses. I ordered a M and it fits perfectly.",5
130921,"I love this print and the price can' t be beat.  The problem is that I thought I should order a size or two up, and I really wish I didn't.  I usually wear a xs or s, I ordered a medium.  I am 5'5"" at 107 lbs.  If the had a small i would buy another.",2
516311,"I've been using this wallet for months.  I think it's a great minimalist wallet.  I definitely like that this one has the ID card holder on the front.  It's perfect for my drivers license and government ID.  I keep 3 IDs in the ID holder, about about 5 credit cards in the other compartments.  It's slightly hard to get the cards out, but it holds a lot and stays thin and light.  It's a great wallet for minimalist!",5
57960,The christening romper exceeded my expectations and looked so cute on my son.  At first my husband asked me if this was a boy's outfit but once we put it on our son he looked so adorable in it there was no question.  It is very nicely made and we love the snaps at the bottom for easy diaper changing access.,5
388382,"I am absolutely IN LOVE with this dress! I was a little worried about sizing because I read some reviews that gave conflicting information. I am 5'4 and about 120lbs, I ordered XS.

I love it so much I ordered another in red that is arriving on Friday",5
489086,"I ordered my usual size 12DD and a 14DD because of the reviews that said the suit runs small. I agree. The 12 was too tight. The 14 fit well, I liked the way it looked, but it gave no support. My chest bounced quite a bit with each step while walking. No beach volleyball in this suit! I returned both.",2

I'm a size S/M or size 4 (5'4"", 122 lbs) and they fit really well. I was impressed! The colors are all very true to the photo (except I think the red came a little more vibrant), and for the assortment you can't beat the price!",4

Fast shipping and will definitely recommend it! Thank you :)",5
117256,"These are fun :)  I wear the middle size and the smallest size together, and I think they look cute.  Not necessarily real, but cute.  Great for everyday wear.

686927,"Item was as expected and arrived in a timely manner. My daughter had put on some baby weight and what I hadn't anticipated was  -when item fits tighter it resembled a STAR TREK uniform.

My only concern is that it runs large I read the reviews ahead of time before ordering and got a size 8 my daughter is 11 and it still was very big on her,  especially in the arms and chest area.

This visor met my expectations.  It is so light and comfortable that I forget I'm wearing it.  Its adjustable headband works fine and has some elasticity, and the overall quality is high.

A great buy.",5
476949,based on the comments I was expecting it to be small for me but it is actually a little bit big. I am 5ft size xs (sometimes an xxs) and this top is very roomy. It looks just like the picture on me (except I have wider hips). It hits mid thigh in the front and back and the sides come up a bit- right at my saddlebags lol . I would buy it again.,5
233654,"I bought these on a whim about 6 months ago, and have to admit they really are handy! The guarantee is awesome. The case got some broken corners from going in and out of my pocket and I filled out the form online and a new case is on its way, free and no shipping charge.",5
874639,The first time I ordered I got the wrong item but they were very quick to send a replacement and told me to keep the first bras that were sent to me. Upon receiving the correct item it was perfect! Fit perfectly and very comfortable! Easy to use for nursing and easy to close clip when finished!,5
47691,I'm so happy I ordered these. They take a little getting used to but after awhile you forget they are on your ears. These are so wonderful. I wear them in the morning when I ride my bike or when I'm walking around campus. You will not be disappointed you bought these.,5
373519,"Ordered a size larger and food great at the top but stood my stomach the top goes from loose fitting style, to really tight. I have a larger chest and would expect it to not fit up top, but it doesn't fit around my stomach. Its like a large top post of the shirt, but small bottom part.",2
117449,"My boyfriend loves his kilt and gets all kinds of comments.  With no beer-gut and pants size 32, the 36 kilt is just right on him.  No belt needed (so the snaps show.). Had to repair the pocket stitching after only a few wearings, but the rest is very strong.",4
184091,"so disappointed! beautiful blouse and exactly what I was looking for but I couldn't even get it over my head! I usually wear a a small since I am 5'6"" and 125lbs but based on the reviews I ordered a large. It is really tiny. My daughter who is 5'4"" and 111lbs couldn't even get into it.",1
871907,"So pleased with this purse! I'm usually so picky with purses but when I saw this I had to try it. Honestly I was alittle scared about buying because of the other reviews but when I saw the purse in person my doubts melted away! It feels sturdy and it's so beautiful, the pattern is luscious and gothy and the inside material is so silky feeling, so happy with my new bag ",5
753649,"Super cute, I am hard on jewelry though. I've tried to be better about it. But, apparently not successfully. The jump rings gave out within the first month and I lost both Han and Leia. Till now, bangles had worked better for me, but I am not kidding that I am awful with jewelry. So bear that in mind.",3
254447,"This is a great bathing suit! The bottom is lined, and the top fits great! I bought a large size, and it fits perfect on the bottom. I'm a size 5, and a DDD on top. The top is a bit snug, but I didn't have anything popping out. I'm going to buy another in the purple.",5
852184,"After my husband passed away last year, I ordered these bracelets for the female's in my family and close friends. I continue to give to those that are struggling, after the loss of someone special in their life  or going through a difficult time.  It's a daily reminder to have courage and stay strong...  I feel blessed to have come across this bracelet, it is heartfelt!",5
644658,This is very light weight and pretty. The design was exactly what the picture showed. But the strings are too long and some of them are tied together like they weren't long enough  The arms are the right lengths and it goes to about right under my knee overall it's very pretty,4
774312,"My baby wore this for the first time yesterday and he looked so adorable in it.

What I like about it is that is nice and cozy, very warm but not bulky. The inside is very soft to the touch so it does not scratch.

It buttons up from the top to the legs which made it super easy to change his diaper without undressing him like others we have.

Shipping was prompt and the packaging done well. My goods arrived safely in South Africa.",5

He surprised his friends who were envious that he had acquired something so creative -- and here's a bonus:  it's warm in these cold winter evenings.  It will also come in handy at Halloween!",5
836897,"These panniers are flimsy and could barely support a lightweight satin! Not only are they expensive but they did not come quickly by any means! Do not buy these panniers, they are not worth it! If you are looking for panniers, make your own or find another seller, honestly, anything but these panniers would work well. The only good thing was that they could compress into a small shape which is helpful for storage.",1
351288,"This watch band looks good and is comfortable.  It comes with new spring bars and a handy tool to remove/replace them.  To adjust the fit, you have to lift a latch on the clasp and slide it.  The tool could probably be used to do this, but the latch is pretty stiff, and may bend the tool.  I used a small cheap screwdriver instead.  Once adjusted, the clasp clicks into place securely, and releases easily.",5
24304,"I have been looking for a nice field jacket to replace my old Vietnam era jacket. My son took the original and is still wearing it. Of course, it wouldn't fit me anymore. I was 30 lbs lighter back then.

This jacket arrived today and  am impressed with the quality. No complaints here. This should last a long time. I am 6', 200 lbs, and a medium fits me just right.",5
687885,Very awkward fit - the knot in the front doesn't really seem to function properly.  I've only worn the top once and it was with a highwaisted skirt where the top was tucked in.  I think I'll only wear it with highwaisted bottoms when I can tuck the shirt in because the bottom is so baggy that it looks sloppy.,2
88521,"Came in a small little gold box with cotton to protect it. It seems very fragile so be careful with it, hasn't broke on me yet. Looks great on your wrist!

October 3rd 2013 ALMOST A YEAR LATER( bought on october 8 2012)-
Doesn't have that nasty smell that most do after awhile. Hasn't broken yet either, that's good. Its really beautiful still shining! I recommend this bracelet!",5
424613,"I was very surprised how nice the ear cuff was when I got it! Solid and appears to survive the daily use and abuse.  It needed adjusting to make it fit, and after that it worked great! I would say it was a decent ear cuff for the price!",5
399538,"The case works fine, although it is a funky color.  It has a cool magnetic catch that works a little like a snap.  It is fine for ""on the go"" use.  One big drawback is that the dock connector cannot be connected to the unit when closed, but this is not fatal...",4
244387,I wanted a different type of ring to get married with. Something affordable and unique. I absolutely adore this ring! It is so gorgeous! I've had it for a few days now and I just noticed the skulls on either side of it. This is probably the best ring I could have picked!,5
648317,"Lighter material is see-through. Also, out if the plastic package this dress smelled like it had been sitting in a warehouse where people regularly smoke cigarettes inside. I had to wash it twice to get the dingy smoke smell out. I mean....its a maternity dress people! It shouldn't come smelling like smoke. I normally wear a medium and this seems to run small in the arms. The cut of this dress is nice though.",2
536609,"After reading the reviews I decided to take a half size bigger, as most of the (below 4 star) reviews said that the boots ran small. I'm not sure whether these people don't know their own size or they have large/wide feet because mine are too big. It's also longer/taller maybe because my calves are not big. I have to have them altered for the length. As for the size, I will wear them as is because they don't look big on my feet. Other than that, they're a cute pair of boots. I like them. Order your correct size!",4
160010,It's polyester material which isn't my favorite but it's not a really bad polyester. It's new polyester and not the stuff from the 70's. I'm pretty solidly an 8/10 so I ordered a Medium. It's fairly huge. I know it's supposed to be boxy and huge but I think if I had gotten a small it would be the same effect. It's cute with leggings. The material type would keep me from getting a second one.,4
504045,I buy most of my t - shirts from ROCKABILIA and have never ever been dissapointed.  I buy them also for my wife and daughter as presents.  I must have bought about 40 shirts from them now and they have never let me down... Thank You for the Excellant Customer service you provide :O),5

91138,"They did the job in the water, but were surprisingly uncomfortable to wear when moving around, both when dry and wet. The cut was strange around the leg. I wore them at a beach rather than a pool, so I can't speak to them being chlorine-resistant, but one plus to them is that they didn't retain sand.",3
820052,"Nice material but for the color (beige) it is very see-through and not forgiving. I'm plus sized, and my ars are always a concern. I like them to be covered. This top, though it fits very well, does not flatter the arms. It would if it was in a darker color. Love the pockets. But i wish the material was thicker for the ligher colors. Or double layered in the arms.",3
764815,The size fit great and it was very cute on but it was way too short for me.  I felt like just walking around in it people would just about be able to see too much!  And if I got a larger size it would just look too big on and I can't imagine it would be too much longer.,4
440793,"I bought this necklace for my wife two weeks ago.  We say a similar one at Jared's Jewerly and decided to look on Amazon.  Amazon was great!  The necklace turned out to be a cheap plastic knock off.

I gave Amazon 5 stars.....but the necklace gets 1 star.",3
729417,"This sexy lingerie is really beautiful. I usually wear 34D. It fit me perfectly The silky feeling you feel when you wear it, the way it flows beautifully as you walk. I really love it.  I bought the pink one. The lace on the top is very beautiful and it has a soft stretch to it. Everything seems well made and for the price it was a great choice.  All in all, I gave this product five stars just because it is so cute and comfortable.",5
363725,"It's was well made and super cute, I was disappointed because the top part was huge, the band in the middle was perfect, and the bottoms were small.. It's not proportioned at all. I am 5'4, 36D, and 155 pounds. I have an hour glass shape. Big top, smaller waist and bigger butt. I got a Large, in the red. I wouldnt say YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS.. But if you're top heavy and small below the boobs this would be super cute.",2
381746,"love the socks! They are thin, perfect for my baby to walk around and not slide everywhere. Only thing is, these are supposed to be for boys, and they had ruffles around the ankles. Luckily these are just used for around the house, so I don't care. Just weird seeing my Boy with what looks like girls socks.",4
123700,"the shoes are great for cycling HOWEVER, know that the cliips that it comes with is to be able to add the pedals to your own bike, it is not to take to the gym and use ont he cycle bikes at the gym. I do use them for the gym because thats what i bought them for but i had to go to a store to buy the cletes part that goes attached to the bottom of the shoe and i bought them for like 26.00",5
517708,Very happy with these!! Bought as a gift for my child who loves her new kicks!! Being a mother of 3 and having a family who love fly kicks I will definitely be purchasing more sneakers from you soon! The price was great and we got them a few shorts dats after ordering. Thank you,5
119312,"When I got the headband I was so excited, it took over a month to arrive. In the plastic wrapping it looked okay, and I was relieved since I had read many reviews saying they received the hair accessory with pearls missing. But, when I pulled it out of the plastic, one of the ear immediately fell off. I was able to fix it with some Krazy Glue, but I wouldn't recommend buying it.",2
271248,"Stretches out easily. They don't look as nice as in the picture and are closer to fishnet than lace. Pretty cheaply made. Seam runs down the center of the crotch and gives bad camel toe. However, for the price...these might be great for just a night out. Just don't expect to be able to wear them out, for a full day at work.",2
22121,Really great hat. Was concerned about size since my baby is 10 months and wears 24 months but there were no 24 month size. The 12-18 fits perfectly (a little big) but has a draw string that makes it fit more snug so it doesn't come off easily. It nice and lightweight seems comfortable and sun safe for baby.,5
476320,"The boots fit as expected and did not arrive in a box, which seems a bit odd, but they were in perfect condition.  They arrived a bit ahead of schedule, which was nice since they came ""across the pond"".  The recipient is only 5' tall so needed a shorter boot, and this worked out perfectly.  This was for an adult.",5
38586,"These pants were huge, including the legs all the way to the ankle and that was a long way.  While the fabric color was nice, (navy heather), they had to be returned.  And, by the way, the waist draw cord wasn't dyed to match the fabric but plain old white.  Waited almost 2 weeks for delivery and now they have to go right back.  Very disappointing!",1
304289,"When I received these in the mail I was so excited, taking them out of the package they are so soft and durable feeling.  I wear one of these everyday! They fit so comfortably you don't eed to rush home and take these off! I plan non buying several more.  No uncomfortable marks where the bra digs in, no need for constant adjustment, they just FIT and VERY WELL at that! ",5
86094,"I have gon through many boots in the last month trying to find a quality pair of boots that are acceptable for people with wide feet.  This is it.  I didn't need as much support as the insole that is provided has, so I pulled it and replaced with a simple 1/4"" piece of neoprene.",5
465462,"It works well as a carry on suitcase. I do not think it would stand up to heavy traveling as it is not terribly solidly made. It seems a bit on the inexpensive side. This should work fine for me as I am not a huge traveler. If I were I would have spent more money for something sturdier. The zipper on the inside of the suitcase lid does not function well and I expect it may break soon, hopefully not.",3
721716,"I love this cardigan & ive gotten so many compliments about it. I got a large & it fit perfectly. I made the mistake of putting it in the dryer though & one of the little handles broke off but that was my own fault. Moral of the story, don't put it in the dryer. Lol",5
205934,"I ordered a pair of the matte black wayfarer sunglasses and upon opening a piece that held the frame arm together popped off. I thought it was just a piece that hid the screw, but it ended up being the entire connector that popped off. So when I went to try them on the entire sunglass broke. Beware of this product is cheaply made and the local dollar store in your town probably has better sunglasses than this. My pair only lasted 10 seconds before they broke!",1
393763,"These socks were $14.97 during time of this review and shipped two day Amazon Prime.

The quality of the socks are very good and the compression was adequate.  I wear a men's size 15 shoe and purchased the L/XL.  These socks are not as tight as my other pair so if you wear around a size 11 you might want to go with the smaller size.  Socks completely covered my calve and elastic band at the top holds them up very well.  I use compression socks for hiking and skiing as a base layer.",5
241960,"Ordered this as a potential wedding band for my fiance. Shipped very quickly and was exactly as described. The ring looked great and was just what we wanted. We ended up returning it only because it it was a little wide on my fiance's hand so we're trying the 5mm next. If you want an inexpensive, tough, and great looking ring - this is the one for you.",5
258298,"I purchased two pairs of rainboots for my twins.
 My daughter loves these boots and they are very cute.  I ordered these in February 2017.  By late April, they had a hole where the toe bends.  I called oakiwear customer service and they immediately apologized and said they would replace them!  They asked if I would be willing to send some pictures so the product developers could see the problem and try to improve on future products.  Oakiwear was very helpful and easy to work with.  Thank you!",4
700376,"They are a little too deep (solved with an o-ring put on the back of them to take up the slack), and a bit sharp, so not the easiest to sleep on- but you can definitely get used to it.

Other than that- the finishes are stable and don't wear off with constant wear and they appear to be sized very accurately.",4
40225,"This T shirt was purchased for a gag Christmas gift, but when it arrived yesterday I was surprised and disappointed by the poor quality of the garment. The material is very lightweight, the overall dimensions for the size are small (even though I purchased a large for someone who wears a medium, I am almost afraid it may still be too small). It's probably too late to get another one elsewhere now. Oh well, Merry Christmas.",2
647580,"I'm large chested and bottomed so it's a little small, but it's cute for a bathing suit cover. Too short for wearing alone. Also, the back is open so you can't wear a bra with it. Started to fray after a single wash, but still, for the price it's cute for the beach.",3
768320,Shouldn't even give it a star. It came looking NOTHING like this. It looks like a lace table cloth. I wouldn't have minded the slight difference in material if it was actually cute but it's not. It's huge & is not v neck. Just a big see through poncho! Super disappointed.,1
170456,"It looks more like underwear than expected.  It's pretty - though bigger than I had hoped it would be.  I was hoping it would be something I could take the overshirt off of and still be okay to walk around in...not the case.  Fully transparent.

The lace detail is really pretty though!",3
757474,"This jacket is a very bright pink (think pepto bismol pink). I didn't realize it had shoulder pads, which I do not like at all. Not only that, the shoulders are stitched where they stand out like small wings. The sizing is accurate however and the jacket fits well but the shoulders made me dislike it. Also the buttons are a cheap gold that cheapen the whole look. The jacket itself is not a great quality to being with. I would not recommend it,",2
312182,Favorite Nike shoe ever! The flex sole is excellent for someone like me who loves the free feeling of sandals or being barefoot. These move effortlessly with the bend of my foot. I've worn these for multiple activities and I've had no foot or ankle pain. The white/green/dark grey color goes with so many outfits and the mesh breathes perfectly on hot summer days. Highly recommend!,5
613982,"I bought this to show off a tattoo I have. It is a little daringly low for me, but I figure I can add a panel or wear something colorful underneath. Or just be free with my open back if I'm in a daring mood. It fits just fine. I'm a medium 5 foot 3 for reference.",4
746034,Holy crap is this thing small. Incredibly cute and nice material but TINY. I ordered a 2xl because I know this brand runs small. Keep in mind I wear a medium for most things and sometimes a large if its more form fitting. I can't even get this thing on.  To bad because it's super super cute. I received this item at a reduced price in exchange for my honest unbiased review.,1
576423,"Received a pair of fugly boots that had absolutely nothing in common with what I ordered/what was pictured. At first it was funny, then it kicked in and I was very disappointed. It would be okay if the boots I received where cute, but they are so hideous I don't even want them in my house.",1
252795,"Very satisfied, gave this to my lady as a promise ring for now (until i can afford something nicer) but honestly she fell in love with it she has blue eyes (one of my favorite features on her) i told her the topaz stone represents the eyes i fell in love with... I highly recommend",5
883153,"This is a really pretty! It is slightly baggy and the medium fits more like a large, but it is elegant and a great length. It does have a low v neck so I will have to safety pin it but overall I love it and I can't wait to wear it.",4
16999,"I love these flip flops I will never buy anything else these are the best, the only problem I ran into was I first got the straps were a little stiff which made my not fit; however they expanded while wearing which I already knew would happen. If you have wide feet and are a size 10 womens these are perfect , the one specifically for women are to narrow for me.",5
795407,"I use this bag everyday as my work bag to and from teaching. It holds all the books and papers I need, plus the inside pockets are great for pencils and markers. I do not use the outside pockets. I love the option to use the shoulder straps or longer cross body strap. I also really like the hot pink interior as it makes finding things much easier than a darker interior. When I travel the rear double zipper works great to hold this bag over the handle of a carry on suitcase.",5
779182,Bought this as gift for my child's friend. It was a nice little necklace but the lightening bolt makes it top heavy and flips down all the time. It stays in places as long as it's against your skin but as soon as you bend forward and it hangs loose it flips.,3

It's more of a dusty blue, soft and muted. The ombre effect is pretty, but it'd be prettier if it were as colorful as depicted.",3
150496,Let me start by saying that this is gorgeous.  It is exactly as pictured.  The look and feel of the leather is very nice and the interior quality is great = very well done.  If there was any drawback for me it would be that there is no interior zip pocket for change.  But I knew that going in.,5
220301,These are a really nice pant. They are very warm and comfortable. I bought the L as shown in the sizing chart and they were a very snug fit. I returned them and got an XL.

It's really nice to be able to wear items of different parts of a game to express your love for it, I recommend this to any fan that wants an inexpensive variety.",5
7086,"Amazing fit and look. Very comfortable.  Only drawback is they are easily wrinkled. Solution is to add extra water to them after wash,  smooth out wrinkles,  fold,  then throw them in the dryer facing their tumbling direction. It's an annoying process,  but they are easily my favorite pants.",4

Wallet will not close if you put 20 credit cards in the 20 slots. Business cards maybe. If all you wanna do is keep actual credit cards, you can fit up to 15 if you want the wallet to close. Incredibly misleading description, that's for sure. Oh by the way, the leather actually feels nice.",2

And I'm fairly average at 5'7"" 140lbs.. Most of my height is in my legs, not my torso. So yea I was a bit disappointed especially since the picture shows it as a much longer shirt. Overall it's soft and comfortable but I wouldn't buy another one like it..",3

294287,"This product does have a strong chemical smell but not more so than other nylon stockings.  And that is basically what these are, heavy stockings.  This is to be worn under a skirt or a long tunic, which is exactly what I needed.  Good product.  I just wish the White was available in Large. Hint Hint.",4
313491,"MUST READ!!! THESE ARE REALLY GREAT

PROS: 1.) THE Pouch is absolutely perfect and very very snug ( holds everything perfectly) 2.) The materials is GREAT (5 Stars)

Cons: They are Cheeky, The runs across the Ass cheek and fills somewhat uncomfortalbe, However, ""possibly"" a larger size might have fixed that.

I will Update when I get the next larger size, which I ""think"" is not going to work out. but I will update.",5
130727,this product is great and I do love it but I am not a skinny girl so it fits a bit tight which is kind of a let down because it does say one size. I shipped fast and the detail in the skull was great so im giving it 5 stars.,5
758859,"I ordered these with the intention of it sucking in my waist and hip area. It's more like everyday underwear and offers very little control. It does smooth some awkward lines around that area but very slightly.  I'm 5'2, 115 lbs. and my pant size can range anywhere from a 1-3.  I have a little muffin top from having a baby and while I'm working on getting rid that I needed something to help. I'm looking for a bit more control, not an every day underwear.",1
500137,"This shirt is wonderful. Third Bamboo Dreams shirt I purchased and plans to buy more. The material is very soft and washes well in cold water, I cool tumble dry and have laid flat at times to air dry. Some wrinkling noted when I left in the dryer, but this seems to disappear a short time after putting on the shirt. Bought for traveling and found the wrinkle release was great after folded in luggage for 18 hours en route!
Very well made, and color stays bright after washing.",5
707234,"Maybe it's my baby's unusually large feet and thin ankles, but these fall off constantly - with no help from her at all! They are also tough to get on because of where the velcro is placed; almost like they were constructed backwards.  The footbeds don't seem to fit well inside the boot after washing, either.  I suppose for the price these are what you'd expect but I was hoping to get lucky.",2
165512,"These pants a awesome! They feel great on and are pretty close to sizes of any normal yoga pants. These are great because you can't see through them like many of the other yoga pants out there. Also, I find that they make your tummy look flatter and your butt looks nice too :).",5
756373,I ordered a 8/10 but what I received was what fit like a 4/6 I couldn't get into it. I ended up giving it to my daughter who is 14. Looks great on her. There was a whole in the shoulder so we will stitch and keep. I don't think the XL would fit either. If you are very petite this might work for you.,2
305863,"This product was not too small on me, but on any normal sized WOMAN! I have a 6 year old that wears 5T clothing who this fits perfect on!!! just so that you can imagine. Gladly, i had purchased another from another seller because otherwise it would have been a train wreck. The apron on the picture must be another because this was not it.  I will be posting a pic later. Defenitely a disapointment.",1
415509,Didn't know it was an XL for woman or kid. I was gonna wear it for a concert but when i got it it was way small and it was too late to send it back. I had to talk to my wife into wearing instead of me. Luckily it did fit her and she is a slim woman so i believe the shirt was for kids.,2
312994,"I suspect this dress was made in China...it is substandard, poor craftsmanship, thin, cheap material.  Very sheer, even with the half slip lining.  Would not be caught dead wearing this in pubic.  Could be used for a night gown?  Just a waste of money....and runs small.",2
152770,"First it came on time it also fit wonderful, I am a little on the thick side, but only in the right places, and it wasn't revealing of anything and it fits perfectly in the right areas. I would recommend this to anyone. Great buy it was so great that I purchased the White and the black one as well.",5
87890,"Prompt service, great seller... was worried about purchasing something like this site unseen - it arrived more beautiful than the pic can reflect! It was able to be sized smaller than 9 - having our own appraisal done indicated the suggested retail price listed is slightly overstated, but the appraisal was more than double the sales price! Home run on this one - he adores it! Was for our 10-yr.",5
625968,It's  a nice top but is not that I expected. The  accessories are nice. The material is different to chiffon as it was described.  The flounce design is not same as the picture posted (is more large). The top requires press or dry clean and it was not described in the description posted. The courtesy and service is excellent. My recommendation: update the top description and picture posted.,2
730143,"Though this is a very cute item, it is very small. I am 5'4, wear a size 10/12, and have a 36C bust, I ordered a large, this item is more of a small in US sizes. It is not sweater weight material, it is very thin cotton t-shirt material. This wrap also had several threads hanging loose when I unpackaged it. I'll have to see if it fits my 11 year old niece, because it actually sized to fit a child.",2
375237,The dress I received was not a kaftan style dress it was more like a 19 90s Jersey dress. There was an outpouching on the right hip that didn't go all the way in like a pocket so it sticks out like I have some abnormality growing on my hip. The seller stated they were trying a new design but this should have been discussed before sending this to me because I ordered an off-the-shoulder kaftan style dress not a old school Jersey tube dress.,1
154165,"We bought this wallet for Father's day and to replace a worn out leather wallet that became 1.5"" thick due to all the cards.  Although he was skeptical at first, it does a great job of organizing and creating a slim wallet that does not bulge in a back pocket.",5
548820,I LOVE LOVE LOVE these leggings! Earlier in the year I had purchased the capri leggings and love them. They fit really nice and are very comfortable! one thing that I like is that the waist does go up a little higher then most..helps suck you in a little bit! :),5
138952,"I am more full figured than girl in the photo... however this fits me close to the photo just bigger body, bigger shirt. I ordered this and 3 other items on the 20th and today is July 2nd which wasn't even 2 weeks ago and I received my products... I am sooooo happy and I was shocked to open the mail box and see a package from hong Kong here so soon. I definitely am going to buy from this seller again. Very happy with product and how fast it got here.",5
676483,"I loved this dress. The only problem I had was the pleating on top. My boobs pushed the pleats out and they unfolded. I'm posting a picture to show. I bought a black petticoat and a 3 inch black belt to finish off the look. I also wore a black cardigan to cover my man shoulders, and I must say, I looked pretty good. I'll definitely wear again.",4
392734,I wore these under a sticky bra (to prevent it from ripping the skin on my nipples) and on their own. Did the job both times of concealing the nipple but I would not wear these alone under a thinner material. The way it contoured to the breast was not flawless. 34DD BTW.,3
762710,"Love it! Initially bought a size large per their measurements but had to get it replaced with a size small, because it was way to big. Small is perfect. Exchange went super smooth within a week, shipping costs were minor on my part. The writing is bigger than in the picture. This will be my favorite exercising shirt for a while.",5
728220,"I don't know who taught this company to size, but they obviously aren't very good at it. I wear a size 16 to 18 in pants. I got the 2x size of these jeggings which are supposed to fit size 18 to 22. These probably wouldn't have even fit me when I was a size 10/12!!! What this company equates to a size 18/22 is probably closer to what normal people call a size six! Maybe even smaller.",1
841187,"I ordered a small (I'm usually xs on Women's and small on Juniors). The top is big and loose around the shoulders. Odd because Asian sizes usually run small,expected it to fit just right. It is doable but just a tad bit scared it might fall off. The color blue and material is nice. Still thinking whether  to keep or gift it to a friend.",3
12155,"The insoles themselves are nice. They have good support and are a good quality... for someone with higher arches. However, they just don't work with my low arches and actually cause more pain in my feet than when I wear my tennis shoes alone. Sadly, I'll have to return them and keep searching.",3
439459,"this shirt is amazing, this is a must have for any obituary fan. i think that it is pretty cool that it does not display the name of the album on the shirt, so when people comment on the shirt when your wearing it there going to have to know obituary.",5
45511,"I was expecting the pendant to be a little bigger- it is about 1 in. round. But that's okay! This is a very nice solid pendant and the chain
is very pretty/solid and adjustable. There is nothing cheap about this item except the price! My daughter also loves this-we share. This would be a wonderful gift- the packing/wrapping it arrives in is so attractive and fancy. I am very glad I ordered this item & would highly recommend it!",5
521344,It looks really cute on her but once you get it it's so puffy you look like a blimp I've been washing it over and over and over trying to soften  it up terrible good luck I contacted the company they don't care so no more business with them for me,2
404160,"These are lightweight, perfect for baseball and my 13 year old looked so cool in them.....and he has some serious eye protection...PLUS these are shatterproof and block the UV light.  For the price, THESE ARE GREAT!!!!!!!! I bought two pairs in different styles...VERY pleased!
I have one very handsome, very cool 3rd baseman!",5
48515,"I ordered this belt to address a short term medical issue.  To my surprise there are no specific ""holes"".  You can just insert the pin whereever you need.  And, it is qute stretchy.  I sit behind a steering wheel 2 or 3 hours a day, and I don't need anything cutting into my bladder!  This is perfect!  And, it looks great!  It has become my go-to belt.",5
119964,"Loved this orca design and bright colors on this swim shorts with built in swim diaper, however, I had to return it since the fit was a whole size too small.  Could not find this design in a larger size so that was disappointing.  I recommend these, but order a whole size up.  The 3T fit like a 2T even when other 3Ts can be a little too big on him.",4
18053,"Anyone confused by the dimensions listed?  Here are the proper technical dimensions:  Eye size 50 mm, Bridge 13.0 mm, Temple length 120.00 mm - as supplied to me by the seller. Nice glasses, but not for me despite some reviewers saying they fit an adult narrow head. My reading glasses have a temple length of 135 mm and I'm a petite adult, so I am confident that these would not fit me in the arm length.",4
546653,"it goes awesome with my Rat Fink tattoo! I'm 5'8"" and an F cup and the XXL fit snug with plenty of wiggle room and length so I wasn't having to constantly check myself. Very comfy and sexy all in one! It's kind of a ""costumey"" material but I didn't find it too weak or itchy personally, and it came almost a week early!! I am very, very pleased and will be ordering more of this dress in different patterns!",5
147223,"""Always in my heart""! necklace is everything I'd hoped for!  It is of the highest quality and yet dainty, and a definite keepsake. I purchased for my mother-in-law to carry a few of my husband's ashes. She bought one for me as well. We wear them daily keeping him close to our hearts....",5
411049,"This bag was perfect for our preschooler for summer camp. Held change of clothes as well as the matching lunch box. We loved that it is made of a very durable and waterproof material. She'll be using it again this next summer. It is also small enough to sub as her ""diaper"" bag for her dolls.",5
553408,"I ordered a large and the size chart seems to reflect the product. These leggings fit snugly, but I still feel like I can move comfortably. The dark colors of the design keeps the leggings from being see-through, despite the fact that they are tight. The patterns are bright and the owls look awesome.",5
746653,"Purchased the BEKDO Womens Classic Military Anorak Jacket with Waist Drawstring:  Item runs small, so be sure to order a size larger than usual.  The jacket color/shape was exactly as expected.  The lining is nice and makes the jacket seem higher quality.  However, the pocket had a hole in it and a very small defect in the fabric.  For the price of the jacket, I simply sewed up the hole and kept it.  The defect worked with the military cut/style.  I would still recommend the jacket for the price.",4
494900,"I bought these for my son, who is 6'1"" and they were really short.  I lengthened them all the way and they still stretch quite a bit.  Also, the metal piece on the back is kindof flimsy and bends easily.  My son still loves them, but mostly because it's Doctor Who.",3
869157,"I ordered the red and the pink. They're heavy material and more of a dusty pink than pale pink, and bright crayon red than the blood red they look in the pics. Fabric has sort of a dotted texture to them? They're nice quality, though. Comfortable, and cute  I'm 5'4 and ordered a small, they come like 2-3 inches from my butt, but that's with wearing them kinda high (view pic) ",5
751500,"My wife loves it.

the only reason for the 4 stars is that there are two small leather dongles/additions on the ends. One side snapped off after two days of use. Not sure what they're there for but it doesn't impact functionality. Just seems a cheap mistake in quality. Other than that she's had it for over a month now and wants another one!",4
413548,"Very chunky and thick beret. Seems well made and is soft. Only reason I rated it as 4-star is because I bought the Dark Grey thinking it would be steel blue (the photo made it look steel blue), but it was actually a regular tone of gray not too light and not too dark.",4
239882,"I lost my 6mm Tungsten ring to the ocean while on vacation.  This one was from the same maker but it appears to be slightly thinner than other 6mm rings--maybe by 1 mm?  Strange.  Still looks good though.  Love the ""white"" tungsten.  Nice and bright and almost scratch proof!",4
197754,"Beautiful bikini however mine arrived with some deep creases on the bikini top which are very noticeable. Also, the fit wasn't quite perfect on me. I am usually an XS or S but this small was a tad bit too big. It would be a good fit on a 34 B in my opinion.",3
850870,"DO NOT WASTE OUR MONEY. This item is nothing like the picture. I am a 38C and 40in hips, ordered a small and the fitting was just off; the seams in the straps are full of tension, it is very uncomfortable to wear, there is a weird bulge/spacing in the back area. It doesn't even look flattering.",1
120324,"I have a skinny, potty trained 2 year old.  These work great to satisfy health code requirements in my state (all kids under 3 must wear swim diapers) while allowing him to feel like a big boy.  I bought size xs and he is 23 lbs and 35"" tall.  The waist is a little loose but in no danger of falling off.",5
318346,"After reading the description which the merchant tells you to purchase a size L, I decided to go with their advice and purchase a size L. For reference, I am 5'3 and I weigh 143. The size L fit perfectly. It isn't snug or tight. I love the length and the color accentuates my black bodycon dresses.",5
6300,All i wear are carhartt pants. I wish they made this canvas carpenter design in more than 3 colors because I have 2 pairs of each. These are the most comfortable pants that I have ever owned. They are breathable and not rough like the typical work pants. This is my favorite color as well.,5
75570,"I wasn't sure what size to order, so I ended up ordering a size1 in black based on the size chart. I'm 5'4"", 130lbs pre-pregnancy, and 19 weeks. Today was the first time I used this and so far, so good! It's snug enough that my pants aren't moving, but not tight.",5
483835,"I totally got suckered by what looked like a really cool print when I bought this. First off, the fabric is about as cheap as you can get - it's like parachute fabric. secondly, there is NO fit whatsoever to this dress - it's pretty much a sack with a strip of fabric attached to it to be used as a belt - and it looks like it. In reality the color is totally different, not modern at all. This is one of those things that looks cute online... until you get it. Be warned.",2
697666,This item looked nothing like the photos. I bought the item two sizes larger than I needed and it is still too small. The sleeve portion is very cheap looking and poorly constructed. The beading is very large. Due to time constraints I am not able to return it and will have to have major alterations to rework the dress.,1
11091,"When I got these I thought ""they are too thick, my feet will melt"" but I gave them a try and was pleasantly surprised to find that my feet stayed comfortable all day long. I also should have checked the difference between men's and women's sizes so mine are a bit on the large size though not enough to be an issue. So, I would recommend these to anyone who lives in a hot climate and needs to keep their feet comfortable while wearing sneakers or heavy shoes.",4
564977,I kind of expected the Medium bag to be a little bit bigger than it actually is.  I do love the look and quality of this bag.  I guess I'll have to do without some of the things I normally keep in my purse for just in cases.,4
322257,"I bought this for my 4 year old daughter for a trip to New York City and it was PERFECT! While in NYC, she never once complained about her ears or head being cold...even in 30 and 40 degree temperatures with cold wind chills. She loves it and says it keeps her nice and warm! Highly recommended!",5
453491,Came early! It arrived about a week and a half earlier than it stated it would arrive. Only bad thing about it is that it's on a cheap chain and there are scratches on the fake gem located on the side.. Wasn't really happy about that but can't beat the price!,4
407713,"This is a totally awesome minimalist pack.

It has all the key features: an easily adjustable chest strap; a lightweight waist belt; one external and few internal pockets; and an internal strap to support the bottom when you're carrying really dense loads.

As with anything, there a theoretical quibble: the gap between the dual pulls in the main waterproof zipper makes it non-submersible.

ps. the mustard color's light enough to be visible, but just dark enough to be socially presentable, and the reflective patches are big enough to be meaningful.",5
298543,"The product could be better if the very thin pocket designed to hold your cards could hold more.  Otherwise, I really like the external card holder, and the main pocket expands to be huge!  I just had to rearrange my wallet to put everything in the one big pocket.  Leather quality is good.  Thing breaks in nice and soft.",5
865341,Amazing customer service and delivery were prompt as expected! These sleeves were an absolute game-changer for me as I do CrossFit five to six days a week. I have a 0 knee pain and I can do squats and thrusters to the best of my ability now! I would highly recommend these to anyone :-) and the size chart is spot-on.,5
46368,"Got this skirt for a party...it is short! I wanted it that way, but it is really short so keep that in mind when ordering. I wear a 14-16 normally & ordered an xl. It's not tight & very comfortable. I got lots of compliments while wearing it & the price is great!!",4
62037,If you have had a c section you need to get this. It's the best to hold you in so you can heal properly. I developed an infection after my c section and then it opened after a month. Once I started to use these I am now on the road to healing and recovery! A must!,5
398157,"I bought the blue shaded version of the Eastbay polarized sunglasses and received a pair with horizontal distortion lines in the lenses. If you wear these often, I am sure it will kill your vision after a while. It is a pitty, because they fit snug, look nice and give good protection, but totally useless as focusing through those lenses is impossible. I have contacted Eastbay about it but they seem to busy to reply, after all, I only lost 7 us$, right?",1
816983,"I love this sports bra! I'm a 34 C and ordered a medium, and it fits perfectly! The support is excellent, and the fit is comfortable, so it's the best of both worlds. Also, it's super cute! I love the mesh accents! This also makes this bra super breathable so it cuts down on perspiration. I wish there were more colors to choose from because Id buy them all! Great bra, great price, great performance! A+ from me!

Discounted for evaluation",5

852846,"These pants are weird.  They've got a ruching on the outside ankle that just makes everything sit funny, and the green is way more of a vibrant lime green than the seafoam green I got from the pictures.  The fabric is also very thin, I wouldn't wear them in public unless i had a shirt long enough to cover the butt which defeats the purpose of the pretty bright waistband.",2
155434,"I'm totally pleased with my BRYK RFID wallet.  It holds everything I was carrying in my leather wallet, but seems smaller.  And it's much easier to use.  Finding what I want from it is very simple.  And I am able to keep a few folded bills in one of the compartments.  In a word: Perfect.",5

792574,Wow the color on this is gorgeous...  I wear an XL in most things and I probably could have gone with a large instead.  This is fairly large but super cute fit and color.  Seems like good quality.  I have washed on delicate and hung dry and seems like brand new.,5
463262,"Very nice purse, good quality, quick delivery, great price.  However, when I got the bubble gum color which was darker and brighte than was pictured.  I returned it for that reason.  All the selections were very bright colors, and if you are looking for a very colorful purse, it would be perfect.",4
346670,"I have only used the 22mm bars so far, and they fit my watch well. The packaging could be improved however. The container that holds the spring bars was initially taped shut in such a manner that made it difficult to open initially. Once open, the container needs to be taped shut again each time you use it because otherwise you risk the lid inadvertently coming off and spilling all of these spring bars. It would be near impossible to correctly sort all of spring bars into their appropriate size.",4
357466,"I get loads of compliments on this watch.  It is often mistaken for a much more expensive brand.  It looks great and functions well.  The clasp has held well for me, the band is comfortable.  I can't believe this price for this watch.  Definitely worth it!",5

However it is too small.
For an extra lager it seems to be cut very slim

So thank you in advance towards my next order.lol",4
819998,I am a nurse with a few jobs and I love this bag because it allows me to organize my tools as well as plop my purse inside and run out the door for work. I love that the top zippers so things don't fall out. The pockets are big enough to hold water bottles which is another plus! Not to mention its eye catching and adorable!,4
19852,My daughter is 2 months old so she is not able to wear sunscreen yet. We got this hat to cover her face when we are in the sun. I like the hat because it is adjustable to fit her head. She will be able to wear it for a while.,5

Tackle bag, Bates boots, my hat, camel back. Repels water perfectly.

I never did a test to see how long it holds up but someone else apparently did.

For as light of a coat you need to use, and the coat, it'll last a while.",5
7873,"The ring is really beautiful.  You can just mesmerize yourself twisting the ring around and seeing the different color gems around the ring.  But I have to caution.  The price is a steal, but beware of the $5 shipping rate.  Other than that I have no complaints.",4
604263,"Interesting.  S/M was too small for me and I'm a medium. But the real reason I'm sending them back is that the velcro attachment goes right over the ear. It's comfortable, but when i rip the velcro off, it's so loud that it actually hurts my ear.  So it's going back.",3
17693,"Lovely rings!  other reviews that stated that the rings were TOO SCRATCHY to wear seem to have exagerated the feel of the rings, they are not perfictly smooth, but they don't bother me at all.  they look like real diamonds.  i thing the size runs pretty true if slightly small.",5
393288,"i like this alot.  It's on the thicker side for a wallet, however, i really enjoy using this as a wristlet when i'm only running a quick errand.  It is very soft and fits a lot and then some.  My iphone 7 with pelican (similar to lifeproof) case fits perfectly in it.",4
36195,"These umbrellas worked PERFECT for my kids' Halloween costumes! I've seen other posts about them being ""dirty."" They are NOT dirty. They are, however, covered in a powder.

785056,"It looks just like the picture and was delivered early so big bonus. I thought I'd get an XL because its hard to tell what the size is really going to be like, it is too big should have gone with a large. The fabric is soft and its comfortable. The red is slightly brighter than expected as well. All in all i like it and can make it work.",4
518895,"This hat seems to be well made. The cotton is soft and thick,  and you can tell it's high quality. I bought this for a baby shower gift and think it's definitely gift quality.

One thing that I don't love is the color which looks beige on my screen was more of a light yellowish green beige in person.

Overall, I know this is a responsible company that makes high quality products and so I would purchase from them again.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for this honest review.",4
785089,"I love it! But after putting it on twice the elastic is already stretched out... I can still wear it, but it's just a little baggier on my wrist than it was the first time i put it on... I'm worried that over time the elastic will stretch too much and break or not hold, but in the meantime I'm gonna wear it all the time! It might end up being perfect. I've had other malas not made of elastic, the elastic on this one does make it easier to wrap and wear it as a bracelet. ",3
268724,Had to complete the neckline sewing as it was left unfinished. The skirt has a shorter undershirt/skirt beneath that just kind of got in the way of things until I pinned it. If you have boobs and don't want to worry about sewing the neckline given the front closure you may be hosed. But it is a good dress otherwise with the pretty embroidery as pictured and looks quite good if one wants to take the extra step to sew it in the right places.,3

An XL will not fit the sizes it says it will...unfortunately we had so much going on around the time of purchase, I kept forgeting to return it for a refund.  To add insult to injury the package it came in was damaged...looked like it had been opened and returned several times. I don't suggest buy from this company!",1
249891,I had an incredibly difficult time finding waterproof gloves for my toddlers.  That you make and sell them was awesome.  However the fit is so poor they won't stay on.  I think the sizing is a bit large. My 18m old is big for his age (90th percentile) but the 1 year old size gloves just would not stay on.  Your gloves fill a gaping hole in the kid's snow gear department but have room for improvement.,3
43078,"It was tough to find 3.25 strength reading glasses and, when I did, they were very expensive.  I couldn't believe this deal - 6 pairs of glasses at 3.25 strength for $11.99.  It was such a good deal, I decided to give it a try.  I was pleasantly surprised to receive my order two days later securely wrapped in great shape.  I got three pairs with black frames and three pairs with brown frames.  They are sturdy material and the lenses work great.  I highly recommend this.",5
490008,"I love this nursing tank! I'm a big girl, and it is one of two tanks that fit well, look good, and is functional of many that I bought. Well worth the cost. The straps are substantive, as compaired to the Motherhood tanks, so I'm not worried this is going to break.",5
700481,"Fantastic purse, roomy enough for all my stuff, and so cool-looking!  This is my second purse from Montana West and the quality is great and the price is fantastic.  I get compliments on them almost every time I go out.  I do wish this one came with a strap for cross-body wearing like my first one did, but even so I can tuck this one relatively comfortably under my arm.  Great purse and great value!  I will be buying from them again.  I am definitely a fan!",5
411564,"They are a nice size (not too small and not too big). Not quite the same as in the picture - the silver edge on top of the opal does not exist. The stone is faceted in silver though. Hand made, but well crafted. Both stones have the same quality and in the sun shimmer brilliantly just as expected. Great earring for everyday wear. Nicely packaged in little silver box with exta padding and in little plastic bag. Fast delivery too.  Cute, Inexpensive, Fast - Great Value",4
566228,"Ordered dress for my wife. The picture is like a glamour shot compared to the reality. The material is very thin and cheap feeling.  But, the main issue is the seams that hold it together seem a bit loose, and there are a lot of long threads sticking out that should have been trimmed.",2
176740,"I loved the natural stones and the difinition that goes with each stone . I received my bracelet just in time for my birthday ! It is beautiful I only take it off when I take shower, have got a lot of compliments on it . I love it !",5
100499,"The price substantially changed shortly after purchased.  I was ripped off.  They won't refund the difference and won't allow me to return it.  Horrible customer service.  The quality was also not of a good standard, especially not for what I paid for it.  I am very angry at the seller and at Amazon.  Their guarantee was worth nothing.",1
383610,I love the fabric and everything about these capris except one thing: one leg was sewn shorter than the other so it rides up to my knee when I'm walking so I have to constantly yank it down. Other than that they're great and the full length leggings are my favorites!!!,4
56004,"buyer beware...this did not come with the socks, as advertised.  the shirt is good quality and the shipping was fast, so I won't give it 1 star, but the shorts are garbage, and the lack of socks makes it an incomplete costume.  so now i'll be out more money to find a pair of socks to complete it and hopefully get it in time for halloween.",3
876489,"The picture doesn't do this dress justice.  I was very pleasantly surprised when I saw it for the first time. The jacket has some glitter that really dresses up the dress.  I liked the Petite size.  The dress will need no alterations at all.  It did arrive very wrinkled, but I don't expect it to be a problem to have them removed.",5
89513,"The fabric is stiff and I ordered a size larger than my normal size and I'm glad I did. So they run small, and the shape is a little boxy, but overall I love the color and I love the little loop inside my pocket it's perfect for a pen and it doesn't get lost",4
479309,I ordered this in a size large but found the large to be rather bulky on. It is very thick and you'll warm up pretty fast wearing it. I love the style but found the hip area droops odd where the buckles are. I may need to sew a support stitch to help it out. Otherwise it is a really lovely sweater and I think I may wash it to shrink it down a tad.,4
32569,"I'm normally a 6.5 shoe size, so I ordered a 7. My foot fit perfectly at the base, but then my calves (which at their widest are slightly smaller than 14""), didn't fit. The size 7 boots wouldn't zip up past them! They look great, but it's too bad they don't fit. I'm rating them 3 stars because this is the first time any boots have never fit over my calves.",3
814416,"I ordered navy in size small. My dress had a tag that said ""Topping.""  It fits a tad snug in the shoulders and has a little less swing to the skirt than I wanted, but it still loooks great and I enjoyed wearing it. The fabric is thin but not sheer and is mostly rayon, so the washing might be tricky. My experience with rayon is that it looks and feels beautiful, but is never quite the same after the first wash. For reference, I'm 5'4"" 115lbs.",4
328960,I am so mad! what a piece of crap! I don't know how they are even allowed to sell this junk. I ordered 2 not knowing how bad they would be.  the second one came with out a button hole also and yes the tassles do looked like a mop!  please when you order something make sure they aren't made in china..i am from now on...this isn't the first time..one time I ordered a sweater and it came in a baby size!  im so disgusted!,1
603502,"Its a real challenge finding anything but fabric mittens for toddlers, which all end up soaking wet and cause serious concern for parents when their kids are sad their hands are too cold. Luckily NIce Caps Kids Easy On Gloves are available at a really fair price... not to mention they are slightly adjustable, too, so their not a one season product.
Tested in the blizzard of 2018 in Pennsylvania, these gloves get two (warm) thumbs up by my family!",5
579212,"Guys this jacket is just amazing! And keeps you warm for sure. Quality isn't that bad but like it says (p-leather). Im 6ft tall slim fit body, and it fit me perfectly, not to small not to big. Arm lwnght right to the wrist and jacket just under waist belt. Its great i love it!! Definetly buying another pair in a different color!!",5
225753,"The shirt itself is very cute, it's basically a flowy crop top. However, the cut and style is just way too big for me and I'm a DD :( I'll have to adjust the straps and do some sewing to make wearable but even then it's me basically removing majority of the straps which help make the shirt extra cute. The shirt is cute but the sizing is all wrong.",3
58874,"I must say I was extremely disappointed when I opened the box. They are much smaller in length than they seem, yet the posts were way too thick. I tried several times to put them in, even had 2 others help me but BOTH ears started swelling up after third and final attempt for today. I'll be trying again during the next few days and I cant, then I'm sending them back.",2
503474,"It is different but not as expected. The neck is not smuggle tight like the picture shown here. Thin sweater which is great for my husband since he do not like really thick ones. However, you pay what you get and the neck is like a cowl neck instead of a turtleneck.",3
322912,"These are a perfect little tool for keeping your tie straight. They are expensive but they work for a long time, I haven't had to replace any yet. There is competition that offers something similar but the price is twice as much as these. I would buy these again. The price is right and so is the quantity you get.",5
157919,"This is nice looking PJ. I bought it for my 6 yr old son and got size 7. It fits him fine (after the first wash) and my son is a bit on the smaller side.
Pros: it looks great. My son absolutely loves it. He was very excited to wear it on Christmas eve.
Cons: colour fades after first wash. I am worried that the red will fade so much and it will become pink. So if you buy it for a boy, beware of that. And it shrinks after wash. But you can always get a size up.",4
832915,Nice quality. But the necklace part gets stuck on the hairs on your neck when u move it. Other than that the star part looks very pretty. The star kinda glows a bit. The words are also a bit blurry but gives it a nice effect. Im all Im quite impressed,5
358873,I have had this watch for maybe two weeks tops and the brown divers dial around the crystal fell off somewhere and now the edge of the crystal is exposed. I don't want to wear it in the shower because of this and now I am going to have to return it or send it for repair. Not happy!!!!,2
113686,"Not sure why people were complaining about the size. I got both a small and a medium because of the reviews and when I tried on the small it fit perfectly. I was worried about the chest area and again it fit perfectly. I am a 105lb, 5'1 petite woman with 34D chest. Get the small if you are around my size.",5
2798,"The ring was not exactly as I imagined it to be.  The picture made the stone look like it has a purple tint to it.  The stone is completely colorless.  The band is a little daintier than I thought it would be as well, but it doesn't matter if you have slender fingers.  The person I got this for loves it so I'm very happy with this ring.",5
58343,"These socks are ideal for lightweight travel. They take up minimal space, and dry in a few hours. But, one of the two pair developed a ""run"" the first time I wore them. The other pair has performed fine in 5+ uses. They look like dress socks and seem to stay up without much sliding down the ankles.

Pros: lightweight, space-efficient, very quick to dry, look fine with a suit or jeans.
Cons: durability questionable (one failed on first wearing), no cushioning, synthetic fibers",4
448355,this item took FOREVER to get. the product itself isn't bad. it fits my ear. does not fit my sons or boyfriends ear so i can only hope it fits the ear of the person i bought it for. my suggestion would be for amazon to publisize WHERE the product is coming from (not just the company). i hate ordering items directly from Hong Kong due to it takes way to long to recieve.,4
873073,"Although liked, it did have a seam flaw, i.e. NOT sewn in one location.  AND, when attempting to repair it found that the material had been cut too close to allow proper seam. Still gave it four stars since fit good and like material but that open seam was disturbing.",4
101312,"I bought these to replace an identical pair that was looking rough. Cute and comfy, but if you have thicker calves proceed with caution.  They are a very snug fit in that aspect.  I almost returned them but since I can comfortably work them up over my calves, I figured I'd give them a try and a chance to stretch a bit.  Just won't be wearing them with jeans.",4
427469,Very comfortable and very tough.  The ones sold by The Sportsmans guide are not part of the ones that were falling apart.  The only thing I can find wrong with mine are that the toe caps are slightly different but you won't notice unless you are looking for it.,5
217339,For years I've been looking for a hat to fit my head and look decent to wear to work as a physical education teacher and this is it! The hat fits perfectly and has a strap that keeps it on during those windy days. My face and head are no longer burned to a crisp and it's holding up well to daily use.,5
362427,"I like this eyeglass holder.  It is a little small, and my glasses are not very large.  So if you have a pair of frames with any heft, this holder will not work for you.  I would recommend one by Finte instead as the opening is more ample.",4
329192,"I put ""fits as expected"" because it's a one size so it'll fit everybody differently. However on me it's a bit small. I'm on the larger side of the ""one size"" I'm short but curvy, about 150-160 pounds, 36D. The dress was very short on me. I kept it because I can wear leggings with it. The quality is okay. It's not the best but not bad.",3
695988,"This dress is gergous however I wasn't avle to wear it and will be returning it. Im 5"" tall (like even 5 foot) and weight about 130lbs but I have a size 34DDD chest. I tried on the dress and I couldn't even.get it on my chect. The rest for fine accept it was very long. So I will be returning it.",3
126006,"The scarf is super thin and fragile (it's supposed to be chiffon after all). The length is also more like 160cm rather than 180. The stitching at the hemline is poorly done.  I'm not sure for how long I'll be able to wear this scarf before it gets torn down. I know it's super cheap but for this length and quality I'd pay $2.

Edited: I'm increasing my rating from 2 to 3 stars. The seller (Zeagoo) was super helpful and accommodating in refunding/returning the item.",3
840097,I read the reviews for this before I bought and thought I would try it anyways. The bathing suit is cute but it is not cheeky... it is a straight up thong. I am 5'3 140lbs and I got a large. It was still a complete thing and my boobs were constantly coming out the sides. It's like the top it made to big and the bottom is made to small. Regardless I decided I would wear it a could times. The second time I wore it 2 of the straps broke off from the seam.,1
686385,The backpack is very beautiful but the quality is HORRIBLE. All the flowers from the zippers broke within 6-8 weeks and now 8 weeks of use later the main zipper finally broke. The backpack is falling apart everywhere and school has only been in session for about 8 weeks. Very disappointed. I just had to buy another backpack only two months into the school year.,1
112631,"I wasn't expecting much for such a cheap ring, but I absolutely love this. My ring size (on my ring finger) is a 7. I also have pretty small hands. I like to wear this on my middle finger as I think it looks more balanced. On my ring finger I didn't have to adjust it out of the package at all, and on my middle I just loosened it up a little bit.
This is a great statement piece and I've gotten several compliments on it. Yes, it takes a while to arrive, but who cares? It's so cheap!",5
844595,"Solid piece of Scandinavian jewelry. I like the traditional design. Not too big, not too small. The channel at the top is a bit small. I wear mine on a leather thong and it is a tight fit. The back side design looks a bit smooshed. Overall, great homage to a Scandinavian heritage.",4
630238,I have become a huge Eileen Fisher fan and this is a must for the streamlined closet.  It fits true to size and the silk jersey is so yummy to wear.  I live on the West Coast so I can wear this almost all year round and found it to be a great weight for an air-conditioned office.,5
628076,"Like many, I have problem feet.  I seem to have Band-aids on more toes than not.  I wondered if toe socks would solve the blister problem.  I tried Injinji but their weave is a bit heavy even in the lightest weave.  The Fila have a thinner weave which seems to work better.  So far so good.",4
791826,"This costume is paper thin and completely see through from head to toe.  Normally, I do not complain about a thing but I was extremely disappointed with this costume.  It is very cheap and flimsy.  I ordered an adult large and it could fit someone who was XL and 6 feet tall with the bottom of the skirt still dragging the floor...",1
555259,"Looks great and if it fit would probably be a nice vest. Sizing is waaay smaller than you might expect. Because I had trouble with the Tempco coat that arrived at the same time, I won't reorder as I question the durability of these products. Plus, I doubt they even had a size for me.",3
309858,I love this ring. It looks perfect .the only thing I'm upset about is the fact that I can't figure out if its real silver or not. It looks like its not sterling silver ... Still very good quality and impressive looks just wish it was real sterling silver :(,4
507575,"It's super cute, love the colors and design and it fits comfortably and as expected. I get a lot of compliments on this skirt. I've washed it in the washing machine and it's held up okay (I hung dry)...not sure what the directions say to do, probably says hand wash.  The only flaw is that the material is somewhat cheaper but nothing too bad.",4
761117,"Worst bathing suit that I've ever ordered. The top piece isn't even sewn together correctly, I can't even begin to explain how messed up the top was and the bottom was way too small, if you need some motivation to workout by feeling horrible about yourself buy one of these.",1
765225,"This top is super cute.  It fits well and looks nice.  I like the tank underneath and that it is a darker color than the sweatshirt part.  My husband quite likes it when I wear this top.  I would highly recommend this top.  I would say it fits well, however if you want it baggy at all I would go a size up.  *I recieved this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.",5
682318,This is one of my favorite summer dresses! I thought I might have to order a size up but I'm glad I stuck with my regular size ( Medium ) when ordering. Looks great with the belt but if you can't stand the cinch it pairs nicely with a large hat &/or a long necklace & heels. Very comfy!,5
690646,"Absolutely Beautiful.  Same color and everything.  Great material for it being so inexpensive.  You better have a decent waistline for this because the band is tight!! I still have a few more inches to shred.  The rest fits very nicely.  Padding is fine for the boob area.  I am 5'3, 150lbs, 32G.  Would definitely purchase again!",5
22088,I bought this hat for my 5 month old grandson. He is smiling when I put it on. He has 10 other hats which I shouldn't even buy. This one is the best. Fits him perfectly. It can be adjusted to fit for many months to come. Very soft and good color to match most of his outfits.,5
556093,"Great Leather Coat. I didn't know what to expect size-wise, but this coat fits just the way I like it. It is roomy enough where I can wear a bulky sweater or sweatshirt under it or just a shirt. I love the styling and texture of this coat, and it has great pockets.",5
397934,"Best jeans I've ever owned.  So this is why I own about 6 pairs.  I love how much they stretch, that they are not too think and how they feel like sweatpants - yeap, that comfortable! The only negative about these jeans is that they stretch way to much after wearing 1x or 2x but after each wash they are back to normal.  Hope DKNY doesn't discontinue these.",5
1669,"I like the Henschel hats. This was actually the 4th hat like this that I have ordered. All of the other ones were size large & they fit nicely, so once again I ordered a large, but this time the large was way too small, so I returned it & ordered an X-large which I am waiting to be delivered now.",4
398124,"Nice hat, fit exactly as expected. This replaced a similar, older hat I had for many years, except the old one did not have a chin strap. As a result I ended up chasing it down streets, sidewalks, cruise ship decks, etc. more times that I can remember. This one looks great and so far has stayed right where it belongs.",5
317353,"Only reason this ""fit as expected"" is because I followed the recommendations of other reviewers.  My daughter normally wears a US size Small in this style but I ordered a Medium and it fits well.  It would be nice if the seat of the bathing suit had a larger coverage area but it is the style of the bikini, not the size that causes this issue.",4
274382,"Terrific belt!  Excellent quality, strong ratchet buckle mechanism, very easy to release, and looks great.  We'll worth the price.  You can adjust the length very easily by trimming it, and the fit is smooth and fashionable.

If they also sold this belt in a 1.5 inch width, I'd buy it in a nano-second.",5
17718,"I ordered this set of 3 cz stack rings to mix and match with other rings.  They are gorgeous, solid silver with very nice bright cz's, unlike some much more expensive ones I have ordered in the past from a very expensive on-line store which I promptly sent back.  These little rings are quite dazzling and look lovely worn together or used as guard rings each side of just about any ring you already own.  At just over $10 for each ring, they are a steal.",5
814009,"This is definitely a form fitting, short dress. I'm 5'7 and 150lbs and ordered a size L. It was tight and the V was very deep. Quality was ok, but I felt like the pattern was off centered which made the dress look a little odd, then when I looked at the back it's clear to see that the zipper is sewn off center.",3
150978,"I love it, a lil tight in arms but I have big arms so i figure it would be also shoes ALOT of ""boobage"" im wearing it out in vegas so all good but its a deep front cleavage cut. I sewed it up a bit just so a boob wouldnt pop out. lol. For the price this is a super cute dress! They only reason I gave it 4  stars instead of 5  is because the material looks a lil cheap but again for the price excatly what i expected.",4
728175,"I purchased this scarf for my stepson as a gift. Its diffic to know what a preteen boy would like. I wanted to get him something he would enjoy, as well as something I can afford. He loves designer clothes.
This was the perfect gift as it was affordable and pretty and it arrived quickly and packaged so delicately. I didn't order it to be gift wrapped, however the way it was delivered, it looked as though it was gift wrapped.
He loves it and wears it all the time. Its soft, pretty and keeps him warm. Truly the prefect gift.",5
763557,"I believe I ordered my dress somewhat larger ... but had it adjusted, which I think was best.  This dress is absolutely stunning, drop dead gorgeous, BEAUTIFUL. Which I could wear if over and over again. I was overwhelmed with the compliments on this dress. No no regrets here.",5
115693,"Reasonable price and they fit nicely: the socks don't squeeze our toes, like some of this kind do. What we see in the pictures is what we get at home. I am happy with the product and would recommend it for anyone who would like to wear them with Skeletoes, for instance (I bought them for that purpose).",5
110290,My daughter asked for belly button rings for her Christmas gift. I chose these because of the sparkly colors.  I either did not read it in the reviews or it was not mentioned but you can change the balls to have two different colors which my daughter things is amazing.,5

I AM built like a broad-shouldered linebacker so finding ANY women's cardigan or shawl that isn't tailored I have to go up a size or 2 just to make it work.

So, it looks nice, although it's not a rich black (more of an ash black), but I took 1 star of the color, and the other star because I went up 2 sizes and it's STILL too slim in the shoulders.

I'm keeping it simply for the UV protectionI have a severe form of PMLE.",3
311599,Bought them as school shoes for 6 yrs old who loves to run and climb. Compared to other school shoes these are great. Live in Cayman Islands. Been wearing them every day from school started in late August. They still fit but needs to be replaced because the toe area is worn out. Front needs to be reinforced otherwise a good buy.,3
408559,I bought this for a trip I am taking because I was looking for clothes that would travel well. The problem is it was much smaller than a shirt that size should be. Not even close. Also the buttons did not appear to be sewn on well. I had to return it.,2
118904,This came faster than expected. The sizing is way off. I am usually a size 8.5 but ordered a 10 to wear on middle finger or thumb. This ring runs very small. The 10 fits the ring finger that's a size 8.5. Disappointed wanted to switch fingers to wear. I want to return but I watched this ringfor a long time and really liked it. The sizing is wrong.,2
812005,Very pretty very sparkly I bought it for me and my 6 year old daughter that's autisticc and  misses me at school so when she comes home she puts our hearts together and It just gets her  through the day. but it's already changed color and one of the chains was broken when I got it so i just put it on a ribbon,3

I thought it would be of heavier material but it is obvious that they use a very thin yarn the hat is not line and for the price I am extreamly disappointed in this hat, should send it back not worth my time and efforts, will NOT ORDER AGAIN !",1
639040,This pattern on the is very cute. I suggest if you are going to order this get the largest size that is possible even if your normal size is an xs. It also is very thin. I did not return this because it is too much of a hassle. It is somewhat good just make sure to get the biggest size.,3
128760,"I live in Miami so this rain coat is perfect, it is extremely lightweight and doesn't make me hot wearing this coat when it rains. Its very cute and matches everything.

This served the purpose well, helped my eyes in high glaring sun  and looked stylish and fit perfectly on my round face. made a very rough use of it and it still is intact and will save it for future uses. comes with a nice  pouch for them. Good buy. I bought the black with gold lining.",4
665990,"I was little worried when I ordered this shoes thinking that what if they will be super uncomfortable and won't fit right. I don't really buy shoes online because I have to make sure they would be comfortable enough for me to wear them most of the day since I like to wear higher heel shoes out of the house. I wear them to the mall and forgot that I was wearing them, they are more comfortable than most of my flats.",5
640311,My normal size is Med. But on my previous purchase I bought a large and found it to fit me comfortable so I purchased a large again that was roomy and comfortable. I will purchase 1 more in red to finish out my wardrobe. They look good with pressed jeans and Henley shirt or dress slacks and nice pressed shirt.,5
665630,"I liked the material weight. But this ""oversized"" tee was not oversized at all! I am 5'6"" 120lb & this shirt barley covered my tummy. I was looking. For a t-shirt that would be long enought to wear with leggings & cover my bootie, this did not do that at all.",2
708395,"The picture matched up with ""eclectic blue"" does not match the actual pattern at all. I was expecting the black and white design in the image (I guess I thought the black might actually be blue, explaining the name. I would have been ok with it if it had been this design in blue). Instead, the umbrella I got is black with a dark blue paisley design. It's not my favorite, but not worth returning.",2
419972,I'm an avid runner and I originally bought these shoes for a specific race.  I ended up falling in love with these shoes.  I wore them to an 80's themed 5k.  They are light and comfortable like all New Balance running shoes.  I loved the red/orange color and most importantly I loved the price.  I wear these shoes all the time even when I'm not running.  People always ask where I got them from and how much they cost.  Amazing shoes with an even better price.,5
459227,"This top is so flattering. It fits very well throughout the bust and I don't feel like fat guy in a little coat when I'm doing CPR. The bottom of the top is loose fitting and perfectly hides the muffin top. Gosh, I love these scrubs so much! Well worth your money!",5
773232,"Unfortunately like other reviews my kitchen has some defects. Overall exactly what I want in a kitchen but the main piece that the sink sits in has a chunk missing out of it and the two pink knobs for the stove were broken.

287174,LOVE LOVE LOVE  this!  There is much more green than pictured and not nearly as much blue but it is still so pretty. It does feel a bit delicate but I paired it with an darker olive green cami and it was so beautiful! Favorite buy so far!,5
254240,Garbage. The side  blades do not  line up at right angles as they should. They are loose and rather flimsily attached. The handle is  enormous and far too large for a small child's hands. The belt clip is cheap and will break quickly. The blade retainer clip thing is very poorly executed and had already warped the tube of the blade during shipping. I am shocked that Disney allowed this crap to be marketed with the Star Wars logo on it. Not worth your time or money. I'll shop elsewhere.,1
835089,"I am 5'10, 158lbs. The large fit perfectly. This bathing suit seems to be of excellent quality and is soft and comfortable. I look forward to wearing it.

430991,"Pretty, but this bracelet is not for slim wrists. It cannot be pressed to make it smaller, so the weight of the pearls constantly pulls the pearls under my wrist. The pearls are never seen. This would probably work well on larger wrists. Bracelet is pretty, but I'm disappointed with this purchase.",2
774427,"When I opened the package and pulled out this shirt, my jaw dropped. I ordered an XL. The tag says XL, but it looks like it was made for a little girl it's so tiny. The material is not a thermal knit, it's a very cheap tshirt material. This was a huge disappointment and will be sent back.",1
112800,I called to order 1 zoomies for $10 and get the second pair free. The representative was trying to sell all kinds of offers. What arrived was 4 zoomies and a $36.90 credit card charge. Zoomies does bring the view closer but the image is not clear and therefore not useful.,1
287629,"I ended up returning because: larger than I expected, but more importantly, it is not the sheer that I wanted. A heavier material that looked like polyester versus what I was thinking would be a really sheer cover up sort of top.  I have to say, the refund was very quick once I dropped it off, and no cost to me to return, so the seller gets high marks for customer service!",3
705259,"These are great gloves: Fit is perfect, they keep me warm, soft both outside and inside to the hand. Nice grip for driving. They are supple - my fingers move easily - not like many gloves that seem to restrict my movement. I may buy another in another color, and would definitely get them as gifts.",5
582397,"I have tiny hands so these ended up being a little big, but it still looks very cuetsy.  (My hands are the size of some 7 yr olds I watch.  I wear a size 4 ring.)  Material is very plush and soft and actually keeps my paws warm.  I definitely look like a little Asian bear with these paws on.",4
356867,"I ordered this for my grandaughter who lives in a different state from me so had to wait till i visited her to give my feedback.
It is really cute.  durable fabric and i was impressed at the quality.  A bit large, but I didn't mind as she will be able to wear it for several years.
I just did one roll on the cuff.
Very pleased.",5
732566,"I am an average size and the sleeves fit like they are three quarter. Fits loose for an Asian person or petite frame.  Not worth $25 at all. Very disappointed. When you want to return it, they send you a label but going to cost more than half of what I paid. Lesson learned for me not to ever order an item from amazon that is out of the country.",2
116492,Ordered shirt a size larger for my niece (she is size S) still to small and no shape form at all. When I contacted seller to return I was told that I have to pay to ship back to china. I have ordered many things through amazon and always been happy with their return process...until now! Will not order any clothes unless it has PRIME,1
78071,"This is my second Zulu nylon watch strap. I bought a similar Zulu strap about 3 years ago and it still looks like new. I bought a new 24 hour watch and immediately replaced the leather strap with the Zulu strap. My wrists are quite small, so I trimmed about 1 1/4"" off the end and heated it with a match to keep the nylon threads from fraying. It looks nice, feels fine, and now I can wear this watch while playing squash without worrying about it coming off my wrist. One happy camper here.",5
870827,"The skirt is a nice quality and definitely hugs similar to pencil skirts.  If you would like less contour to the rear you will need a size larger. Stretch is nice and will fit around all shapes.  I just prefer for my line of work less rear contour, but saved the first one for date night and purchased  a size larger for work.",5
165738,"I was looking for some good workout capri pants since my other ones were falling off. I wear a size 6 in jeans and I took a chance ordering the small. I'm glad I did because even though they are snug, they are not too snug to breathe, walk or workout in. The fabric is very soft and comfortable. For reference: I'm 5'2'', 134 lbs.",5
755910,"this product is really poor quality and lousy finish, almost transparent fabric and bad .... it is a total and expensive theft buy another heater at lower prices and better quality thought to be a little more expensive was going to be better. .. a fraud and do not recommend anyone do not want people cheated out more",1
664710,"5 months later and my kid still wears them. I wanted Christmas pj's that were still tight at ankles like little kid pjs. After certain age 7/8 pants are loose at ankles. Last chance for little kid pjs on my big boy ( # mommy issues) . Soft material. Looked great in pics. **** Yes, I just used #, don't disregard my comment because of it.",5
111302,"This product was advertised as a 100% cotton Official Jack Daniels T shirt and when it arrived 3 weeks later, it was a polyester/jersey material with the cheapest silk screen job done on it. I would never recommend this product to anyone. Spend a little more money and get a real shirt. This looks like a Halloween costume. Very disappointed.",1
585520,"I thought the front of the dress would all be lace, but it really has almost an eight shaped pattern to the front. When I looked back at the photos after it arrived I could tell a little on the initial photo,but the second or third photos are not true true to what I received. I returned the dress. Fit was fine, material was cheap feeling, and it is NOT what I consider navy blue but rather a deep royal blue.",2
802259,"This dress was super foxy!! The split up the side wasn't obvious, but was sexy in more of an inconspicuous way. The shoulder straps were lovely, and the bottom of the dress flowed in a very feminine way! Unfortunately, I did not end up wearing it out as I just didn't have the... erm... ""boobage"" to fill the cups and be confidant of not spilling out some time during the evening, so I consigned it. If your girls are on the larger side, this dress ROCKS!",5
19921,I bought this hat for my 4 1/2 month old as soon as we had our first sunny day this spring. He has a small head and I have had a hard time finding stuff that fits.  This hat is awesome because there is a pull tab in the back that can adjust the hat size. I love that it has SPF in it and it's cute to boot! Great hat to protect a summer baby from the sun!,4
500620,Item shipped on time and looks great. bought this for my son but before I could give it to him I had to file the tips they were very sharp. Should have some kinda warning letting buyers know that item has sharp edges and to be careful. Other then that nice item.,2
818980,"Got it as a gift for my mom and she loves it. I was impressed that I got such a quality swim-suit at this price. She usually wears a L though, and this was a plus size suit but it fit her well. She rocks it! Usually these retro swim-suits cost upwards to $80, this was a steal!",5
125538,"In this case, the XL was too small. Now, the quality of the hat is excellent, it's exactly as advertised, but the sizings though skew on the small side. I couldn't wear it so I gave it to my nephew who liked it so there was no reason to send it back. But, other than the sizing, the hat quality was excellent, it was shipped fast, and knowing what i know about the sizes, I WOULD purchase from this seller again.",3
591955,"When ordered, I didn't realize the measurements were in centimeters. So be aware that this item is extremely small. I thought I had ordered a 5.5 inch metal pin to wear in a friend's wedding..not the case. Not worth 29.99 if you ask me. The item itself is pretty. Just useless to what I need it for.",3
620278,I love this dress and fits perfectly.  I am large chested so I always get nervous ordering from China.  But this dress has nice material and I love the fit but does need a waist belt or cardigan over it as it seems puffy when worn without something but I love the dress over all as I am not opposed to layering.,5
300137,"I like this ring. I've had 2 qalo rings before and both broke before 9 months of use. I've had this ring a few months and it hasn't given me any issues. I hunt and fish so it's pretty important to have a silicon ring that isn't going to rip and fall off. I also like the inside design of the ring, no one sees it but me but still I like it.",5
347144,"This dress is exactly what it seems. I felt like a star in this dress. I wore it to my engagement party a few weeks ago. I absolutely love it. I wear a size 12 and ordered a 14. It was perfect. It just falls on me. Because the front of the dress is low cut....to keep it elegant, I didn't get it fitting. Great buy. I went based on the reviews.... Trust me. The reviews don't lie.",5
686185,"My son loves this shirt. He wears it every week. After a few washings, the lettering has faded somewhat, but it still looks great. The material is very nice. It's the kind that doesn't wrinkle too easily. Smooth material and a great fit are the most you can ask for in a tshirt and this shirt has it! Also, my son was apprehensive about wearing a v neck, but the v in this shirt is not too deep so he is still comfortable in it.",4
560274,"Way too small. Very poor quality. Will tear if I wore it once itself. The picture is different from the product received. It does not come with the white insert, just only the pink overall. Very disappointed. Wanted to return but since it comes from China, I do not want to send it back. Not worth the buy.",1
449283,"I love this belt - I wear a lot of dresses to work, so this accents the outfits very nicely and coordinates with a lot of my jewelry and other accessories.  I've had it for awhile now, and am noticing some warping in the elastic from use.  However, I've had many store-bought belts do the same in much less time, so it's nothing to be alarmed about.",5
386743,"After reading other reviews I decided to get a size bigger than I would normally buy. It fits but it is a little to big for me. There is a lot of extra material, it kind of sags at the top, maybe with a smaller size it wouldn't. Overall the quality and style are great and I plan on keeping it! I'm considering purchasing another smaller one so just compare the fit!",4
353412,These laces are good looking and fit my tall work boots but one of the laces has already broken in two places making me question the quality of the leather they use.  I have only worn them a handful of times.  There are probably better quality leather laces out there.,1
875901,Cute tassel keychain. The tassel is the perfect size that I can find my keys on the bottom of my purse without being too clunky. The loop is a little on the smaller side so it is more for looks than function. Very pretty light blue color. Definitely would buy again.,5
141612,I really like to color of this purse and I have received many compliments. It is roomy inside and I can wear it on my shoulder with just the straps. It does not have a lot of compartments on the inside but big enough that I can put everything in containers like makeup and keep in bag.,4
159150,"Great customer service from CafePress. I paid extra for expedited shipping and the shirt arrived a day late, CafePress refunded me all of the shipping cost. The shirt is great as well. While it is a tad bit smaller than tbe average ""large"", it fits me just fine. Love it!",5
528223,Cool shirt. I got a large because I wanted a looser fit and because of my 26Fs the medium would've hugged that area too tightly. I wore it with a pair of white Gap straight legged jeans and ballerina slippers and looked really hot. I've also worn the same outfit but with gladiator style sandals and it still looked cute.,5
148252,"I can't believe what great quality this ring is. We eloped and only had a very limited time to buy our rings, and when we were browsing jewellery stores many of them didn't have the correct size or we felt the rings were outrageously priced. A quick amazon search drew me to this ring and we couldn't believe the quality of it when it arrived. We were going to 'upgrade' our wedding bands once we had more time after eloping but my husband likes this so much he's decided to keep it!",5
605818,"I didn't realize these shoes don't have GorTex lining, so they're not waterproof. I use them as daily shoes and for hiking.  I'll look for a different pair with GorTex for trail use.  I like the color and the speed lacing system.  They provide enough cushioning for all day use.  I prefer the mid-ankle height to full size boots.",4
194474,Don't know where to start....this is extraordinary.  I have so many pieces that are actually worth so much more than this but are nowhere near being so beautiful.  I have had people stop me in fine dining establishments just to get a closer look at this piece and compliment me on how wonderful it looks.  Love it as my go to piece when I want to impress and stand out in a crowd.,5
317958,"I love these pants. I originally was worried about the sizing because i have small waist to hip ratio and wear sizes 2-4, so i ordered a small. It fit perfect and the attached belt/wrap allows you to cinch it smaller. There is a zipper on the side of the hip area. They came a bit wrinkled but the wrinkles went away once i put them on and wore them for a few minutes. Great fabric and very comfy.",5
199990,"I enjoyed buying this s*** to wear around publicly and I like the bit of attention I get from bible thumpers. It does fit pretty good for a large set guy, the feel of the material is very soft and has good quality in keeping it nice after a few washes, to me it did not shrink still fits from when I first wore it. I would recommend any Atheist to buy this shirt. It is great for a conversation and a good laugh.",5
14799,"These are the best for people with arch problems. Wish they were cheaper since the insoles have, on occasion, cost more than the shoes I'm putting them in...but they are worth it. They hold up well, too. I keep a few pairs in rotation and swap them between pairs of shoes as I need. They do take up quite a bit of space in the shoe, so I save them for sneakers and boots. Not great for slim profile or tight fitting shoes.",5
424250,"My gf loves anything mushroom, so I thought this would be a nice valentines day gift that would surprise her.
She liked it a lot.  It sparkles pretty nice and seems to be well made but I confess, I don't know a lot about navel piercings.
It takes about 3 weeks to get it in the United States so order it early.",5
458631,"I got this and love this! this is a great style. very sexy and stylish.

Besides, I love their service when I had to return one of the two items because of the size.

They were so quick in their response and actually the fastest, in returning their money among any other companies

I've ever experienced so far. Recommend this dress and the company is so trust worthy!! Thank you!",5
881401,"This bra fits great but the band is a little snugger than I expected. This is the one of the best sports bras Ive ever bought but theres almost no bounce. The straps, I thought were a little too long at first, even at the tightest setting but I realized that if it were any tighter it would probably cause a lot of aches after a wearing it a while so its actually perfect the way it is. For reference: Im 53, 125lbs and 34D",5
285091,"Wow! Thought I ordered the multi-set, and I will when back in stock, BUT received the 4 large. These are quality bags that I can see multiple uses for - especially for our Registered Pet Therapy Teams. We are looking at the stroller bags now. Several of our teams use strollers for smaller dogs and cats while visiting hospitals and care facilities. I can see that a great advantage for freeing our arms, but still bringing our essentials into the facility for us and the pets! Thank You DotDotTravel.",5
732705,"I generally take an XL, so I figured an XXL would fit, especially since it was described as fitting a 40""/45"" chest.  Wrong.  There's no way this fits that chest size.  It's too bad because the silk itself is lovely--very smooth and solid.  I loved the feel of it, but it fit me like a casing for sausage.  I sent it back.",2
286259,"I love these pants! So comfortable! A little long but probably fine after I wash and dry. If not, I just have to wear my higher heeled shoes. Exactly as I had hoped. Falls beautifully off the derriere and full enough to have a smooth line all the way to the heel. Very pleased, hoping there are other colors available? I'd love some in navy or a dark sage...",5
569816,ok im very fit and the dress is amazing however its a tad see through it the chest and you can see every nook cranny and dimple also im 5 7 and even with heels the train in back is to the floor and for someone tall this was unexpected and never happens very happy with this dress but would suggest a slip of somekind,4
755019,"It was overall made of good materials, but you really need to spend time getting measured to have it fit right. I'm a pretty standard 40R guy, and I've always fit ""medium"" clothese, but when it came the proportions were really off. The people that make it are super nice though, and were willing to alter it for no extra cost. The armor provided isn't really worth having and were held in the jacket with nylon pockets that can get pretty itchy. I would suggest just ordering it as a good looking cosplay jacket.",4
35792,"I bought this because I needed a bunch for spots like the car, bike, garage, spots where they'd get a lot of abuse. They are good but wouldn't recommend them for all day use, bit too thick and heavy. But if you want a spare pair for the car or around the house than yes very good.",3
90172,"I bought this watch for my Son and he loved it, wore it everyday and it was a big hit with his friends. However after he had it three weeks he laid it on his dresser as he did every night, when he got up in the morning the clock face had shifted and it no longer works.",3
426455,"Item looked exactly like it did in the photo, and fit true to size. The colors are vibrant, and they didn't fade after the first wash, os i'm taking that as a good sign. Hahaha. I'm very happy with this purchase, and would choose to buy from them in the future.",5
335919,"Myself and the other groomsmen needed blue jackets to match the color scheme of the wedding. This was an excellent value, it fit within traditional U.S. sizing, and I looked pretty damn good. Outdoor wedding (Southern California in June), but this wasn't too hot to be in most of the day. I have worn it since and am glad I bought it.",5
811504,"I absolutely LOVE this swimsuit! The sizes are a bit strange but overall, it is very nice, comfortable, and well made. it held the girls in properly and helped make my stomach look not as large!

436582,"I was looking for a scarf with at least some Pashmina in it. This scarf advertised pashmina. I noticed that different colors appeared to be made of different materials, so I browsed through them. I bought the grey one that advertised  70% PASHMINA, 30% Silk. When I received the scarf the tag says 50% viscose and 50% acrylic. This is false advertising and makes me so mad, and I think that Amazon should not allow this seller to sell on Amazon anymore!!! It gives me a bad taste for Amazon as well as this seller!",2

I took a few minutes and filed them down . . . and now am not in danger of stabbing myself in the neck if I answer the phone.  Great price for these lovely earrings!",5
831637,"Let me first say that everything about this skirt is good quality and well-made. Everything intrinsic is excellent. That being said, the length and/or the flair...

584992,"Just got this on Friday and put it on while going out the weather was beautiful it fit perfect covered my hair completely where i was able to go out and not fear the sun at all, silky texture of it, yes i will definitely buy this again, warning though for woman who do not have long hair like mine or have baby fine hair this will be big on you, it's made that way on purpose so you can cover your full head without worrying about headaches from it being to tight.",5
469443,"Loved the fit, looked very 20's. The sequins were falling off before I walked out the door, and the are not sewn individually, so once one comes off, the thread is loose for more, and more and more.  After 4 hours of wearing  I had a 5x5 bare spot and then some others randomly around the dress.  When you consider the price and it is just a costume, no surprise.  AND I would order again but I would order in time to check sequins and resew them, because it was a cute dress.",3
52210,"Very cute hat, and seems well made. I needed something to fit my 3-month old's head, and unfortunately this was still a bit large. She doesn't have a particularly small head either. The drawstring that allows you to tighten it definitely helped and I was able to make it work. I wouldn't recommend this for newborns or tiny babies, but 6m + would probably be perfect.",3
332323,"My daughter is 6' tall. It's hard to find dresses long enough. This dress is extremely long and arrived un hemmed. The dress fit great, per the size chart. Yea!!! Well made EXCEPT for some rather puckered side seams on the skirt. That's why I give it just 3 stars. It would also be nice to know that the dress does not have a finished hem. Color shown in photo is accurate. Makes your bust line look good even if small chested. Has a back zip. Back of dress is high enough to wear a standard bra without showing.",3
805211,"I really like this watch, it's extremely unique and I haven't seen anything like it before!  The band material is extremely soft and comfortable and it blends with any outfit perfectly!  Resting my wrist is so much more comfortable then my normal rubber band of my fitness watch.  Easy to set it's just a really classy and unique watch. Highly satisfied!

I was very surprised when I received it, it looked just like the one in the picture, plus the material wasn't cheap made, although I ordered a small they sent me a medium but it fit so I'm happy. Very cute and very much worth the money.",5
58011,This did the trick for me. I have a pair of Saucony sneakers that are almost a half size too big on only my right foot. Adding a couple of these to the tongue of the sneaker helped remove that space and push my heel to the back of the shoe.,5
375464,"5'4 /152lbs/34C Overall the cover up fits well, I ordered the green & blue material isn't as flowing as pictured, I do not like the black lace on the bottom of the green cover-up which is not pictured or added in the description it looks cheap, will probably remove it. The blue cover-up came as pictured it's pretty fits well, no complaints",3
860881,Fits just as expected. Really comfortable. Very cute. If would be even cute if the front black piece detached when you wanted it to. For just a bikini option for laying out. But it is very cute anyway. Loved the packaging. It comes in a small plastic cute zip bag with raindrops on it. And it shipped quick. Thanks,5

412808,"Very nice, the way it is made flatters any figure. I wear this all the time when it rains. Looks good with any outfit. This is worth buying. Also comes with its own carrying pouch which is helpful for carrying in a backpack or purse, because it makes it easy to find when it's needed.",5
171934,"It is a $5 ring did you really expect. It to be real silver, or even silver plated?!? It is a cute accent piece not to be worn everyday. Also if you paint it with clear top cote nail polish then it prevents it from wear and turning your finger green.
IT'S A $5 RING WHAT FO YOU EXPECT",2
353809,"I thought it looked so cute on, however, you have to put it together.  After a couple of tries to slide the ears on it worked great.  That means that you can position the ears at any position you want so that's a good thing as well.  You con open up the ears or squish them together.",5
282743,My wife said it looked like a washer.  It's ok and does the job - I was homeliness it wouldn't irritate my skin and it didn't until I wore leather gloves to chop wood and it really aggravated my skin then.  Otherwise it's good and does the job fine.,3
57726,"This item is great. I have been using it for about a month now with no issues. It fits my ID well, is very easy to carry around.

I only gave them 4 stars because I think it's stupid that they only offer them in one size..",4

I was worried that they wouldnt be able to keep the stretch but they are sturdy, and still very soft! They were wider at the flare but I like that. Theyre PERFECT for people with larger ear lobes. I would buy from this company again.",5
348223,"Is very sexy but just runs very small. I am 5'11 and size 10 and it looked darn sexy from far away, my husband loved it, but close up it was cutting into me almost painfully and causing muffin top spillage. So buy it and love it if you are size 6-8 or smaller.",3
396194,"So far so good. I just got this today and have used it to cover a sofa cushion that gets a lot of use as back support. It's a lovely pattern and color.

193241,Love these...going to be ordering another pair..got the the first day of my crossfit class and feet never felt better...great support for my daily walks and for my class. Just wish they would come in colors to where with my non workout clothes. I normally love my salomon's but love these.,5
428901,"Excellent quality. Every stitch is perfect. The weight of the fabric feels just right. My measurements fell into two size categories, so I ordered the smaller of the sizes. That goes against the conventional wisdom of buying a size larger, but this is not a t-shirt or button-up. This is tied with ties. You can tie it with more slack to make it bigger. You can't, however, make it smaller.",5
276798,"I bought these sunglasses to replace an expensive pair of polarized sunglasses that broke. The lens is a little too dark for me at times, if the sun is in your face it can be hard to see out of them. But they're definitely polarized and are very fashionable. I have gotten many complements on this pair. Would buy again.",4
572058,I'm terribly disappointed with the construction of this dress. I ordered it as a prom dress for my daughter and we received it with the arm being put on inside out. I set it aside to return it before we went on vacation and forgot about it and missed the 30 day window to return it so now we are stuck with a dress that cannot be worn. I paid good money for it and it's very poor quality.,1

464818,"I like the swimsuit , the only bad thing the color pink is not what you think and the leapord print is not as pretty as shown. It's still cute though I wear it alot only bad thing the padding is super wierd and uncomfortable it kinda feels like cardboard not a pushup.",3
136396,"I lose sunglasses like crazy, so this seemed like it might be the answer.  But I totally expected them to be ridiculous looking like most I've seen.

But these are great, nothing like the rest.  You truly can hardly tell what's going on there.  Plus they are very lightweight and sturdy.  I'm ordering a few more, just to keep them handy.",5
878355,"Little tight for a large but still fits. Kind of feel like I'm wearing a skirt so you can definitely dress these up. Make note though, I'd they're tight, you can see the shiny part of the shorts under the lace which is kind of annoying.

Update 9/5/16
These have already ripped. I had to throw them away. Cheap!",3
699938,"Received it in one week. Surprised!!!This sweater is very nice.the material is soft and fits just right. Pattern is stylish and classic. I love the design and how thick it is. I wear it all the time. It's exactly the same as the picture and was flattering on. I would highly recommend this sweater to anyone.
Happy with this purchase!",5
30035,"i received my ring in the mail today and i love it.
its much daintier in person than it is in the photos.
the gemstone isn't perfect. it has a slight line running through the middle, but i don't mind. its a gemstone.
gemstones aren't perfect. i think it adds to the ring.
if you want a flawless stone, like a diamond, i suggest you don't buy this.
but if you are happy with a little 'rustic' look, go for it. i love it :D",5
648553,"I really like the colors, the pattern, and the style of this maxi dress.  However, the fit was WAY too small.  I ordered a size XL.  It arrived and looked like it would barely fit a XL in Juniors sizes.  I had to give to my niece who loves it and looks beautiful in it.  It's a great and versatile piece but just didn't fit me.  I was able to purchase this at a discount and am happy to share with you in return my experience and feedback.",4
203754,"100% cotton and soft. Fits as expected. Our baby loves it! The price is great compared to other 100% cotton sleepers we've found, and it's one of the few one piece cotton sleepers we've been able to find (with feet in them) in our son's 12-18 month size. I'm very glad we purchased these! They've held up great to multiple washings and still look brand new after lots of near daily use! Will definitely buy again!",5

The inside is a light grey/white. So, the product is not black dyed all the way through. The outside is black with the white colored fabric skull mask design. I would recommend this product to protect the neck and face as a light layer. Fast shipping and excellent service. Thank you.",5

No tarnish to the ring either! No crooked stones, uneven bands or any cosmetic damage at all.
I'll post another update in about 3 months on whether the quality stays the same or not.",5

There's a warning on the website and in the care of Birkenstocks info you receive...but it isn't covered by warranty.  I wouldn't buy another pair because I would like my sandals to survive in the heat of Montana...,1

The lace and look of the dress is beautiful, very soft and fits well if you order it bigger then your usual size. shipped faster then they said it would. Looks great with a jean jacket and cowboy boots to give it a cute country wedding look!",3
823851,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this swim suit! It's sexy and it's modest at the same time! My husband loved it too! The only drawback is that my breasts are large so the string around my neck was holding on for dear life.

With my hotel keys in the wallet i could not open the door....even if i pressed it up against the lock. I then put the keys in another wallet holder and the door opened. Good enough for me. Bought the pink color and it is so vibrant, just what i was looking for in the color.",5

638017,"Really love this dress! It is beautifully made and just what my daughter was looking for in a Homecoming dress. She is very slender, and was fitting between sizes at the boutiques we went to. The corset back allowed her to cinch it in to just the right fit! The beads are well attached and the color is true to what is shown. Couldn't be happier with how this purchase worked out.",5
44302,"I wear and 8-8 1/2 normally but I buy these in a size 9. I have owned 3 pairs. They are extremely comfortable, they go with anything and I can wear them all night. I have literally danced for hours, walked miles and ran in these shoes. I've taken them to burning man and every halloween they go with multiple costumes. I like that they help keep you warm when the rest of you may be more exposed in a cute costume. I love them! Getting a size up has been the perfect fit for me.",5
100554,"Who wouldn't want this horse mask? It reeks of Latex when you first receive it, and I could hardly breathe in it, but I just soaked it in some hot water (without getting the ""fur"" wet) and that worked pretty well for it, good investment for scaring kids and the elderly.",5
397505,"My 18-year old son wanted this cross for his birthday and loves it to this day.

However, within a month, the chain broke.  I figured it was no big deal, I'd go buy one from a store.  WRONG.

It's not sterling, nor a type of silver finish that ""matches"" anything in the stores that I could find.

I tried a leather rope, but that didn't work too well either.

My son now has it hanging in his room and it's irritating that he can't wear it.

Otherwise, it's a lovely cross if that's what you're searching for.",3

Other than that i loved the product.",5
360609,"Finally got that ""back-hurter"" wallet out of my back pocket and went with this one.  Obviously, it doesn't hold as much as a normal wallet, but it made me purge all the stuff I really don't need and carry around what is necessary.  It's great for putting in one of your front pockets.  I also like that it has RFID blocking.",5

669609,"The fabric is T shirt thickness, definitely not a sweatshirt at all. The design is as pictured, but not sharp, images are fuzzy. I ordered the one that looks like a rainbow saturn and has spacemen on it. It fits, I usually wear a small and it is listed as medium.

69568,"Very cute and great price! I'm a teacher, and this was fun to wear on Halloween. My only complaint is that it's plain blue in the back. In my opinion, it should say Crayola on the front and back. That's what crayons look like. The crayon wrapper goes all the way around. With this costume, it's hard to tell what you are from the back.",4
417513,"love the socks esp the length. My boots are rather high and these don't disappear into the shaft after hiking several hours. They are nice and thick for cushion. For warm weather hiking, I prefer the bamboo much to wool. This my second pair and I'm about to order another one.",5
688868,"The quality is great and it arrived at my house very quickly! But its smaller than I expected, even ordering one size larger it turned out just fitting around my chest and arms.

128633,"This jacket is exactly what I was looking for! It's very lightweight and easy to fold/roll up if you are traveling. I normally wear a small in shirts, but I bought a medium after reading the reviews. I am very glad I did! I can wear a sweater or sweatshirt underneath if it is chilly or with just a t-shirt if it is warm out. I love this jacket!",5

The one who sewed my shorts probably has never done it before. The shorts have a defect in them, the Length of the left and right sides of the Shorts differ per inch from the inside, and from the outside - by a half-inch! Besides, the quality of seams is awful!
I am very disappointed!",1

560857,"These leggings are so much fun, especially as a nursing student! One of the best $5 purchases I ever made. They are not the best quality--material is a little thin, and they don't come up as far in the back as they do in the front (i.e. do not buy if you have an ample booty, but my dancer butt is covered just fine). However, they fit well, and while some people think they're a little weird, I get compliments on them whenever I wear them.",4
857605,"I ordered a medium (5'4"" 150lbs) it was way too small. The tag had the size cut off so I am not even sure if I actually got a medium.  The suit was very cute. And the color was bright and exactly what I expected.  I'm bummed it didn't fit.",3
744162,"I followed the size chart at the end of the suit photos, and the fit was comfortable.  I tried both the green and pink suits,and the colors were just a bit richer than pictured.  The fabric is sturdy and dries quickly.  It was perfect for the mineral spa I visited.  Modest, comfortable, simple style, a good value for the money.",4
109775,I like these soft plastic squeeze coin holders.  The soft plastic takes little effort to open to accept or extract coins.

Great gift for daughter,mother, girl friend,etc.",5

504082,I bought this for a trip on Queen Mary 2 sailing from NY to Southampton.  I used it for the Masquerade Ball and it certainly adds a sparkle and bling to an outfit.  I managed to fit my pocket camera in there.  Really pleased with this item.,5
600170,"The print is really cute, but the material is too slinky and stretchy, sort of like a thin kid's bathing suit material.
It's only ""one size"", and it barely fit me.  I'm 5'7"", 130lb.  If you are young and don't have hips, it might be nice for you.  Because of my hips, it would not stay pulled down, and rode up with every movement.
I wore it a couple of times because I liked the pattern so much, but the dye would rub off on my skin!  Had to get rid of it.",2
331996,"I like it though I may have to put an extra hole in it to make it fit. I ordered a size larger as recommended too. The belt had a musty smell or maybe moldy, as if it had been stored in a moist area. It is now outside to sit in the sun a few days before I can wear it. I suppose it will be fine when I can get it to fit properly and stop making my wife react asthmatically with its bad smell.",4

The flower is a dusty pink and the hat itself is a soft cream color, and the leaves are an olive green. I LOVE the pearl in the center of the flower, it's the perfect finishing touch. The quality of the hat is outstanding, very soft and thick knit. I will cry when my daughter outgrows this.",5

Not quite as thin as I'd hoped, although I've got about 12 cards in it, so I shouldn't be too surprised.  That said, it IS thin, and it's easy to get cards in and out.  The side pocket for bills and checks is also great.  No complaints!",5

I am probably going to buy a couple different colors now. Just love the classic fit and how modest it is.",5

They are completely useless with one of my pairs of shin guards (which are admittedly large), and I can only wear them with my smaller pair.

Also, the fabric is quite thin to begin with and I suspect it won't hold up for very long. My advice is go for something a little more expensive that is fully functional and will last.",2
214016,"Material is not good quality. It is too tight up at the top. This dress is suppose to drape effortlessly and it does not. The bag it came in says 'sample' and I did not order a sample. the front and back at the bottom are even in height and from the photo, the front is draped in such a way that it starts low, goes up a little an then back down low. That is not what I have. They tried to imitate the design and failed. Do not order from them. I never will again.",1
799345,"This product is the most poorly manufactured product I've ever received. The bust and butt are not proportional, and if you get the suit to fit one part, you will not have it adjusted to fit the other. The black strips are also way smaller than they appear in the picture. And the suit as a whole is not intuitive at all. Hated it.",1
287557,I ordered XL.  It was to small.  Maybe XL for most of the catwalk models.  I put it on my 9 year old who is a skinny pole.  It was just a little big on her.  To me it was not worth it to ship back as they do not have bigger size.  I gifted it to a smaller person.  Now to find one for me.,2

I asked my girlfriend the big question and this beautiful ring now rests on her hand, proving to be exactly what she had wanted.

I received this product Free for my honest and unbiased review and that does not change my opinion about this product.",2
461953,"It's a cute shirt and the material is ok, it's a silky feeling shirt that is well made. It fit as expected but it hung a little funny on me, I'm thinking it will look better as a layering piece with a cute camisole under it. They do give you a sash thing which just ties around your waist to bring more shape to the shirt, so you can choose to use it or not which gives it some versatility.",3
668474,"What a piece of crap.  First I had a hard time trying to hook it, and then when I finally got it hooked the link broke right off instantly.  for no reason.  Do not waste your money.  It's so cheaply made, it's pathetic.  I don't like writing bad reviews, but this item is a rip off item.",1
152356,"It's funny, it fits nothing like in the picture. It's really just a bag of a dress with a nice belt piece attached to it. I didn't think much of it but decided to wear it  to an informal occasion anyway and everyone loved it, they thought it was the cutest thing. Must be the print. Fit aside, the fabric is pretty nice and very comfortable, just don't expect it to fit like in the picture.",3
198059,"It didn't fit well. The bra is made of very rigid material that's why my boobs looked like triangles//. I wouldn't recommend it. Anyway what was I expecting for this price. However, customer service is nice. They sent me wrong color and I didn't like it therefore they refund me half of the money and let me keep the swimming suit as well.",2
687526,All reviews are right. The dress looks nothing like the picture and is way too short. I am 5'3 115 lbs. I told my mom I will probably just wear it as a nightgown. Lesson learned will solely stick to reviews before I make another purchase like this one. The only positive thing was fast shipping,1
47002,"When I received these, I was surprised that they are two separate muffs, with nothing connecting them. Guess I didn't read the description carefully enough. They go on the ears like socks go on feet - one at a time and the ears go into the muffs.. After using these, I think they are better than traditional ear muffs that just push against the ears. It takes a little practice to get them on but they look good and keep the ears warm.",5
847511,Fit was as expected for my 5 year old. I had bought her a nude color body suit last Halloween for her troll outfit and I used it again underneath this for a little more modesty since we were trick or treating and not just at home. She loves using it for dress up now and can't wait to wear the swim suit bottoms this summer.,5

(I'm 5'6"", 140lbs, 36D, size 6/8) The material is a bit stiff which is weird, but it's actually very flattering. The cut is great - and the length is perfect. Pretty much hits as you see it on the model. Colors are also very much how you see them in the pic here - dark military greens/browns.",5
267194,"Received before Christmas which I was told would come after January 1st. Very pleased. There are  2 negative things, first they do look cheap, you get what you pay for.

301874,"A little tight, but not bad. I like the cotton to spandex ratio BC it makes them more flattering and not able to see flaws like a lot of leggings. The thickness of the material is good too. They fit above the hips so I don't have to keep pulling them up. They go past the ankles. Great buy especially for two!!",4
774417,Disappointing. Bought this for my formal and it was beautiful but too big and the fabric appeared more expensive in the image than it tangibly was. Didn't want the hassle of returning the dress. Maybe one day i'll get it tailored for me. That way it won't be a waste of money.,2

Nice enough for a grown up to enjoy and use, as well!",5
33143,"Although this is the fourth Diamond Plate TM product I have purchased, this one did not come close to the quality I'd come to expect.  The material is peeling & separating after only 3 months & my daughter wearing it less than a dozen times. It started happening just a week after the return window, so now I'm stuck with a jacket bought as a birthday present that she won't wear!",1
749113,"My wife is a small and this thing was very small. She won't be wearing it because it fit like a spandex gym shirt. It's too bad because it's nicely made and is very stylish. I would reccomend getting at least a size up.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review",2
245016,"I purchased this the other day when Amazon had lowered the price, I found it through some deal site. I thought it was really cute. The only bad thing is the string bracelets are too small for me to wear. They are made for a baby. I guess I must have overlooked that part since I was just looking at the pin, not the ribbons. So, oh well, I guess I'm stuck with a useless piece of ribbon that is only going to sit and collect dust!",3
389878,"These fit large yet the waistband is too tight, if that makes sense. The package says mid-rise, but they seem like full rise to me. The leg openings also lack adequate elastic to keep them from loosening through the day. Cool concept, but many improvements needed. I guess that's why they're on clearance already at discount retailers.",2
73125,"I have three other hat.  Two Australian style, the other one not sure what style it is.  This hat looks sharp, people compliment me whenever I wear it.  The most important think is how well it keeps me dry in the rain and I haven't been able to test it yet.  Will write a follow in the Fall season.",4
713302,"This handbag is nothing short of fabulous.  Very chic look.  It is made with exercising material,  very spacious inside with enough smaller compartments that I was able to organize it very well.  Very convenient shoulder strap that adjusts to whatever length you're comfortable with our you can just remove it and use the shoulder straps when you want it held close.  I love the design and am proud to be seen with it!",5
18729,"The rim of the hat falls in my child's face.  My child can't wear the hat because he can't see where he is walking.  The hat literally hangs down over his eyes and nose. Awful hat.  Disappointed thoroughly.  The rim isn't stiff enough to stick out like it should, it just droops down over my child's face!",1
540844,"These are so cute! Wonderful training underwear, the inside is just terrycloth which won't completely save you from accidents but just enough to catch them before it gets too far. My daughter also hates wearing the ones with the PVC layer inside because it crinkles and I guess she doesn't like the feel, but she has no issue with these since they are still soft like underwear.",5
841564,"Absolutely LOVE these pants! I seriously want them in every color. They are a TAD thin material wise, but that just makes them perfect for wearing through the summer IMO. They go great with tunics, tank tops and they can be dressed up or down. These are absolutely my go-to pants!",5
708327,"I loved it! It fit as expected...but,gave 4 stars because the feathers did come off...not enough to ruin the skirt but i did leave a trail on the dance floor! lol...The way the skirt is made your leg movement is a bit restricted due to lining underneath feathers...but i just cut slits on each side,problem solved!",4
297299,"I haven't experienced any of the issues with skin discoloration that other people have referenced, but yeah, the sizing can be a little weird. The quality is what you expect for the price, but I've ordered other rings at this price point that have broken after a few wears and these have not. They came very quickly with standard shipping. The fact that they're not super bulky is great for me, because I type all day.",5
288576,Bought two sets. First set one clip wouldn't clip out of the box. This was disappointing. So I used some pliars to crimp it and that lasted for about a month.  Then they broke and snapped. Bought another set and one of the clips doesn't clip again...not happy at all,1
611636,"I read the reviews a head of time and saw that it runs a little small. I'm normally a large in dresses so I got a xxlarge to be safe, given that things with lace usually fit to size. It was wayy too tight and small. It's unfortunate because other than that it's really cute :(",2
232791,UPDATE: I have owned this wallet for several months now.  I bought it for my current deployment with the Army to the Middle East.  I am in and out of this wallet several times a day and it has held up perfectly!  Perfect for holding credit cards! Just as little and awesome as pictured.  I am tempted to buy a few more for when it does finally break down on me.  I love it that much and don't want to go back to any other wallet.,5

It has decent similarity to the picture, cute but won't keep baby warm enough, do it will be be worn over a thick sweater, more of a trendy than warm coat.",3
543574,"It looked nothing like the picture. It was a totally different green than it appeared. I could have handled that, but the rose pattern and color was completely differenttoo. The handles weren't green to match the purse either. They were a natural creamy color. The seller wouldn't let me return it, because it wasn't defective. I only gave 3 stars because they did refund half of my money. I told them i wouldn't have paid that much money to get a purse that looked like the on i received.",3
757789,"I really like this top; the material is thinner than what I was expecting, but not enough so that I minded. Overall, a very nice top. My only true complaint is that it didn't come in additional colors - I love the purple, but it would be nice to buy more that don't look exactly the same.",5
304567,"Very disappointing. Wanted to return,  but never received an answer from the vendor on how to. I have the large Gloria. When I read 'one size'  I was not aware that they made a small version. My 4 year old granddaughter found it very amusing to having a miniature version of mine. I was purchasing it as a gift for her mother but it really looks like it is made for a small child.",1
153652,the ring it looks nice on amazon  but what i got was a cheapy ring that you could adjust like you get out of gumball machines and not swarski crystal at all cheap looking and easily broken. I bought for my granddaughters but was unable to give them to them.,1
382254,"I just got these as back up parts mostly for my favored pieces. Occasionally, the dangled pieces come loose, and sometimes fancier belly jewelry doesn't come with a matching upper jewel, so I swap out the plain jewel for the like color, and this assortment has every color. These look good to wear as is too.

A few were a bit stiff to twist off at first. I just covered them with a cloth and gently used needle nose pliers to loosen them up. No problems after that.",5
11660,"A good friend recommended these because I walk for 10 hours a night at work and my feet hurt after every shift, said they worked great for him. They didn't work for me, after about 5 hours of walking with these in my shoes not only my feet but also my knees and back were killing me, I took them back out and will never put them back in again.",1
704589,It wasn't what i was expecting. The material is a some what see through and the top doesn't fit right and  if you have big bust it's a no no because  the middle of the top opens wide and if you wear a bra you can see it. I ordered a Sz L and I'm 150lbs and  wear a 38C bra.,1
662349,Chinese manufacturing at its finest. Cant' see through it - very dark. The visor cracked as I was taking off the protective film and paper (which is very difficult to get off). The mechanism that holds the visor up stopped doing so after trying it on and the visor would fall. Buy something else.,2
311242,"When the item arrived it was not the color shown. It is, in fact, much lighter almost silver. The clicker is very difficult and moves in other directions not just up and down into the slot. Still a beautiful septum ring, however. Happy with much purchase overall but the picture is misleading.",2
426837,"I got this to go with that funny color we all love that some say is blue and others say is purple? You know what I mean I'm sure! Well, it isn't that color at all. It is a very purple - pink set. That little hint of purple-blue....no. Not at all. Much more ofa rose-purple with dashes of pale pink. So be warned.

Otherwise, it is a wonderful set. Very nice quality and beautiful. I kept mine because I love the sets from this seller. So I have to get something to match it...poor me!",4
840904,The shirt was extra extra small and the wording was extremely blurry; actually doubled. To try and read it would give you a headache. I use the shirt as a dust rag as the owner refused an exchange and was only willing to give a partial refund of $11 whole dollars.,1

My 2 1/2 year old had difficulty holding onto the umbrella during a particularly strong gust of wind during a recent rainstorm, but she quickly recovered once the wind died down. I would recommend this umbrella.",5
816953,"It was a lovely dress, I got a TON of compliments on it! However it was pretty poorly made, my seams kept tearing and there was an awkward poof of fabric in the front of the gown, across the ruching that hadn't been sewn down. It was comfortable and pretty but I wish it was better made, I was afraid I was going to accidently tear off the sleeves or mess up the bodice seams. Unfortunately, I can only wear this gown once out of fear of tearing it after a second use.",3
554736,Bought them for my wife and she loves them!  The fit is perfect and the quality is as high as it gets!  Another win for Amazon!  I recommend this set of tank tops to all women who love the sleek feel and look of tank tops.  Way to go Amazon!,5

339462,"The hats were a hit! They fit great. Even on a 7 3/4"" - 7 5/8"" sized head like mine. They looked fantastic. The hats were quite comfortable, also.  The good far outweigh the not so good. The one ""not so good"" was that one wire to the battery compartment came loose. It was easily remedied. An inconvenience, none the less. The battery case tucks into the white brim. It's not secured so can fall out and hang when not being worn. Definitely would & will purchased next year.",5
113593,Did not like the material of these at all. I  gave them to my daughter since the sizing wasn't great either.  She didn't like them either. I wouldn't buy these again.  The material is the type that shows everything.  Not made for a woman with curves at all.  lol,1
713501,"I like this vest alot, but unfortunately I took everyone's advice and ordered a size larger than I normally wear. It's loose in all the wrong places. Tried to shrink it but it didn't work. But it was cheap enough, I think I'll just order it again in a small.",4
345840,"This was probably the most disappointing product I've ever received from Amazon. I ordered an XL, and it fit like a small medium. I probably could get away with wearing mediums, but I like my shirts to fit loose so I normally get larges and XL's. I still wore this, but there weren't any tags to give any information about the material and what the proper washing instructions were. So here's to hoping washing and drying it are okay. I am upset with this product and do not recommend for purchase.",2
320777,"My wife ordered this dress to wear casually, as per her- the material is thick and soft for the price paid, design is cute, it did fit her a little snug around the chest area but she thinks it will be fine later on, and also the neck is not too deep so it works for her because you can always cover it up with a nice scarf.",4
269688,"This is very good to get the correct fit on a hat.  Buying small, medium, or large hats always leaves room for adjustment and with this i can now buy bigger and it fits.  I had trouble separating the tape cover from the tape so i took the tape that holds the roll in one piece and used it to separate the two.  Even if you are like me and just crunch it up and throw it in the box it still works.",5

This would normally upset me,  but the garment is such high quality,  and fits so nice,  performs flawlessly,  I just accept what I got.  These are really nice.  The lightning deal price was obscenely low.  Would pay much more in a store,  or outfitter of any format.",5
863350,"Purchased as a gift for my teen granddaughter. She loves it, and I did too. It is well made with it's ""patchy put together"" look.

Completely satisfied!!!!",5

The colors are not right in the design and the lion is right in the middle of my sweater- it looks awkward. Very disappointed.",1
826836,"Absolutely in love with these pants. They're super comfy and I have complete range of motion in them as well. I'm 5'9 and like to wear the waist pretty high so I do pull them a little higher above my ankles.
The pocket on the right side is too small to fit my phone which is a bummer but it has a zipper which is a plus. (:

Definitely plan on buying another pair eventually.",5
199141,"I am a small/medium frame with a B cup chest. I read the reviews and decided to order a large...it fit perfect. Its a very cute shirt.

These are much higher quality, they stayed in place the entire shift.",5

If you want just a little room to bend etc. you need to get one size up!!!  Great quality and I love it under sweaters in the winter or even just wearing it alone with jeans or as a work-out top, it's very versatile.",5
505039,"I bought this black freshwater pearl for the versatility of having a necklace that could be worn with multiple outfits. I was actually amazed at the quality when it arrived. It was more than expected. The entire necklace actually has a decent weight from the pearls and as far as beauty, absolutely gorgeous. Each pearl is unique with it's own individuality.

I'm more than happy with this necklace. Anyone looking for pearls with an affordable price that doesn't skip on quality should consider buying a necklace from this seller.",5

I ordered the US XL / Asia 2XL after reading a lot of the reviews.  The shirt did end up being perfect for me.  Not tight but not hanging or baggy.  The shirt did stay the same size now after 2 washes.  Love the shirt and would buy again.  Thanks, LRE",5
4421,"Quality is kind of what I expected from a costume...only made to wear once. The fringe isn't as full as the picture shows, a lot of the lycra sheath shows through and is see-through.

Also, it fits really small. I wear a medium or a large in most things and I ordered a large to be on the safe side to fit my larger chest...but I can barely shimmy it on over my hips! Not enough time to return so I guess I'll be wearing spanx and sucking in at my costume party.",2

224925,"I'm really happy with the bag....it's roomy without being huge and had lots of zippered pockets and a good adjustable strap. I did think it was going to be a rougher canvas type fabric, but it is more of a nylon, duffel feel. But it is still good quality and I'm happy with the purchase and price.",4
173555,"My favorite boot of all time. Great for rucking, PT, and walking in all types of environments. They are very light and are designed to help you move towards more minimalist type footware. If you wear orthotics they will fit in these too. Only downside is that they take about a week or two to fully break in. But after you do then they are perfect. -a guy in the Army",5
119049,"Despite the reviews, this shirt didn't give me any problems! I bought it in medium but it was def too big. I think the shirt was meant to be loose fitting, but I am pretty sure if I bought small this would still be loose. I normally wear medium in US size and I do not have a large chest or body (I am 5'4"" and I weigh 140).. The material is very soft and satin-y, which I do like. I wish I got it smaller, but oh well, it still looks cute on me.",5

Everything worked great for 2 days when on the third day I look down and the second hand is spinning whenever I move my hand.  Its like it has come off the center cap.

I'm not large in bust size, but the cups I find don't lift your bust upward. The weight of the silicone seems to pull my bust downward. The adhesive didn't last (worn only 1 time) & it barely made it through the evening. So if I try it again, I'll have to purchase more adhesive. I probably won't order this again.",3

51135,I out grew this very quickly!  I even went by the size chart on the website!  As other reviews state it creases in the back & makes extra rolls on top of the band.  Can not wear it under any form fitting clothes because of the crease/gold it makes.  I was so looking forward to using it too,2
338258,"Watch out for what you're buying.  The photo had sleeveless dress but then long sleeve arrived.  The dress is nicely made but very very heavy.  More of a winter or night dress.  It runs really really SMALL.  I'm a curvy large and it took 2 friends to pull it on me, too tight to wear but I may alter it because its a cool dress.",3
335033,"(writing from my husband's account) I love these boots, but they did fit a little small, so they hurt a bit. Which sucked cause I really loved the style and how well they match to just about everything. So I only knocked one star because  will need to order next size larger",4
621572,This is a very liteweight delicate dress. It has a black thin lining. The fit is wonderful. Very comfy. I had originally bought the medium which I gave to my daughter in law. She is an 8 and I am a 16 so you can see the size flexibility in tbe dress. Great for around the house.,5
871108,"I just received the vest ordered.  Surprise. I requested and pay for an XL size and received an XS.
I mean, is it that hard to differentiate a L from an S?
If the size should have been the one I ordered, I would have been really happy with this, because looks and quality are good enough for.the price.",1
766523,"These are nice pillow covers, very good quality and I like the material. However, they are not as yellow as pictured. They are a lovely honey color and I'm keeping them because they were a good price and I can figure out a place to use them. But they aren't yellow enough for the room I planned on using them in.",4
727120,"I usually wear 16 but the only options were 14 or18 so I went up. I could put on the dress without unzipping but because of the sheath style it still looks great. The neck was a little big  on me since I am not very large in thd chest. It was easy to tuck up and hide  that under the draped collar. Since I am over 60 I also appreciate the sleeves. The dress is lined, the material has stretch  and is a reasonable weight. I can't wait to wear it.",5
64955,"Wow, this stainless steel bracelet is quite a substantial piece that would normally cost more if made out of sterling. The craftmanship is superb and you ladies will just love looking at your wrist and admiring it and your reflection on it. Especially being smart for buying such a great accessory piece that others will think cost tons of money.",5
454517,Why would you state a size and not be accurate for said size? I figure this wouldnt be an issue if I got a size higher(after reading the other comments) for my small waist size but it still doesn't fit. You guys need to learn your measurements... Jacket fits perfectly though.,1
166937,5'9 155lbs and I got A medium and its a great fit! I have a really athletic build with big butt and thighs so I'm always worried about stuff being see through when I work out but these are great!! Better than I expected for the cost. Gonna order more.,5
40148,"These are nice sturdy flip-flops, not squishy as some can be.  I bought these in size BR41-42 after reading other reviews about the sizing being off.  I wear a 9.5-10 womens and the 41-42 fits just right (though it says it will fit women's size 11-12).  I don't know if the sizing issue has to do with the color -- I bought brown.  Also, on the flip-flip itself it says ""USA 9.""  Men's?  Women's?  Don't know.  But the BR41-42 will fit a women's 9-10.",4
403781,"This set is simply perfect: elegant and timeless... The pearls have great luster and are an exceptional value at this price. I have been purchasing from Dahlia since October of 2009 and have never once been disappointed; their customer service is beyond outstanding! Buy with confidence I have several pieces from Dahlia, they ship fast and your jewelry arrives beautifully displayed in their signature boxes. Whether you purchase this set or something else, I highly recommend this seller.",5
555313,"Pefect fit, exactly what I was looking for; a hat with a short top as I don't have alot of hair and a much shorter bill which this has a perfect size bill not too long sticking out which I hate the look of, this was perfect and WOW WHAT BLING!!!!",5
493512,"i have very short brown hair, and usually don't have to wear a wig cap, but i do with this because its a bit see through. its my lightest color wig though and once i put on a cap its flawless. i got plenty of complements and its currently my favorite wig. you'll probably have to trim the bangs but all these problems are very minor and its very much worth it to buy this wig",4
356205,"Had to have this shipped to me twice, first one didn't work, second one had to change the batteries, luckily I had a small flash light that took the same kind of batteries, but still inconvenient, the batteries should be packaged separately if there is chance of them dying through the shipment process, other than that good quality",3
828851,I was looking forward to this shirt. The picture it is so cute. Sadly it is extremely small. A XXXL is a sm/med size. The material is stiff and just looks cheaply made. It's not going to fit so I can't review that. I received this at a discount for my honest unbiased review,1
710063,The dress is beautiful!  The quality of the fabric and workmanship is excellent. Delivery was very fast. Seller was great to work with answered my questions quickly.  It is best to send measurements and have it custom made to fit but we ordered a 6 and are very pleased with the fit.  We are very exited to order the for the rest of the bridesmaids! I highly recommend working with Custom Dress!,5
210324,"I was very disappointed when receiving this item.  I read all the wonderful reviews and was very excited to add this piece to my birthday/NYE outfit.  It fluffed up very nicely, but as soon as I fluffed it up, it began to shed on EVERYTHING!! I bought this to wear with a black dress, and I cannot wear it unless I want to carry a lint roller around with me all night!!! I am so upset as now I have no time to get another wrap to complete my perfect birthday outfit ",1
41618,"I purchased these glasses for biking and could not be happier; The wrap style covers my entire field of vision and the temples hold comfortably around my head without obstructing my clip-style headphones.

In short, these were the perfect glasses for me and cost a small fraction of what I would have expected to pay for such a product.

highly recommend!",5
368358,"Very cool LED shoes.... but like most ppl are saying, my nephew wore them for a few hours only after receiving them and the LED lights on one side of the shoes just died... won't come back on even after charging them. Must be a wire problem?...  but the description did said that it was for normal wear only, not running.",3
203705,I bought 4 of these caps. I wear them to work.  I sleep in them and I wear them out on a daily basis. I am about to order 2 more. I have shoulder length natural hair and it fits inside the slouch part of the hats. I've not seen any hair left inside of the cap.,5
414888,"We got this for my husband.  It's a little brighter yellow than the picture makes it look, but it's still a nice color (not fluorescent or anything).  Good quality, doesn't look like it's going to fall apart in one wash, and it's thick enough to not be see through either.",4
882502,I love the blouse it fit perfects in the body but I am not sure what happen at the manufacturer with the arms the arms on the blouse is too small and I am considered portion correctly. I think if you even think you have large arms you may want to rethink ordering. Oh and I ordered a XL the arm part of the blouse fit like a small. I gave the blouse to my sister she is pear shape and she love the blouse,3
399572,"Bought this to use at the beach last summer and it did serve its purpose, but I don't think it is going to last much longer. I pulled it out to use this spring and noticed it is tearing in a few places and it can not be fixed. It is cheap enough to buy for one season of use and the way it rolls up is a nice space saver when traveling.",3
158544,These work great but should not be worn with tighter pants.  On my more modern fit suit pants you could see the clasps mostly when I sat down but they were noticeable when standing.  On a slightly more classic style suit they work perfectly.  I rarely notice I am wearing them and they keep the shirt tucked in and it makes the shirt look slimmer but not bulging at the waist.  Great product.,4
875996,"I don't know what I was expecting for the price, but... the print is less tie-dye, more screen printed blue tiger stripes on thin plastic-like material and it runs large (I am average hight and slim- the small is a good length but about 1-2 sizes too big everywhere else). It's not entirely un-salvagable, though. Right now it makes a nice dressing gown and I will try dying it/taking it in. Still pretty good for the price!",3
166145,"I am 5' 3"" and 125lbs. Size small fit well and I liked the length which fell just above my ankles. However, the fabric was not as soft as I was hoping for. In fact, it was kind of stiff and did not have the stretch that I was looking for. Therefore, I did return these leggings.",2
141231,I really love this purse. Great style and I like the soft material. The one thing I really have an issue with is it smells awful. It's definitely the fake leather material but it smells like sewage and even after spraying perfume and leaving it open at night to air out it just won't go away. The bag is also pretty flimsy so it does tip over a lot. It needs a more solid formed bottom.,4
6646,I'm a diabetic that takes insulin shots in the thigh so I've been searching for a reasonable pair of pants that I can pull up fairly high for taking injections in public. Taking a shot in a standard pair of jeans is an absolute pain in the ass so these things make my life much easier. Plus they give my balls some room too so they're not constantly being squished. I returned and bought 3 more pairs. Normally I wear 34x34 so after reading the sizing comments I went with 36x34 and they fit perfectly!!!,5
688358,"The fabric is a very thin, see-through fabric that has no stretch at all. It comes from China and must be made for smaller framed women. I'm am an average 5'6"" American with full C breasts and there was no way it was going to fit me. It would be n",1
143641,"In comparison to what the image shows the quality was absolutely horrid. The paint was poorly done and the shaping of the latex was very rough and lazily done. All in all still a fun item to have, but it sure explains why the price went from 60$ to 14$.",1
19902,The material and color is nice. Unfortunately my baby takes it off after about 5 minutes if not immediately. When it stays longer and it is really warm then I see that she has sweat under the hat so it doesn't ventilate as well as it is described. also I'm not sure it would fit for an 18 months - on my 12 months seems that there is no more room and she doesn't have a big head..,3
764088,"I finally wore this shirt this week since the weather was chilly enough for long sleeves. I love the fit, the feel and the , material and want to get another color too! It's conservative, but not boxy or shapeless...the fabric has good stretch that makes the shirt hug my body without riding up. It actually looks like it does on the model! Versatile, comforable, good quality and great fit! I got it in charcoal/dark grey in a medium, which is my usual shirt size. 34D/27""/39  140 lbs 5'6""",5
339439,"We ordered these hats last year, but they are no longer the same product.  The hats are too small, and have the battery pack on the inside, against the sca.lp of the person wearing them.  They're terrible and uncomfortable, and the blinking is obnoxious.  Very cheap quality.  What happened to the hats from last year? My order brings me to this link, but these are not the same at all.",1
609395,"I wore this to a wedding and received a ton of compliments. It looked great. I steamed it to get rid of the wrinkles. The dress was super long though. Even after wearing six inch heels I had to cut off five inches. I just cut it right before the ceremony and didn't even bother hemming it, it didn't fray and you couldn't even notice. Worked perfectly!",5
831211,"I gave this to my little nephew who is 4 years old for his birthday,  He and his parents loved it as it fits a small wrist and it was accurate analog watch made of wood.  It looked really cute on him and he gets to learn to tell time.  Seems sturdy and came in a nice little box with a cushion.  Easy to wrap as a gift and nice looking to be appreciated.",4
850709,"The outfit is pretty long I'm 5'2 and had to get the skirt altered
The top is very big which also needs to be altered but.
How the skirt lays on the model in the pic it does not actually lay like that in person.
It's more puffy less flow.
It was nice a day on the beach.

The picture posted is just the bottom from the order because the top was way too big.",2
779841,"What a sweet tee! My granddaughter loved this shirt. It is really versatile and good quality material and construction. I was a little worried when I took it out of the package that it would be too snug, but when she put it on the spandex took care of that without it being tight.",5
500559,"This bracelet is an awesome purchase that I find my self wearing on a daily basis. It is an nice length as I had ordered a similar one before this that was too short and didn't amount to much on my arm. This one is beautifully made and the stones are the perfect size and color is soo captivating. For anyone who loves turquoise, you won't regret this purchase and will get compliments on it every time you wear it..I do!!",5
570540,I bought this to wear at my father's funeral. I got tons of compliments. And I didn't have to be self- conscious about my eyes that were swollen from crying & were naked with no mascara because the fascinator's vail covered them & took all the attention away from them.,5
183198,"This is a lovely, unusual piece that is perfect for the cat lover of all ages. I purchased it as a gift for a friend who went crazy when she got it.

The vendor is very special, too. Not only did she supply a very adequate chain with the piece, but also threw in a velvet version as an extra option at no additional cost. Terrific salesmanship.

If you want something different, classy and reasonably priced - look no further and buy one of these.",5
224528,Treat this shirt as a sports bra. It runs very small. According to the sizing chart I should be able to fit into a medium but I was skeptical and went with the large just to be sure and the large is still snug. It is very tight under the arms but I don't plan on wearing it more than once so it should be fine.,4
771289,Very comfy hat to keep me warm day or night. I have a medical condition that affects my core body temperature sometimes. You lose heat out of the top of your head so the light weight hat helps to keep my body core temperature warm. The hat runs a little big tho. I still love it anyways.,4
516101,"When looking for shirts,of course I look for a pattern or color that appeals to my taste,and where I intend to wear it.
Cinch is a high quality shirt,that can make anyone wearing it look a whole lot better,and beleive me there's a bunch of us out here that need all the help we can get.
When I wear a Cinch,I feel a whole lot better about myself,and in a lot of case's someone will comment nice shirt.(now even though they didn't say it. To me they are saying I am looking pretty good.)Thats good enough for me.",4
75954,"I was hoping this would allow me to wear my unbuttoned pre-pregnancy pants into my second trimester. I experience several issues which prevents me from using the BellaBand this way:
1. Although the band fits properly at my hips, it's too loose at the top. I ordered a size 2 and typically wear size 8-10 pants, so I don't think it's the wrong size.
2. It doesn't do enough to hide the fact that my pants are unbuttoned.
3. It rides up, so I'm constantly having to adjust the band.
4. It's just not very comfortable.",2
533887,"The product is well made, however it runs extremely small. It is especially tight in the thighs, shoulders, and knees. Using the sizing chart for the item, I ordered a size up from suggested. I should have ordered at least one size above that. It's part of a one-time costume, so we'll deal. If you are buying this for a Kaylee Frye costume, definitely order a couple sizes up. The material does not stretch at all.",3
465788,2 stars because I like the socks but they didn't send me THESE socks when I ordered them.  They were for a friend that loves them (this would have been the second pair).  I think they're a little pricey for the quality - but she likes them so I went for them again.,2
434119,"These had SO much room in the crotch I was astonished. I would have had to pull them up to my ribs to keep them from being baggy.  Also, they are so thin, I would not have felt comfortable wearing them in public.  They felt like the thickness of pantyhose.",2
657666,"I love this dress! I was a little nervous but I'm so happy I made this purchase! Its a lovely weight and color. The beading is an amazing quality too! My only gripe was that it was SUPER long, but I won't take off points for that, I didn't order a cutom or anything. Overall, amazing product!",5
383409,It fit good which I was worried about. Only issue I could see coming up would be it won't stick for many uses. The sides were coming unstuck and I only wore it for 2 minutes but I still am pleased and think it'll work nicely for strapless dresses. Also make sure you do not have any lotion or water or anything on your skin or it will make it not stick very well.,4
693482,"This jacket is nice quality, but it is more a shawl that sits on your shoulders and you put your arms thru the armholes and the rest just sits on your shoulders.  I read the reviews before making purchase and ordered  XXL (I normally wear a 14) and it will be good for covering my shoulders and then hanging up when I get there.",4

434184,I bought this for a belt to wear with a suit.  I ordered it to come overnight and UPS messed up delivering it so I had to go to Macy's at the last minute and ended up keeping that one for a couple dollars more.  I know it is an inexpensive belt but there are others in this range that look a little better.  I returned it and kept the one from Macy's.,3
75033,"I'm only 12 weeks along (carrying twins) and already having to wear a band. I bought the biggest one, and I'm wishing they came even bigger than this so I could wear one later on in the pregnancy instead of having to buy more pants. Can you make a size 5 and 6 for those of us with more than one little bun? :)",4
46381,"i ordered the the glasses online which i was very hesitant to do. i always try them of first because you never know how they are really going to look. this is the first time ive ordered glasses online. i am so happy that i did. they are smaller than i thought they were, which i am pleased aobut. i took them to my eye dr and i can add my invisible bifiocals which i was concerned aobut. i love the look of them. i am very happy with my purchase, and i loved the price.",5
462381,"Very cute, but I like my pj's too be roomy and comfortable. I'm a large and bought a 2x, just in case of shrinkage after washing. I couldn't even pull them all the way up. I gave them to my daughter that wear a size 9, and they fit her perfectly.",2
493884,"These have the best grip on the Barre class floor mat of all the 'sticky socks' I've tried. They also grip the wood floor between the mats better than the others. The Barre teacher asked me where I got them ( Amazon, of course) and said they were super-cute. These socks are much cooler on my feet than the neoprene Mary-janes I was wearing before.",5

Maybe I was lucky, my package arrived today (expected date June 2). I'm pretty happy and they're just what I expected: tongue rings.",4
408732,"I bought this necklace thinking it would blend in but still be lovely.  When I got it, Journey style necklaces were becoming very popular and I was so happy that no one else had this one, so I got tons of compliments.  The pendant itself looks very clean and perfect, so I recommend this to anyone looking for an elegant, fairly priced piece of jewelry.",5
872923,"Overall these are pretty nice, they are a bit thicker than I have had in the past which is nice. Not for racing but I am going to use them as a rash guard in the ocean and they should be perfect.  Slightly on the large side by with the waistband they should be fine.",4
850755,"Good basic broad leather belt. It's 1.5"" wide so it's a good width. My waist is 27"" so I appreciate being able to get it in XS. My only fault Is that the finish of the underside is a little rough and can drag on your pants material. Overall a good buy.",4
173708,"The Good: This bra is attractive, and cheap!  The fabric is pretty nice.  It looks great on.  I normally wear a 34-36B.

The Bad: The size 36 fits like a 32-34 when on the largest set of hooks. It did come with an extended, so that helped.

The Ugly: The shoulder straps. Even adjusted to the longest length, they cut into my shoulders badly. I had another set of straps I could use, so this is not a total waste, but be aware the straps are ULTRA short.",3
369714,I bought these for our Disney Cruise to hold our Key to the World card.  They worked great! I keep a small travel size bottle of Advil and lactaid in my pouch so we always had some with us. My daughters used the lanyard for holding all their pins. If you have a smaller/ older smart phone it can fit in the case easily.  My daughter has a thin case on her iPhone 6 and could squeeze it in the pouch.,4
270880,"I have gotten two jeans from the past from this brand and the two fit perfectly! But when I ordered the white ripped one's in size 5, I couldn't even fit my leg into the jeans. The jeans look like how they looked in the picture but the size was way off! Will be sending back",2
634268,"My biggest disappointment is the color. The mint isn't mint at all, it's baby blue. This top is very pretty and I've gotten a lot of compliments on it, especially with a matching tank top underneath.

I felt the fit was a bit too large.
However there is no stretch to the material and it's very fragile so you have to order a size or two up to avoid tearing it while putting it on or taking it off.",3
496804,"Love these, may have done ok w a small as I'm a 6.5, but got a Medium. Need them as inside-house shoes overseas where you leave your street shoes outside, so small pouch fits perfectly inside purse so I can whip them out instantly. This order comes from Australia, that wasn't clear to me so got charged a foreign transaction fee so USA people, be aware of that but they arrived super fast!",5
46874,"The size fits well and the mitts feel secure. I do wonder if the smaller size would have worked better for me, but I don't have particularly small features. Otherwise, the product keeps my ears well insulated and safe from the wind. No more achey inner ear from the cold gusts.",4
437378,"Thinner then I thought it was going to be - however, the size works.

I wear this ring daily and haven't had any problems. Spins just as good as it did the day I got it. And since the design is so subtle, you can wear it with pretty much anything. Love it.",5
471073,"I LOVE this hat. True, as some reviewers have said, the poms don't hang down as low as you might like, but you have to be sure you have it on the right way. The slit goes in back. Then the poms hang down lower. This is my happy hat.",5
763596,"Sizing on the jacket is a little weird. Xl runs a little large and the large runs a little small. If you're looking for that superhero tight like fit I would suggest the smaller size. I'm also 6'4"" so I might be a unique problem.
Seller was very responsive and did awesome with shipping.",5
597293,"I loved the print, so I got it for summer under a lab coat. The loose fit across the bust was perfect..but the arm holes are cut so that your boob and the side of your bra shows...not a problem under a lab coat or a blazer/sweater etc.  If I ordered it smaller, the buttons would pull across the bust.  Nice colors for summer however.",3
278230,I love love love love love this one size fits all dress! I am 5'8. The dress is way longer than shown in pic which I actually prefer as it makes it a bit more dressy. Material is stretchy so if you gain weight in sure it will still fit and the actual length is about mid- calf.,5
357971,"I bought this ring from Amazon for myself because I lost my original wedding band, (my wife was not happy about that obviously).  After seeing the ring on my finger, she liked it so much, she asked me to buy the same one for her.  Now we have matching wedding bands that look much better than the originals.  The workmanship is beautiful, and the  Tungsten Carbide is nearly scratchproof.  I am amazed that a ring of this quality is offered at such a low price.  It looks expensive and feels great on your finger.",5
546638,"I gave these to my daughter as an Xmas gift. She loved them and wore them that day. The reason for the 4 star rating is that the coloring on the beads (dark wood w turquoise) did not seem the same as the website. Looked more brown with highlights on the web, but were more solid colored in person.  Still a great gift.",4
680810,"This dress is well made and will be super cute with some tights or leggings. The bow that is on the deer's ear is detachable. In fact, it was detached when it arrived in our package, so you may want to make sure you locate it when opening yours. I'd definitely recommend this dress to others. We love it! =)",5
117129,The SMELL???!!!!  I had to throw them away because the smell wouldn't wash out.  It's a chemical smell that has come with several items I've purchased from Amazon that apparently come from China.  I wish I could weed those factories out when I search for items I'm looking for.,1
707868,"I wear this when I am running in close weather. As it is not made explicitly for this, it does restrict one's vision somewhat. However, it does a great job of keeping my face warm and attracting smiles of people passing by.

It is also a great last-minute Halloween mask.

There is a small odor and a bit of scratchiness, both of which are resolved by a run in the washing machine.",4
80037,The socks are really cute and the fact that they come in a dozen is also really helpful because we lose socks all the time. The vendor is great! They sent me the wrong package and immediatly fixed the situation without costing me time or additional money. They responded very quickly and fixed the situation for me. great customer service and great product!!,5
472184,"True to description, it is crushable wool and quality checked by our 18mth old who had destroyed a previous purchase (not the same hat). It holds it's shape nicely even after being 'baby-handled'. It has garnered many compliments. The colored ban adds a nice hint of color without being flamboyant. It is felt and requires lint removal periodically as you might expect.",5
386436,"Overall, this bra looks well made and I love the design of the straps on the back. It also has removable bra pads. I am a true Medium size so I ordered this bra in a Medium and it was too small, so I am returning it for a Large. I would recommend ordering one size up as this bra runs small.",5
322937,"I bought these for my 3 yr. old grandson. The reason I didn't give a 5-star rating on these is because I ordered according to his clothing size which is a 4T. They do run somewhat small.  Although he can wear them for a long period of time now, I can't say that the same will be true in a month or so.  They are very cushy slippers!",4
779151,"The dress is just amazing!!!The fabric is perfect and the way it is made is awesome. I ordered this dress for my bridesmaids, we ordered first one to see if we would like, we are just now in love with it, we are ordering the others. We made sure that the measurements were taken and we compare  it to the measurement table in the different pictures of the dress.",5
642535,"This charm is a beautiful addition to my Pandora bracelet. It is very high quality and the stones are gorgeous. Definitely a stunner! It does flip upside down but really isn't an issue.

Tried to wear them out, friend pointed out some huge tears in the seaming, like complete rips.  Very cheaply made.  I never give product reviews unless something is really good, ive never given out a bad review before though.  these were just a huge disappointment",1

I loved the piercing. I kept it in for 2 days or so and took it out on the 3rd day. I wasn't sure if it was getting infected or not. It started to turn red around the balls. I'm going to wait to get it done by a professional.",4

I work with boxes all day long and it has good grip I also use a touch screen computer and these are really easy to use with it so I don't have to take them off constantly. they are a little more slippery with plastic covering then other gloves I have used but over all the best ones I've tried so far. they fit a tiny bit smaller then I was expecting but not enough to be a big deal at all.,4

The dress did not fit my bust 36 D and would not touch my shoes.",2

Paired with a bow tie and he was getting cat calls as ""Little GQ!"" in downtown. Such a perfect finish to his outfit. Nice quality, and simple to adjust. Cross plate is not genuine leather, but I was not really expecting it to be. Very nice none the less. I am sure these will still fit him for a little while.",5
516604,"Great plastic-bottomed spikes for track and field. The weight of the shoes corresponds properly to a good quality middle distance shoe, nice and light and suitable for sprinting due to the size of the plastic region on the bottom of the shoe. Also aesthetically pleasing. Only minor issue is the durability, the green stripes along the side began to peel off after a few meets, but this does not interfere with the running and so it does not bother me too much..",4

I bought it in the summertime, and I love it. Also, I bought size 18 (I normally wear a size 16-18 in American sizes) and it fits nicely. I think if my breasts were bigger, though, it might be too snug in that area. So, if you're bigger than a D, be aware of that.",5
212147,"Shipping was prompt, but the dress is a disappointment. While seemingly well constructed,  the fabric is cheap and thin to the point of being ridiculous. I got the eggplant color and the fabric is sheer enough to be more like opaque hosiery.  The skirt is nowhere near as full as it shows in the pictures, so be aware of that as well. I don't give it one star because the color and fit were as advertised, but that's about it.  I'll keep it as lounge wear around the home, but doubt I'll wear in public.",2

Overall, I love the piece and had a great experience with the company.",5

It came in the correct size and came about 2 weeks earlier than scheduled! Installing it took about 10 mins. Much more comfortable than the original rubber band on the LG g watch. Great value. Extremely comfortable for me and my wrist is pretty big. Just make sure you put it on the right way,5

As an Amazon Prime member, I was very surprised that I must PAY to return the shorts. Im accustomed to free returns.",1

The cars are hazy around the edges, which I guess you can tell when you look very closely at the pictures on the site. Just wish they were in focus more and a little brighter in color. The shirt is good quality. Glad it shrunk when I dried it. I bought one size up for my two year old, glad I did.",4

The Nylon blend is soft, comfortable, squat-proof and holds up well over multiple washes (Do not machine dry these). They are my favorite style of leggings for the gym. The length is perfect for me. They are cropped but not overly so they do not make my legs look shorter. I'm 5'5, 135lbs, ""pear-shaped"" meaning I carry my weight on my lower body and I wear a Small in these.",4
264096,"This skirt is ok but not exactly what I expected. I'm 5'9"" and 175 lbs with wide hips so got size large. The fit is ok - not exactly too small but not flattering. Maybe it's the color - mint green. A darker color might be more flattering. Also there's a seam down the back (in addition to seams on both sides), which makes it less flowy. Overall I'm not too happy with this skirt and still deciding whether it's worth returning it.",3
116639,This was delivered very quickly.  The sweater is SO soft.  I love wearing it.  The sleeves are a bit shorter than in the pic and length is a little shorter too.  I get compliments on the sweater all the time.  Would definitely buy from them again.,4
763639,It works! For a 34E the cups are a tad small and to get this to work the band on the bottom i had to tie-in a knot instead of using the clasp. Other than that the fabric it good quality and works for me. My suggestion is order a cup size up.,4
114320,"This is seriously the cutest costume! We took our 14 month old to boo at the zoo, and she was the only one of hundreds of little girls wearing this.  It was sooo much cuter and more original than all the Elsas, Annas, and mini mouse costumes combined . It was cold outside, but I was easily able to layer clothes underneath. Love it!",5
352020,"This thing is awesome! I have about 7 cards in it and it's super slim. I got it because I didn't want my old thick wallet affecting my hip in my back pocket.

It fits without any pulling when I sit down in the car when it's fully zipped.  There is alot of extra room if I need to wear a fleece jacket underneath. It's not as warm as my old jacket though and I don't like the crinkly plastic sound.",4

Size M fits perfectly fine. I do not understand all the ""order 2x size up of what you'll normally wear"" reviews. I love these joggers so much that I ended up ordering all 3 available colors.",5
621580,Too small. Once again the overseas dress manufacturers need to buy a clue when it comes to fitting a curvy plus size 16 American woman. I couldn't fit a XXL. Too bad because it was a pretty dress. Ladies!...please consider this purchase it will cost $17.95+$14.95 for tracking. You'd be taking a risk the return is more than the dress.,3
386324,"The material is a little thinner than I thought utt would be but overall a cute shirt.  I typically wear a L (12/14) so ordered the XXL. Thankfully, utt spandex or it may have been a little too small. Beautiful pattern.  I'm 5'9"" and length is to my knee.  Overall worth the add to my closet.",3
215760,The material is so cheap that washing it causes water spots. I have not been able to wear it because it arrived with a  water spot. When I washed it to get rid of the spot it created even more spots! There is no label on the dress to tell you what material it's made of. And it's a lot shorter than it looks in the pic. I REGRET THIS PURCHASE.,1
448450,I own this bag in white (crazy about it) and gave a blue one to my best friend. She absolutely adores it. It's a wonderful size; big without being huge. And the color is exactly as depicted on the website. Nice detailing and feels like real leather. No vegan leather smell at all. (I've had issues with this on other products.) I highly recommend this couture looking bag to anyone. Very tasteful.,5
572047,"I have long hands and have a hard time finding gloves that fit. I got a pair of XL and they fit well, to my surprise. Most XL gloves are too wide for my palm and not long enough for my fingers but these are the closest I've gotten to custom fit. I plan to order more and a few for gifts this holiday season. I have great sensitivity in them, I was able to pick up coins from the floor without any difficulty. They feel great on my hands also.",5
442914,"Really cool watch. Too bad I can't wear it. It's listed as unisex but it's clearly made for a man.  I bought it for me... I'm a woman. The band is giant and the watch face is as wide as my wrist.  Yes, the band can be sized down,..  but it's just way too masculine for me.  Totally irritating since it seems like a really cool watch... I gave it to my husband even though he doesn't wear watches. It was a waste of money. :/",2

618197,"It honestly should be less expensive. It's not great quality. Really cheaply made. However, I do like it. I love the style and length. I just wish I were made with better material to make a better product. Or at least the price lowered. It really isn't worth $9 plus tax.",3
439171,So this jacket is a little small in the sleeves but besides that it fits well. What I was surprised was the fabric that it was made out of. I was expecting standart suit jacket material but its actually a textured fabric. It looks good! The only complaint that I have is that the shoulder pads are a little funny.,3
614842,"After searching through countless sketchy looking sellers, I put my faith in this seller.  Boy am i glad I did! I was delighted for it was delivered a day earlier than expected! I was prepared for a ok looking bag but its precisely what the picture looks like!  It's beautiful.  I will definitely be ordering from you guys again. Everything is stitched tight and cleanly. Actual buckles not magnets. Perfect.  I HIGHLY  recommend.",5
461980,"When I bought the dress I already knew it would be big but to my surprise it still fit me amazingly well. The only complain I have (that is easily fixed) is that the length of the dress it a tad bit too long, nothing that my sowing machine can't fix though. Overall great purchase for the price. You get what you paid for.",4
198909,These shoes looked great once we were finally able to get them on my son's feet. The back of the shoe folds down very easily when you are trying to put the shoe on. It seemed you almost needed a shoe horn. This is not great when trying to put shoes on a four-year-old. My son would get really upset because we struggled so much. He does not really wear them often because I do not want to deal with putting them on.,3
75541,"I had ordered size one initially because I am petite and at 10 weeks, but that turned out way too small. So I exchanged one for size two, which fits much better and is very comfortable. I am happy with the material and the fit once I found the right size.",4
676149,"These fit great for me.  I am 5'. I don't thinks they would fit as well on someone taller.  They just fit just right for myself. I like them a lot, but seem proportioned for someone who is shorter (most things I try to order are made too long).",5
784873,"This lighted jewelry box made the necklace I gave a a gift even more special. The way it lit up the item made it sparkle and the recipient also lit up with amazement. The quality was fine and it displayed the item well. My only complaint is that the price was very expensive in my opinion. With a lower price, I would give it 5 stars!!!",3
698102,"It's not overwhelmingly big, but more than a day bag and definitely suitable for smaller stature (5'4 and under). Holds my 13"" laptop, everyday Kipling purse, toiletries, sweater(s), ipad, several gifts, packed lunch. Only the one main zippered pocket on the outside.  It's appears to be durable, wipe-able material, semi-softsided and has a harder bottom w/4 tiny peg feet.  I've been able to keep it sitting upright with laptop in it, but needs contents balanced. Does have a luggage sleeve on back.",5
438203,"The jeans themselves are ok, however, I should of heeded the warning of another reviewer. They are good quality jeans but they were waaay to small in the waist. I would say they are at least a whole size may two sizes to small... little disappointing. Regardless, I am going to keep them in hopes I will fit into them sometime one day soon..",3
450976,"-->Purchased for my wife as an anniversary gift. It arrived on time and looked like the picture. However, after she wore it to dinner and took it off, the pearl popped off in her hand. It did not appear to be mounted properly at all. It was returned within the week.",1

They are nip covers, they do what they are supposed to. They stay on, feel comfortable and you cannot see them thru clothing (they are my skin color too). Didn't give 5 stars b/c thought they were a bit expensive. Careful to not have oils/lotions when around the nipple or that could be a slight prob.",4
682048,Fit is big and it's a knock off product. The descendants are my daughters favorite that the only reason I didn't send it back. It's a screen print put  on a fruit of the loom shirt and then a descendants tag was sewn in it. Shouldn't even be legal to do that.,3
615882,"I was pretty exicted to get this dress but once it arrived i noticed how thin the material was. It was completely see through. I couldn't even wear a bra underneath due to the fact that it was easily visible. The white bands were a weird creme color, too. Completely dissatisfied.",1

525389,I really like the look of these captives they seem to be very nice quality. However the dimples in the balls for the ring to set in are quite shallow and small making these extremely difficult to put in. Putting them in my ears was in fact impossible and for the time being I have had to give up on getting them.,4
266927,"Beautiful design that accents my nipples quite nicely. I needed to adjust one so that it would stay on, it adjusted fine without difficulty or damage to the ring. Place the opening facing down to help them stay on.  I was worried about losing it while dancing at the club with no bra on, but they stayed on just fine and help keep my nipples looking perky.",5
374700,"I ordered based on the given size guidelines and the fit was perfect. I was able to do the more complex knots and didn't have the problem others did with lack of length. However, I found the leather softens a bit with use, making some of the knots more difficult to complete because they require a study leather to in and out of the loop multiple times. But I would purchase again and would recommend it to others.",5

Cons:  stiff leather, logo fell off

217134,"Great hat for blocking sun, fishing, and the like.  I'd bought a $75 Orvis hat (the Lochsa) a while back.  It's synthetic straw, and therefore crush-proof.  However, I like this hat better, I think.  The dark underbrim  really cuts down on the glare while fishing, something the Lochsa lacks.  The price is so low, you really can't go wrong.  Too bad I didn't discover it earlier.",5
551899,"The dress will not cover my... ""girls"" I guess MAYBE if I get some double sided tape. I guess with how it looks I was taking the chance. The beads are just are too heavy... even with double sided tape I would be a little scared. This dress may only be good for taking pictures.",3
798161,The necklace was delivered early and what a nice surprise to find in wrapped in a cute little pink box with a silver bow.  It even came with a hand-written note from the seller.  Nice touch.  The necklace is very light and comfortable to wear. It's really stylish.  It has a lobster claw clasp which makes it easy to take on and off.  I love it.,5
797106,"I purchased these shoes for my disabled son - the velcro closing is a must. However, the sizing is absolutely not in sync with other velcro-closing shoes I've purchased in the past, as these are definitely too snug. He can still wear them, but only with the thinnest socks and I'm hoping they'll stretch a little with wear.",2
467926,"LOVE this. Shipped fast, price was a steal, and as it turns out the material is great! I'm a size small in everything US, but based on the front/chest measurements I went with the large. So happy I did. It's thick and I had no problem with the pockets. REALLY a steal for the price! So surprised!",5
200969,"The costume is made of a cheap and clingy material, not to mention see through with the top. The skirt I can use with a sweater or something, but it's altogether a little too snug for my liking (I got the largest size and I am 5'3"" and around 130 pounds). It fits, but I wouldn't wear it in public without a big cardigan or not wear the top at all since its see through :(",2
218348,"Bought my wife the large as she's a size 6-7 jeans and this was still way too small (tag said large so right size was shipped, just very small)  She is 5'4"", 140 lbs, 36c.  Top fit nice, skirt was WAY to small for an adult woman to wear.",1
410975,I'm so happy to finally have found earrings that my daughter can wear without any allergy issues.  She picked these out and loves them.  She doesn't take them out too often so I can see that they could bend out of shape if handled to much. Overall very happy with them.,4
640783,This dress arrived on time and is a beautiful dress.  I carefully reviewed the sizing chart and ordered the correct size however it was way too big.  There was no sizing information on the dress.  The sizing tag that was attached was blank.  I am not sure whether to order another size.,3
791274,"I'm a women's size 16 and the XL fits perfectly. It's plenty long enough to wear with leggings and I'm tall. I will not put it in the dryer because I want to keep the length. Well-made; the styling is not as nice as some but the practicality is great.  Loose sleeves with no cuffs, which I like. WARNING: This sweatshirt is very fluffy on the inside and really, really warm - almost as warm as a wool sweater.",4
669740,"Not even remotely the size that was described.  WAY TOO SMALL.  Measured it and it fell almost 3 inches inches short of the description in every dimension.  Extremely disappointed.  Also, the material is FAR cheaper than I expected, and wasn't even a consistent shade of black, it was splotchy!  Thankfully, Amazon is still awesome and they helped me return and exchange for a different item in time to still give a lovely birthday present!",1
414842,"I purchased one of these for my daughter about 5 years ago and one for myself about a year ago and both of them have kept all the stones intact and look sparkly despite constant wear. Occasionally I polish mine with a cloth and scrub it up with a toothbrush, dish soap and water and it looks like new. Quality workmanship, perfect gift for a birthday milestone!",5

63692,"The package says that items may not be as pictured, and the boots were very different...made out of velour instead of the fabric pictured, and the white stripes on the boots had big red stains on them.  And they don't cover your entire shoes, just the tops..no heel cover.  The reviews I read here said the sizes ran large and to get one size smaller than you usually would, but I am a size 8 and the small was too small, so I should have gone with the medium. The skirt is much fuller than pictured, also.",2
75464,"I followed the size chart and so far fitting great.  At 23 weeks and still wearing my normal dress pants unhooked with the belly band to hold them up/closed.  From my research it's worth the money to buy the good ones as they wear and work much better.  Glad I spent the moolah, as I'm getting tons of use.  Have white & black.  They wash perfectly and I air dry them.",5
12919,"I got these insoles on the recommendation of my podiatrist to help my plantar fasciitis. She suggested that these were more affordable than custom orthotics and I might want to try them before ordering the custom ones. I'm glad I did. I have them in all my shoes now, and have recommended them to other family members. They fit my wide feet well.",5
713198,"I wear a 36 bra and purchased the large. The material is nice enough, but the bra rolls at the band under the breasts, which is annoying.  It is good that the pad inserts are removable as they seem to run small.  I found it comfortable and non-binding, but would not purchase again because of the band.",3
62483,The Product was nothing like described or as pictured. Was very cheaply made had braids and cheap plastic jewels all over which it did not have in picture and which I did not want. The color was also a bright red and the felt was cheap and beaded were falling off the hatleavingbthe hit glue marks. On top of that it shipped much later than promised. This was a Christmas gift and arrived to late to do anything about it before Christmas.,1
827156,"Excellent, comfortable belt. I've had two of them for a few weeks now, and they flare holding up very well thus far. I use them at work and everywhere else; they look nice with khakis, jeans, and shorts. I am very pleased with them. A word of caution though; the tiger's eye belt is not the same color as shown in the picture. It is actually more of a chocolate brown belt with a darker gray buckle. I ordered it because I knew from the grip6 website what the color actually was.",5
51143,"I'm not sure if I ordered the wrong size or was putting this on improperly but I couldn't get this to stay in one place.  It either auld up or down my tummy.  I asked for a binder after I had the baby and had a flat stomach 3 weeks after having my 3rd child.  Just ask for a binder when you're in the hospital, it fits better and your insurance pays for it!",3
119462,It could have just been this one in particular but right when I tried to put it on it broke! I fixed it my closing a link that broke and then the elastic feel apart.... It is made poorly or maybe I just have a big head? Lol well you get what you pay for. The detail is very pretty and it came in on time),3
805639,"My grandson loved it!  The sleeves were too long, but they were easy to roll up.  It was long enough to reach his rain boots.  While he was not wearing a jacket when we used it, it was large for one to fit.  Even so, he did not think it was too large.  I think he will be able to use it for some time.  He loved the look of it.",5
3167,The original wallet insert just plain wore out. My wallet has formed fitted itself to my posterior so I didn't want to go through the agony of breaking in a totally new one. All I needed was some new inserts. These are actually a tad wider than the originals so some items that were a snug fit just slip in easily. I like them.,5
88492,"This costume was listed at a really great price, which is what prompted my order. Although the costume is a little chinzy, it looked great in pictures and was a decent purchase overall. The gloves and ears fit great but I did feel the costume ran a little large...I am normally a size small in tops and with the stretch elastic back on the dress, it was loose on me in the waist area.",4
463078,I read the comments and knew this top would be plus sized before I ordered it. I'm a size 2x with a large chest and this fits great. I get compliments every single time I wear it. It will not fit off-the-shoulder as the pic shows but it is about the same length. I definitely wear a cami under it since it is a sheer fabric. I've ordered several items from Allegra K and am pretty satisfied with all of them - but I have definitely learned to use the measurements they offer in every item description.,5
650720,WAAAAAY too small.  I am a size 6 and bought a medium which should fit a size 8-10 and I couldn't get the skirt on.  My sister is smaller than I am and couldn't wear it either.  The only reason I gave 2 stars is that the company offered a refund without me having to return the item.,2
831575,"Love this wallet phone case. Very sturdy. Just hoping the magnet holds good after I put more things in it. Well made.

270180,"I love this dress but it is short and I am only 5'2, so I actually wore shorts underneath because I felt like if I were to bend down to get something I would expose everything. I would recommend buying it though because the material and quality is really good and even better that it was only 12$.",5
624557,"I purchased this shorty PJ set for my elderly mom. I could not find this style locally. the set is nicely made. the fabric is soft and comfortable. Not overly thin, a nice medium weight.

We ordered the large. I feel the top runs larger than the bottoms. The scoop neck is very wide. My mother has slim shoulders.

Overall , we are happy. If I were to order again I would go down a size.",4
314850,"This ring is a little too big on top, but the gold accents and the red cross really make it stand out among other stainless steel rings.
It's good that the top is hollow otherwise the ring would be too heavy. If you wanna get a feel for its' weight, grab three quarters and a nickle. Both ring and coins weigh 0.8 ounces or 22 grams. Seller put up excellent pics of the ring, by the way. It looks just like in the pictures. Shipping time and packaging were both excellent.",4
159535,"I'm always skeptical when buying clothing and accessories from the internet because colors are sometimes not quite right or the texture is bad. I took a chance with this scarf and I'm glad I did. The colors are just like the picture and the fabric is soft. This is not the highest quality fabric but it's a good thing because it's thin and breezy. It's also big enough to wrap around your head or use as a beach cover up so it's great for traveling. Overall, very happy with this.",5
160915,"LOVE IT. I'm short. Barely five ft, but that's to be expected since I'm still on middle school. The size adjustment thing on the bag is awesome. I think it'll work even if ur below or above my height. I like the size but from person to person opinions on that vary. The only complaint is the material. That's to be expected though because its lower in price than others. Overall, it's not perfect, but it's good enuff",4
521015,I bought these for my husband and he loves them. They are of good quality and soft to the touch. I freaked the first time he did laundry because he just threw them in and washed them in hot water. I was worried they would shrink. Nope! They are still true to size. My husband wears a 10.5.,5

278338,"It's actually really nice. It looks just like the picture and it has a lot of compartments which is nice. The only thing I will say though is that it was bigger than I expected so it can't fit in my small, over-the-shoulder purse but I have a larger purse and a smaller wallet so I don't really have a problem. Overall, a nice purchase.",5
137612,"it was a very cheap deal and I wasn't sure if I really was going to like, but if I didn't there wouldn't be that much regret.  But guess what?  I really like it, they are not big scarfs but they will be nice for the summer time.",4

It is her favorite night gown!  I will buy another one for her. It shrunk a little bit with her first wash, but it was plenty big so it still fit her well.",5
39817,"I *love* these boots and am now on my 3rd pair. They fit my rather thin calves perfectly (most boots are too wide), but are a bit stretchy to fit larger calves too. The heel and platforms heights are perfect. They are a little tight around the toes when I first put them on, but after wearing them around for a while I don't notice it much. I love wearing these with jeans and tank tops or a cute short dress.",5
583155,I shop online a lot but was a little hesitant about the bathing suit! I must say it fits perfect and very comfortable! I usually buy 18-20 so I got this suit in a 2x! The blue color I chose really pops off of my skin tone!  Let me not forget the unbeatable price! I'm all ready for the beach!!!!!,5

Aside from that, it's a green clown wig.",3
761462,I didn't get what I ordered at all! After a huge mess with the carrier I had to place my order twice and get reimbursed for the first one.  Because it was such a hassle to get anything at all I'm going to live with it but it's not what I wanted. I received some very ugly cheap looking Aztec design rather than the floral fans I ordered.,1

74573,"At first I was so excited to find tights in a larger size, and was so pleased when I first tried them on.
I wore them with my Halloween costume, and before the kids even got to our door for treats, the tights were already bagging around the ankles.  I usually have more of a problem with tights rolling down my belly, which yes is full of jiggle, and these didn't!  But the bagginess was pretty serious.  I actually thought of wearing them today, just a random day for fun - but then remembered the ankles.  Sad.",3
878603,"The dress is nice, but, it is hard to put on and take off - it does not have a zipper.  You get in and out of the dress, via the lace up in the back.  In addition, the dress runs very small.  I had to buy the dress 3 sizes up, .  This gave me the perfect fit.",3

Wonderful dress for any occasion.,5

It came quite longer than I expected (or maybe I just have a really small neck) so I had to take it apart, trim it, and adjust it.

It's actually very cute, but I can't imagine wearing it without a belt or tie around the waist. I might just wear it with leggings to bum around the house. Unlike everyone else, I love the collar.",3
396723,My daughter absolutely loves them. Appears to be good quality. She's only had a chance to wear them in the rain once but loves to wear them around the house. They run a little big but ok with that since rainy season is almost over. She'll have them for the Fall.,4
626819,Love the item. More space then what I thought it would have. PERFECT for the type of girl who doesn't want a full sized handbag. All I ever carry is my phone.. keys.. money and cards this is perfect fit for all of it and other small items like comb and female products. Already have friends drooling over it and asking where I got it and wanting one.,5
879721,"Ordered a large, but should have gotten a medium.  I will need to wear another cami/tank under this because the arm openings are much too big for me.  Not a deal breaker, but would rather not have to layer my summer clothes.  For reference I am 5'6"", average build, aprox 140 lb.  Hope that helps future buyers.",4

There's even room in there for dad's glove and a bottle of water too. I didn't think it would hold that much stuff, but it's quite roomy. He even keeps a sweatshirt in there for those cold practice days. These are quite sturdy, and has a separate pocket for bats, nice feature.",5
191702,"When I saw these, I knew they would be perfect for my wedding since my fiance is a bit of a sunglasses freak and we are having an outdoor wedding.
The quality of these sunglasses is very good. They are sturdy; they don't feel flimsy or cheap. Looking through them is rather interesting as they are plastic lenses with the stickers over top. The stickers are full of uniform holes which make it possible to see pretty clearly and they will do a good job of blocking the sun. I am overall really happy with my purchase.",5
246609,I'm very disappointed in this top I order an 2x and the dang shirt so small I can't even get it on and then I don really 2x I wear xl but I get 1x/2x to have room for my little stomach I have but this top is cute but don't fit ugh then I order a red skirt and the leopard wedges to go with ugh I'm pissed thought I was going to be fine but not gotta find another top something like it,1
792472,"Very nice pants, they are super comfortable and I absolutely love the design, I got the black cats. They are made out of great quality material that is extremely comfortable. They are great to work out in or just lay around, I couldn't be happier with this purchase. Wonderful product and arrived much sooner then expected! I did receive this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.",5

I ordered this item on 7/25/15 and I had it as promised - from the seller.
Item was packed very secure and it is a beautiful watch I am very happy with it and the care the seller took in making sure the item got to me safely.  I am very pleased to recommend this item.
I am very excited because I also ordered the black one as well - I can not wait for it to get here!!!

874566,I ordered this shirt in pink and loved it so much I ordered one in turquoise. As I age my waist line is rapidly diminishing. This does not hug too tightly in that area but the shirt still has shape. It washes up nicely and I haven't noticed any fading. I will order from this company again.,5
843743,"but not so small that I can't still wear it. I suggest you buy 2 sizes up. The material is very thin and see through so they are great for hot summer days. they hang just low enough that they make what ever you have on look nice. I usually wear a Medium, I  am 5'2"" 133 lbs. 36B. I think you get your moneys worth.",4

880388,"They are pretty post earrings. But the backs don't fit! One was too big & the other was too small. I felt like Goldilocks.... That's why I gave it only 2 stars. Backs are very important. Was going to send them back , but I make simple jewelry for fun & had backs that fit (many craft stores supply them in their ""jewelry findings"" department, so I didn't.",2
443915,"These briefs were advertised as being antimicrobial as well as 100% cotton well when they arrived they were 100% cotton but there was no mention of the antimicrobial factor involved. I washed  them, (I bought the xlarge) because the reviews that said that they ran small. Upon washing, they shrink down to nothing.
My fault for trusting Amazon.",1
553325,"Hoodie was delivered on time, but was alot smaller than expected and we ordered the large. Our daughter in law wasn't able to put her arms in the sleeves and she of average size. We are disappointed because it doesn't come in a larger size and this was a christmas present, now we have to pay shipping to return it and then purchase something else.",2
537306,"The rubies are nice, the setting looks very cheap and flimsy in person - granted it is cheap in price but the picture makes it look much nicer than it actually is. The 4 prongs that you see holding the ruby look small and stylish in the picture but are actually quite large in real life.",3
655731,"I bought my hulk-obsessed boyfriend this for his birthday and he absolutely loves it! He wears a 3X and always needs a tall because he has such a long torso, and this shirt fit PERFECTLY! It's also super soft and didn't shrink when I washed/dried it on hot. This was his favorite present! I would definitely recommend this shirt!",5
506459,My daughter Absolutely loves this dress!! Beautiful detail and well made! I read that the dress ran a little big and my daughter was right in between the 4 and 6 so we ordered the size 4 and it is perfect!! The dress also came in much faster it only took 12 days! Very happy with the dress and the service! Would order from this company again!,5

I get the rave reviews about the Queenie ke bras! Like a boobie hug. Will definitely buy more!",5
80362,"I am 135lbs, 5'7'' and 32C/D. It fit great, I even thought is was kind of big. The fabric is elastic but not flimsy. The top can accommodate much larger cups (even 34D/DD) but it does not have any support. You can still wear strapless bra with it, it won't show. I was kind of surprised the glasses had no lenses but for that price, I did not expect them to be real glasses. Overall, great buy. My fiance loved it.",5
172748,I bought my usual size (L) and it fit well. And the length was perfect. My only complaint was the colors. The picture is a bit different than what I received. I bought a turquoise shrug to wear with it. I should have waited until I received the dress because there was no teal or turquoise to be found in the dress.,4
667104,"Dont' buy this expecting it to hold up in Chlorine. I have worn this suit to 5 water aerobics classes and it has already become see through at the side seams, back, and chest. I contacted the company and they said no returns or refunds since it was already worn.  The cheap swim suits at local stores last longer than this ""Chlorine resistant"" one.",1

For a cheap watch this watch is nice ... I like the way this one lights up better than how my GShocks do ... It's obviously not as a high of quality , but it doesn't the job and doesn't look bad ... Not a badbuybin my opinion",5
16756,"I love my Havaianas. I live in these flip-flops so unfortunately I go through pairs pretty often. Kinda wish they somehow reinforced the button that holds the top part in the sole because that's where they seem to break on me always. I had my last pair a little over a year. Hated throwing them out since the soles still had good life left. but no way to fix, unless someone has any ideas?",5
613766,"These would not stay on my feet inside my shoes.  The heel would come off and bunch forward unless you pulled them on high enough to be above the lip of the shoe, defeating the purpose of having a hidden sock. I don't think they were sized wrong; they fit snug, but not too snug.  They just wouldn't stay on. I used them a couple times and gave up and chucked them.",1
870826,"I love this skirt! I did not want an a-line skirt but I also wanted to be able to walk. This skirt is stretchy but does not look like a jegging.  It is not a pull on though, it does have a button and zipper but I like that better anyway.",5
568190,"Although the shirt was a poor fit, it was still a nice shirt and the seller was willing to work with me in this instance to make up for my dissatisfaction. I often purchase clothing that is fit in Asian sizing and know to always check the size charts but this was more snug than I expected.",4
658122,"I had to purchase two of these to get the right size so buy up a size as the one recommended is too small all over.  I was also very aggravated that I had to pay to restock my item when I was doing an exchange.  I will not do business with Woman Within again over the fact that they were rude and customer service inflexible.

The coat is nice but remember it is short so spring/fall but definitely not for any type of sever weather.  Do like the hood",4
260069,The length was good but these are not for curvy girls. You have to pay your own return shipping to exchange the size so it made theses totally a waste of a purchase for me and I spend almost as much sending them back as I did for the original pants.,4
109226,It is an amazing watch love it although its kinda hard to figure out how to set to the right time but you'll get eventually. Also it came 3 days early which was AWESOME intact while i am reviewing this i am listening to L's theme i recommend this to any death note fan.,5
47072,"I have other visors and this is the only one I wear.  I'm ordering more colors for the summer.

was the winner!",5
99566,"The product arrived by the provided date. It was in great condition; camel color, leather, no marks or damage. It was just how I imagined it. I would order products from the seller in the future. This purse was of great quality for the small price. I would recommend this purse to any lady looking for a purse to match anything and one that is of good quality.",5
216494,"It's okay.  Prior to this hat I had a similar one made by Quicksilver.  On this one the brim curves down, rather than being flat.  That helps for blocking sun, but it makes it tough for walking up stairs because you can't see ahead.  I wore this for one week at a hot outdoor tennis tournament.  By the end of the week the top was starting to crack.  Next time I will go back to the Quicksilver hat because it lasted a bit longer and I like the flat brim.",3
864616,"I read reviews, read the size chart and looked at the photos- the description and details were a WOMANS tank. This is a tank top that uses JUNIOR sizing. Beware! I request a refund, they gave me half and let me keep it (the only reason why I give them a 2 star)- I donated it to a homeless shelter. $4.99 for nothing :(",2
532725,"Ive been wearing this gown since the weather has cooled and Im glad Ibought it.  The gown is warm and cozy, the length is perfect, and the sleeves reach my wrists.  Im a guy who likes feminine things, and I really like the trim around the wrists and neck even though the trim is not lace.  The trim adds a nice feminine touch to the gown.  The price is reasonable and I believe any guy or gal would be happy with the gown.",5
3272,"Fit a little large, so I ordered a size smaller(medium) and it fit nicely, loose even. Costume looked great and I got plenty of compliments. I'm a 34DD so I was worried about the top part, but it fit perfectly with a strapless self adhesive bra. Great for the price",5
846558,"To be honest they don't fit well. The wire doesn't fit right, I have very small breast and I expected the wire to touch my skin but it doesn't, feels uncomfortable ""floating"" there :( I must admit they look and feel nice though. Maybe I received defective ones, I don't know.",2
405181,"I love the cape on it! It actually makes a cute dress for fall.  The outfit by itself, has a ""Lolita"" look to it without being over-the-top. Black leggings go with this outfit great! If you are a size zero or a size one, it might have to be taken in if you wish for it to look more like the photo it is depicted with.",5
841037,This bag is so cute and i've gotten so many compliments on it!! At one point the zipper broke which was disappointing but I had a friend sew it back together and fix it for me and ever since then I have been very satisfied with it :-) The shipping was also much faster than I expected (came in about a week).,4
80355,One size is good for girls s/m size i think it can be too thight for L size...  i xs and it was a bit too large but on beck there is something like belt so You can adjust it to Your size.. Quality its not so bad compared with price. So 4 stars on 5 :),4
327888,the product is good in itself. We used it for our kids too...more of an adult size but worked for the kids too.  The reason for 3 starts is the very strong chemical / petrol smell that these Balaclavas had when them arrived. I washed them and sun dried them but the smell did not totally go away...was not very pleasant to wear them over the nose with that smell.  The draw strings are also a little tricky,3
775492,"SOOOO disappointed!  Whoever heard of a sweatshirt that needs to be hand washed and dried flat!  Really?  The fit is boxy and the sleeves are too full and too long with the wrist cuffs too wide.  And the material is thin...definitely not what I think of when I think sweatshirt.  Definitely do NOT recommend this.  Will be sending it back. (FYI...this refers to the black/white check patterned sweatshirt...not the hoodies, which got great reviews.)",2
44019,"When I was in college I had a bubble umbrella that kept me and my books dry and I could see through it to walk.  So when my last umbrella blew inside out in the rain, I decided to go to Amazon to see if I could find another bubble umbrella.  This one comes close.  We haven't had a windy rain since my purchase, so I'll keep my fingers crossed for this coming Fall weather in Seattle.",4
17714,I purchased this ring for myself and use it almost everyday!  It is just enough without being too much.  It is easy to wear seems to be made well.  Matches almost everything.  Was thinking about adding a single larger stone to the stack soon.  The size fit perfectly since I am a 5 sometimes hard to find.  I would recommend this ring for the price and look.,5
643431,"I have bought this dress to go to the wedding and it was amazing. I usually wear 6 but I chose 8 and it fits perfectly. The material is of high quality and I was very surprised since I had doubt about buying online. The dress was so beautiful that I received a lot of compliments. Also, everyone asked me where I bought it. I definitely recommend this dress when you know you size.",5
281572,"I bought these as a christmas gift. Originally I had a small hiccup with the shipping and processing of the gift, but it was smoothed out without any hassles. Once they arrived, they were beautiful, classy, elegant, and everything I had hoped for. When I gave them to my sister she loved them and wore them the very next day. They give you an excuse to want to dress up for any occasion. They're her new favorite pair and I am an extremely happy customer.",5
676923,"Nice wallet.  I bought it to replace a really nice Fossil wallet, but it's not as big as the Fossil the credit card slots are too small.  Really hard to get cards out when you need them.  But it looks nice and it well made.  Just wish it extended more on zipper seam.",4
405579,"I purchased fifteen of these for my class (I teach in a Catholic school).  They arrived in great condition and served the purpose.  A few weeks later one or two of the spring clasps has broken.  However, they still close and are workable (just a little more difficult to open).  Overall, I am happy with this product.",4
1270,"This was an absolute great buy! I purchased it for my father to put a cross on. When we got it, not only was it the perfect length, it matched the dazzle of the cross. He wears it everyday, and really loves it! It is a truly quality product, and dealing with the seller was an enjoyable experience.",5
799387,"Best bed socks I have found. They are comfy, warm, have non-slip buttons in case you want them as slipper-socks. They wash well and seem to be durable. They are thick and soft enough to help prevent bedsores on the heels for those who are bedridden. There is elastic in a channel at the top that could be binding on someone with large calves or edema, but it could be easily removed, and the bulkiness of the sock would still keep it from sliding off too readily. They are stretchy and fairly loose-fitting, otherwise.",5
512700,"Sizing was mostly as expected, on the small side. However it is short! Luckily there's a skirt on the thing so you don't see the massive wedgie this thing is causing. The seams were already torn on one side. There is zero lining or padding in this thing. And it is NOT flattering. I am 5'5"" and 125. I'm a size 2-4 usually. This thing makes me look like Shamu in a tutu.",1
556718,"Love this hoodie. If you order this make sure you order a size larger because it is sized smaller than usual. I usually buy a medium, ordered a large and it fits great. I ordered this with plans to work in, but is nicer than expected and now I don't want to ruin it. Arrived two weeks ahead of it's arrival date. I ordered the gray and it is a beautiful color and looks great on.",4
869773,I love this outfit! I bought this for my baby. It is super cute and is made of great material. It was a littlw bigger than I expected. But other than that cute. Ill just wait until she grows in it. Id rather it be big than too small. I did get this with Small discount for my honest review and I'm sobless I got this for my baby. Ive seen other outfits like this that are much higher in price. This is such a great deal.,5
13944,"My husband loves these insoles.  He has had plantar fasciitis (heel spurs) twice and his last podiatrist recommended these.  He has a set in every pair of his shoes and swears by them.  These insoles are not the soft gel type, but more the molded arch support type which he likes.  The heel is held in place by the cupped area and with the arch support it helps to keep the feet from moving around too much.  I hope they keep making these because it beats the idea of foot surgery!",5
269232,"Once again I didn't get this at a discounted price or free for my ""unbiased opinion""...I think Amazon ought to ban those reviews. But regardless, I received this dress and was shocked how tiny an xxl was. It looked like a pre teen dress. I'm not going to lie about how my measurements and say this dress could look good on anyone because it can't. It will show your every flaw if you're not a size 0. Run away from this one!!!",1
790974,"The glasses fit pretty tight so they don't fall off if you lean over. Very light-weight. It took me about a week to get used to the fit and get them broken in, but once I did I loved them. The rosey lenses are not quite as dark as pictured, but they don't give you the feeling that everything is pink or red when you wear them either. Look great on guys or girls.",5
603188,"According to the picture above, I would've absolutely loved this shirt, however, when it got to my house, it was not a ""sleeveless shirt"". It was a cheap looking tank top that doesn't look anything like the picture. I don't really care for tank tops. So it'll probably never get worn. And I don't want to deal with the aggravation of returning, so guess I'm stuck with it.",1
460397,"These sunglasses have held up to my teenager, who is not always nice to them! They have been dropped, kicked,sat on..etc... The little screw has tried to come out, but we tightened them and haven't had any problems. The lenses has also popped out, but you can snap them into place again. They do get scratched easily. The company send them in a timely fashion. Not, bad for the money spent.",4
535777,"The look of it was lovely but the fit was terribly off. When it was being purchased, the sizes said 52-54 cm. But in actuality, it was exactly 52 and it fits so exact that he can't wear it in the months ahead. Loved the hat itself, was disappointed with the fit.",2
107946,I bought these for my bridesmaids at my wedding. Their dresses were long Grecian style and royal blue  with a sash to tie around the waist. I gave them each one of these brooches to pin the sash instead and they all looked very pretty. They shipped on time and where in good condition.,5

I cannot believe that such a sickening product would be offered here or anywhere for that matter!

I am a small girl, I usually wear extra-small size, so it was a little big on me, I hope it can be tailored. Overall it's a nice dress for the price.",3
703266,Had to remove the hood so i could wear it while working (hooded jackets not allowed) but would gladly buy another so i can have have a hoodless and a hooded version. Fits perfectly.

785439,"The sizing is all over the place. It recommeds going up a size so i went from a medium to a large. The sleeves fit extremely tight while the chest balloons. The cuffs are the worst part. They have very little elasticity and aren't easily rolled up. It is just a poor fit all around.
The plus side is that quality is there for sure, and shipping is reliable. The red is a bit more orange than I liked though.",3
191261,It's a ok product..good for the price..it does run small I ordered a large and had to loosen it up a lot for me to get it on..it's a underbust which is cool but I don't like how it sticks out at the top where the underbust is...but overall the product is pretty cool it does look nice under clothes besides the top part sticking out,3

426511,"I bought this for myself and a friend as a gift. It holds many phones (nothing larger than a Galaxy Blaze though) and a few cards and some money. Clear ID holder on the outside too. The shoulder strap is removable so you can wear this as a purse or clip it to your belt or larger purse. Plenty of styles to choose from.

The manufacturer should consider making a large version too for e-readers.",4

I asked to send it back ... they are no paying for it and I need to send it back to China, I went USPS, I need to pay $24 to send it back ... more than the price of it ... Ridiculous.
So if you are sized like a model, buy it, if not ... avoid!",1

And, it will protect the original lining of my LV so that it won't get dirty, etc. There is plenty of space, it doesn't take away from the bag and it sits low enough in my purse that you can still see the LV lining. It's really nice!!",5

470223,"As commented by other buyers the cups on this top are quite small.  I wear a 36B and the medium was too small for me.  Cups also seem designed more for padding than for support so it is not very comfortable.  I was also disappointed that the white is not actually white, it is more like a light cream color.",3
688740,"The color of the dress is relatively similar to the photo online. However the fabric isn't as opaque. The dress is made with 2 layers however it's still super sheer. The slip is pretty short and can be seen through the skirt. Keep in mind, this brand does run small. I'm 5'4"" and around 135 pounds and I went up to a size medium which fit pretty well. Overall it's not a bad dress for the price although you'll most likely have to wear a slip with the dress.",3

152589,Got this shipped early and it is a bit smaller then the picture but one thing is that if you don't want the studs come off make sure super glue it around the studs and the other thing is that if does not fit into your lobe bend the back part up. Otherwise cute product. Dainty,4
667886,"Great for the price. I like the decorative ones the best, but wish they were adjustable. They two plain bands are adjustable, but they are much smaller that the decorative ones. Too small for my fingers (size 7 ring finger). They did the job though and convinced me that I like knuckle rings enough to invest more money in them!",3

It is pictured as being a very full skirt, and it is not at all full, really more of a straight skirt, with the over skirt barely fuller than the lining. It also took over a month to arrive.

I have a fairly average sized neck, yet it BARELY fit me.

This makes transferring them from shoe to shoe more involved than expected. However, they are very comfortable and helpful for long periods of walking and standing.",4
450800,I bought this for my daughter and her friend and the brim is way too large for them.  But the head size is too small for me.  So its pretty useless for us.  The quality of the hat is nice and the color is more soft than I expected.  I thought they would be bright yellow and they are more straw colored.  They were folded for shipping but seem like they will take shape just fine after a few days.  The wire in the brim is nice.,3

The fabric is very soft and the garment is well made.  It does not have the weird, children's clothing smell, that you are finding now days.  The blue trim is a soft shade and could be worn by a boy or a girl.  I would strongly recommend this outfit and any others by this manufacturer.",5

It is very beautiful and quite heavy (the right weight if you ask me).

It is quite attractive and fits my 2year old fine, although it is very roomy and clearly meant for an older kid so I think it will last my little guy at least a few years.  I searched extensively and as far as I can tell this is definitely the best buy on the market.  My son loves knights and dragons, and now he and his big sister can play prince/princess castle type games together.  Perfect!",5

The material weight looks like it will stand up to washing, so it can be worn more than once...And the way the ties are incorporated, makes this product adjustable for all size women..The top could use the same type ties, but I will add those..all in all, I am very pleased with this purchase.",5

It wasn't as big as I was expecting based on some of the other reviews, but it definitely covers most of your face (on me it was slightly above my forehead and slightly below my top lip). It's a nice sturdy metal, but thin enough to mold to your face if it doesn't quite fit right out of the box. The rhinestones are a smidge cheesy, but I left it as is because I didn't know if taking them off would damage the finish.

Great buy for the price!",5

It is a 0-3 months and we haven't tried it for a long period of outdoors so if that is your goal then I'm not sure how it would work.

The silver finish flaked and peeled off in a noticeable amount.  I notified EazyBelt customer service and they promptly replaced the buckle.  Great customer service.",4

Good for thicker material dresses on larger sized C/D women, the line is pretty thick where the bra edge is so you get some dimpling with thinner material.

I always use size 00 but for this one I ordered size 5 after reading all reviews. It fits perfectly on my waist but it's not too tight on thighs and legs which is want I exactly wanted. Khaki color is almost like nude which I also like. So happy with this purchase, probably will buy more color.",4
169835,"I LOVE these nose studs. I was very skeptical and did A LOT of research before I ordered. They are amazing. Good quality too. I'm still wearing my first one a month later, and the diamond still hasn't fallen out of the stud - imagine that! These will last me a long long time. I want to order the colored ones now!",5
402781,"This hat really does work for infants! I bought it thinking it like most other hats would be much too large for my 6mo son, but it synchs up nicely in the back. My only disappointment is the lack of color options! I bought a white one that I can dye, & will probably dye a couple more!",5
575481,"These fit my granddaughter to a tee and she is very picky at 4 years old about her clothes and shoes.  She loved them and wore them all night Halloween with her Princess Leia outfit.  She loves these boots and they are cuter than in the picture.  I only guessed at the arch support question as they are flat boots and really did not look at the arch support, but just how they felt on my granddaughter's feet.  Would recommend as they are adorable.",5
426109,This was the worst purchase ever! It looked NOTHING like the dress on the young lady modeling in the picture. The seams were misaligned. The bodice was misshaped. There was no way to hold the dress up due to no type of support in the supposed sweetheart neckline that was stitched in an oversized circle. It was a very disappointing purchase. I did not return the dress as a reminder NEVER to purchase dress from this site again.,1
232017,"I've been looking for a replacement for the discontinued Calvin Klein 365's for quite a while without success.  Finally I discovered these.  The most expensive I've purchased but hands down the best underwear I've ever worn.  Also repurchased.  Comfortable, lightweight, good wicking fabric, great support.  Tested on long flights and hikes.  Go for it!",5
637595,"Love, love, love this shirt. Makes a great gift for the Grandpa who has everything. The color is bright and the printing looks to be of high quality. I like how the color of the shirt shows through the printing a bit, giving it that vintage feel. It came in a nice bag with instruction on how to care for it. I love little details like that. :-)",5
154889,"Not necessarily as shown in the picture.  I expected it to be long and slouchy as indicated, but it wasn't.  Even though it was a size Large.  I ususally wear small/medium.  I kept it only becuase it's too complicated to send it back...(I rarely send anything back).  So, I'm using it for an after workout cover rather than pairing it with leggings like I wanted to.  Boooo...!  No Bueno!",3
659703,"I really like this shirt. It's material lends it to be dressy or casual depending on the bottoms that are paired with it. It does run big. I usually wear a M, but had to return it for a S as the arm holes and neck gaped too much. The small fits perfectly. (For reference, I'm 5'7"" 150#)",5
339276,"This is a pretty nice wallet.  The only downside is that the ID slot doesn't hold your ID securely.  The wallets ability to block RFID scanning is questionable as I have many key cards for building access that work without removing them from the wallet.  Having said all this, for the price its a good minimalist wallet.",3
291713,"I am 5'3 115-120 pounds and the S/M was pretty tight. However my thighs/butt are my trouble areas and I'm working to slim that down so with 5 more pounds lost it should fit perfectly. It definitely does the job! Good price for what you get. I've attached the pictures, first is without it and second is with it. I haven't tried it on with dresses, jeans, etc but I'm assuming it's invisible under those as well. If you're unsure about size I would say go up a size, the L/XL is probably more like a M/L for most people",4
700214,"I labeled these as somewhat small because I didn't realize they were mens socks and they are a perfect fit for me and I am a woman with size 6 shoe. So, I think they would be too small for man. I ordered by mistake thinking they were women's socks. BUT, I love them because they fit me perfect and they're thick and warm and real soft. Will order more. Super fast shipping too. A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A",5
94980,"I usually wear medium dresses but I ordered a large thinking this might be tight fitted fabric. It fits nicely, a little loose but falls nice without being tight anywhere. It's a very thin light jersey fabric so I will wear a cami dress under it. The stripes are way off but what can you expect for the price. The sleeves are full length. It's still very cute.",4
772646,"I normally wear a medium or large - decided to go with the xlarge to allow for shrinkage...and still, it's a bit snug. Very soft cotton, but the band around the bottom in particular, is too snug for my liking. I cut it off, below the seam, in order to be able to wear it comfortably. Which is a shame.",4
48322,"This is a great fitting belt and allows for more movement due to the stretching.  Not sure how long it will last, but so far it has been a great buy.  There are no eyelits for the belt buckel tongue, so it just fits into the belt wherever.  Like I say, I'm not sure how long that will last without shredding in that area.  So far, so good.  I went ahead and bought another one in a different color after using this one for a while.  Would buy again.",5
349470,"Nice, light, comfortable, cushy.  These shoes are great for indoor use and use at the water park.  They are not heavy duty, so I do not expect them to last long with regular use.  For the price, these are good.  They met my needs of having a lightweight , comfy, slip-on shoe to bring on vacation.",4
293741,Its actully larger than I thought it would be. The placement of the image in the glass was done well. the metal appears to be nickel but it is what I expected. chain is large enough i didn't need to unclasp it to put it on or take off. For its price its really nice. I wish I could find more items like this from the old Ranken Bass productions,5
433079,Nice thin cover-up.  I would have given it five stars but I'm using it for work to cover my armpits (service industry) when I wear tanks and it like to slide back in the pit area more than I would like.  I have to keep pulling it down and forward.  But great otherwise.,4
338098,Works like a charm!- Lifts and tighten/trains the waist. Im a size 18 and I can tolerate this on for 6 plus hours and it makes any pants look like BOOM!! Well worth it. The lace is annoying on thighs but pretty- not too problematic. It squeezes that tummy so I am please and will be tighter by Christmas-- appetizers and cocktails only in this thing--- no meals.!,5
69432,The fit is as expected considering you have to adjust it as you shrink down. It does crease or bunch if it's too low or high and do not sit up straight with it on. I gained 75lbs this pregnancy and by 4 weeks had lost 30lbs with no workouts per doctor. I am very happy so far with how my stomach looks at almost 2 months post part...IT WORKS but you have to wear it no matter what!,5
508765,"Right out of the bags, the handles were falling apart at the seems.  Love the look and the size, but the handles are sure to break quickly, unfortunately.  Would be a perfect beach bag of large towels, etc.  Even comes with a cute smaller zippered pouch on the inside (although no inside pockets).",1
660159,"These are really pretty! Blue stones are dark enough, but not too dark. Clear stones very sparkly.  Size is just right, not petite but not huge either.  The workmanship is very good.  They look far more expensive than they are.  I'm very pleased with this purchase.",5
737117,"I like the outfit, actually fits perfect. However, it would fit better if it had come with the black string for the back. Now I don't know what I am supposed to do because I cant close the back, which is in boostier form. I emailed the company, and have not heard anything. Instead of the string I got a green and red snowman wristlet that does not match. Highly disappointed",1
679323,"beats me what the design of  these purse hangers represent, but they are sturdy and hang a purse well.  my only problem is slight, they don't have a lot of space between the base and the hanger ( space between the table top and the open hook), so far there has been enough, so maybe it isn't really a problem.  I have used a purse hanger for ages, and I am sure these will serve well.",4
872326,"I ordered a Medium, but it fit like a small. I felt like the Incredible Hulk! It did NOT fit well, and it wasn't as long as the pictures depicted. The picture also shows that the jacket has some sort of lining, but what I received had nothing of the sort!",2
340675,"This is a high quality, well made bag. It is made of an excellent grade of canvas. The zipper pulls are leather. The shoulder straps are double padded & easy to adjust. The interior is padded for my laptop & has roomy compartments. The mesh pockets on either side are just right for bottles water or small items that need to be handy. It has a rugged vintage look that is so IN right now.  With this backpack, you could be heading for your next class or your next adventure.",5
508122,"I have a few Alex & Ani charm bracelets, so when I purchased this one I was a little disappointed.  I expected the Virgo design to have more detail.  Unfortunately it is as shown, just an outline of the ""Virgin"".  Although I kept it because it is just about always out of stock, I'm not crazy about the charm.",3
714900,"SUPER cute shirt! I was very hesitant at first buying it but so glad I did. I am 5'1 120 lbs and I went with a large. I typically wear a sm/med but the other reviews got me concerned. The large was a tad too big, but I think the medium would have been too small. I got so many compliments. I wore sticky boobs so nothing would show through the ties. It was adorable. I think wearing a bandeau or a bra would look goofy. It made the shirt sexy",4

Said it appears as if the wire going around was it's only means of being secure. sadly, since time had went past 30days unable to have it replaced. this being said, it is a lovely piece of jewelry. Size weight are perfect, just the stone fell out.",3
397426,"Considering the small price, these earrings are absolutely fantastic. I get many comments on how beautiful they are and what makes them even better is how comfortable they are on the ear. They look like real gold and much more expensive earrings. I just wish I could find a pendant to match!",5
460943,"If you want a unique baby clothing item, be prepared to pay for the Vera Bradley name. The patterns and styles are really cute and sweet so I don't mind buying one or two more pricey outfits. They don't stay in them long though! The fit was fine as was the quality. I'll buy another VB item again but wish they'd consider making the items more affordable.",4
752582,It certainly fits on my Pandora bangle and it's very detailed but it was marketed as a Pandora charm and it's opening is  significantly wider than the threading on my bangle. But it's the same quality silver as my actual Pandora charms. If you're a purist you won't like it though,3
611970,I was excited I got it in two days. The fit for the top is a bit lose in the outside of my breast. I'm a 32B and then the bottoms well it fits but so tight my skin looks like it wants to pop out inbetween the straps when I sperate them. I think if it was a bit bigger it be perfect. I'm going to stretch it out over time I'm sure. There than that the quality and color are great. That's what you get when you pay $13 for a suite.,3
650725,"Definitely go up a couple size unless you like the tight fit then go up 1 size.  I usually wear a small but bought a medium. Fit me well. Very comfortable but I can see it being very tight in the bosom for a big chested lady. Lol or if you have big arms because it fit perfectly around my arm for a medium.  I'm 4'11"" 108 lbs.",4
187181,This product fits true to size. I ordered an xl because most of the time stuff runs small but I actually could've ordered a large I have a little extra room. I normally wear a size 12 in bottoms and D at the top. My top fits perfect btw. And also came on time I love it!,5
332216,"I purchased mine in 25mm, & they are fantastic. I was worried because ordering ANYTHING opalite or even any organic material is a huge hit or miss, but these are so true to perfection. worth so much more for the price, this is honestly a steal. I truly recommend these for anyone. get them while you can ",5
848120,Funny and pretty shirt. This is the second purchase of this item. Bought one for a friend and another friends wanted one for her birthday. Was able to order hers in green. The material is soft and they are well made. The printing is durable. We have washed the first shirt several times and it has not faded or shrunk. Gets a lot of comments when worn.,5

UA is NOT consistent In their sizing. You should try on before buying. Her entire uniform collection runs between YM and women's XS. Once you get the right size, the clothes are great!",4

It may go weeks without getting washed and it has yet to fade or fall apart. I'll be getting the next size up for next summer for sure...",5
18986,"Love this hat! Material is breathable for hot days and dries quickly. I have tried a few other hats, but this is the widest brim I have found. Provides full coverage of my 8 month old baby's face, even when directly facing sun. I ordered a size up (9-18 mo) to get longer use from this hat. Although a bit roomy, the adjustable toogle allows me to adjust to his size and works well. I am also very happy with the neutral gray color.",5
546064,I bought an XL and XXL in this blouse. I gave both away. Sizing is horrible.  People from China are too dang small?? I probably needed a 4XL when I wear a 10-12 or XL in American clothes. This blouse is the classy and elegant looking.  JUST WISH  I COULD HAVE FIT THE BLOUSE!!,3
337971,"They fit as they should but you can definitely notice them in form fitting dresses and skirts. You can actually see the outline of the garment around the sides of the butt area and the crotch area is very weird. There's a layer that just sits oddly under your crotch. Almost looks & feels like excess skin. I would only wear these in Jeans, nothing else.",3
342467,"Super soft! I don't wear a bra to bed so I wanted something that was expectable to wear with a girls weekend trip to the mountains. These pajamas worked perfectly. It hangs off my chest so its not noticeable that Im bra-less. And the pockets are large enough And strong enough to hold my phone. The material is very thick, light weigh, and super soft. I highly recommend these pajamas.",5
544958,"This dress is beautiful and looks exactly like the photo. However, much like the other reviewers have been saying, the top is large. Not so much the chest portion, but the sides sort of hang down and look very unusual. I am 5' 7"" and weigh about 130 lbs and ordered a size 6. I am not even sure a 4 would have worked due to the odd shape of the dress. I was going to wear this for NYE but returned.",3

There are numerous areas to put business cards, credits cards, identification, money, coupons, etc. I have owned at least 50 wallets in my life, and this one has outlasted all of them. It is well made, and the stitching and fabric are sturdy. I would recommend this wallet to any and all horror fans.",5

Currently 5 months pregnant and this dress will be a staple in my wardrobe throughout and after the pregnancy - I'm just really pleased with the fit and quality!",5
274685,"The belt and buckle are of good quality and fashionable. I gave it 4 stars because IMO the ratchet settings on the belt should be closer to the end. When you cut the belt for a personal fit more than I would like sticks out from the buckle. If you cut the belt shorter to remedy this, the ratchets won't catch, they need to be about an inch closer to the end. I recommend this product but advise the buyer cut the belt to length in increments so you don't make it too short.",4

410484,These shoes were advertised to be made of leather they are not they are naugahyde the fit is much smaller then what it's supposed to be even in centimeters they did not get it right the size is incorrect I can't believe I actually spent $70 on rubber and naugahyde shoes I'll be careful next time so before anybody else buys these just just know that they lie on the ad they are not leather they are naugahyde,2
594521,Love wearing these. Took them on a cruise recently. Love that you can fold them up and button them at the bottom to make them shorter. One tiny issue though is that they sit low in the back. I'm a size 26 and felt they didn't come high enough over my big butt. Worried about others would see when I sat down - like my underwear.,4

The clasp seems strong even when it got caught on something and got tugged on a bit, it held up and didn't break.

The skirt in person is even more beautiful! And, being 5'7"", I wasn't expecting the skirt to fall mid calf as it did. It is a full circle skirt and I can't wait to wear it with a petticoat! All in all I'm 100% in love with this skirt!!",5

95229,"Like this blouse very much, and the size was perfect for me (Size M) Even when i was kind of afraid of buying this because of so many problems i read about the sizes. However this fits perfect (and i'm a skinny girl but with big arms and large breast). The only reason I don't give 5 stars is because the collar is poorly manufactured, somehow is big in one side and on the other the opposite. However ironing many times seems to do the trick. We'll see. And the shipping took time, even way more that expected.",4

114758,"First I ordered size Medium-  even  my size is 4 , or small in USA, Skirt was very, very small.,like it is size 2 or XS, Now when I ordered size large it appears like it is size  EXTRA LARGE ,  It is HUGE. When I compare it  whit size MEDIUM that I already can not wear it is very clearly at least  3 sizes larger.-very disapointed. It would be very cute and comfortable to wear if sizing is  with a little bit more sense.",2
419885,"We have about a dozen of these various masks that we wear for fun.(my 4 kids and I wear them on family walks lol) Most all of them have visibility issues and are too uncomfortable for any prolonged use, and this one is no different, but hey, they're just for fun, right?",4
814063,"Too small. I'm a US size 10/12 so I ordered a Large to fit 12/14, I couldn't even get dress over my head. I probably would have to order XXXL and I'm only about 170lbs. The large looked like it was for someone veeeeeery thin, no hips no bust. Other than that the dress is veeeeeeeery cute",4
395187,I had a feeling they would run small so I ordered one size up and they fit perfectly. Even if I lose a few pounds the drawstring waist can adjust. I ordered the camo pants from the men's clothing section because the drawstring waist option wasn't available in the women's clothing section. I love them! ,5
344284,"Had it for a few days now. Slept in it, work with it on, haven't showered with it yet but I'm sure it won't damage the necklace. Pretty solid, I use it to hang my ring on it that much fianc got me since it's too small. I got the 24 inch which allows me to take off and on easily without having to unhook it.",5
428426,"Looks good on my  6 yr old son, comfy and seemed sturdy shoes. The
first time i bought this sketchers. Got it in wide
to have room for the socks and I'm glad I did it coz its kind of tight. So go size up if you don't want
IT to be tight.
Liked the mesh that surrounds part of it so it can be bent when he plays on
the floor, of course the velcro is great so its easy to put on and off. Happy with the purchase, hopefully it will last at least for the whole school yr.
round.
Thanks.",5
235969,"I have wide hips (42"") and narrow calves. These fit comfortably, I have full range of motion, and they drape beautifully. The material feels like heavier t-shirt cotton. The images are fairly accurate as to fit and general appearance. They are well stitched and excellent quality for the price paid.",5
87389,"Bought my first Pandora silver bracelets and charms at a Jewelry store. I have 6 granddaughters and wanted to start a quality bracelet for them. I looked on Amazon to see what was offered there  On Pro Jewelry, Elizabeth Charms, and others thru Amazon you get lovely sterling for a fraction of the price of theJewelry store.  Some  sites like Pro Jewelry have free shipping. I am sold on them (pun intended).",5
62330,They fit perfect ! I have had 2 c sections and they helped keep everything in place just like a girdle! The only down side is def the price these are way over priced I have had the same high waist under wear for a reasonable price that to the same exact thing! I thought the specific of a c section panty would do more but not really.,4
717913,"Unfortunately, I was expecting this top to be a bit more substantial.  It's cute, but the material is sooo thin it doesn't really have a shape to it.  Just sort of hangs off me.  Not the polished look I was hoping for.  I ended up giving it to my daughter.",2
590548,"love this shirt. it is big and baggy, but that is what I love about it. it fits just like I the picture and I and much bigger then her. May not work well for thinner people. This is my 3rd shirt in this style and I get compliments on them all the time.",5
179443,"I'm normally a Small-Med fit. Due to other reviews, I realized this shirt ran small so i ordered a XL.  I was looking for something long enough to wear with leggings. This shirt is the perfect denim however it is extremely small. I ordered 2 sizes bigger and I still can't wear it. It fits like an extra small. Very tight in the chest and doesn't come close to covering my backend. Very disappointed!!!",1
877632,"I REALLY wanted to love this dress. The pattern is so cute and the ""fit and flare"" style is perfect. Sizing is accurate, but the big complaint I have (and why I returned it) is that the seams are SO itchy! Unless you can wear tights that come all the way up to the waist to cover them, you'll be miserable wearing this. Also, you can't see this from the picture but the fabric is really thick. I live in Arizona, so this would be much too hot to wear in the summer.",2
695268,"Love this dress! Fits true to size. The material is very stretchy and comfortable! Looks exactly as pictured and perfect. I've never ordered clothing from this company, and for the price I was expecting it to be a cheap material, but it's not. It's fantastic and I definitely recommend ordering this dress!",5
72355,Truthfully I didn't quite understand the description. Is it for a little kid or is it for women or both? In any case I find them very wide for a toddler. Maybe I should return them because lengthwise they fit but seem too wide. I got this size because it is the next size up from what she has now. Are the Crocs getting wider? Either that or they are trying to market the same shoe to both grown up and small children-don't think that is so great.,3
324058,"I was hoping the sleeves would be longer. The material is thin so its great for the fall/spring. I also thought it would be the same length all the way around but the back is about waist line and the front comes down to my thighs. I wear a large but ordered a xl and its almost skin tight in the arms, which is fine by me but if you want a baggier look I would go a size or two up from your normal size.",4
553411,"So i just want to be clear i love the pattern and they are adorable. They fit right and weren't see through as some of the other reviews said. Here was my major point of disappointment, there was points throughout the stitching that just weren't finished! There was two holes in the crotch and along my calves. I am going to keep them and hand stitch them myself but disappointed",2
414495,I wanted this to match the earrings I ordered from same seller and it too is very pretty. The picture doesn't do it justice. I love marcasite and this will go nicely with my earrings. Very pretty and a nice size too. Absolutely love it!!Thanks Gem Avenue for another beautiful piece of jewelry!!Recommend seller very highly!!A++++in all aspects of transaction.,5
63655,Very nice costume!  Sizes do run a bit large so buy down one size.  The leg covers slip down.  Might try holding them up with a garter belt or just not wear them at all.  Either way the costume looks great!  Can't wait to wear it!,5
853447,"I was pleasantly surprised at how fast my order came in. And I actually ordered  a medium expecting it to be a little small and it fit just right. I'm losing weight for vacation so I'm just going to have to order the small in another color. The top fits great and has pads that can be removed or left for some push up if you need it. The material is soft and much better made then I expected for such a low price. All in all, I love it.",5
97786,"Doesn't fit on me like it does on the model, looks more like a sweatshirt, but a cute sweatshirt at least! At first I didn't like it as much, but it came in handy for the cold winter. I have washed it over and over again and is still in very good condition. Size fits as expected.",4
370990,The style and funtionslity is very nice. I haven't used it on a trip yet so I do not know how it will hold out. The only issue was I ordered the color brown based on the picture but the actual color that arrived was a Carmel light brown. I didn't return it because the other color options didn't meet my needs but would have liked the darker color you should change the picture.,3
666599,"Swimsuit cane right on time. I'm 5'1, 34B. And I decided to go with a medium instead of a small based on the reviews. It was still a little tight on my button but I'm hoping that it'll stretch out a bit. I'm also giving it 3 stars because the padding isn't sewed in properly, it falls down to my stomach. Overall it's a great suit for the price that it is.",3
570274,"I have to say-I loved this shoulder bag, but it was just a little too big for me to carry as a purse.  Since I had to buy another, I ended up returning this one, but I'm quite sure I will go back and purchase it again.  It was so nicely made and the color was a perfect cherry color with brown leather.",5
627323,"It's a good hat.  Well made.  A little too hot for the summer.  As far as appearance goes, it's not a ball cap or a trucker, it takes some getting used to.  On top of all that, the denim is heavy and good quality (surprise!), and needs to be broken in.

Talk to me in 5 years and I'll say best hat ever.",4
822288,"This shirt is very cute but ran VERY small. I wear a Large in pretty much every brand, and after reading reviews that said order up a size I ordered an XL. Unfortunately, this XL fit like a small! Definitely order up at least a few sizes and don't even try it if you're at all busty.",3
871950,"This fit pretty good, the arm length was nice as I have shorter arms and I didn't have to roll it up.  It worked beautiful with my black dress and I got quite a few compliments.  I love it and would buy it again, what a great price.",5
105576,The size of the ball chain is a bit too thin for me but it gave me a great idea for a Valentine gift for my girlfriend. I'm buying a larger size from this merchant for myself. Its a great quality necklace and I'd definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a ball chain necklace. Great product!,5
700432,"They are beautiful and look great. It has a very classical shape, so it looks good on any woman. It sparkles!
It is also very comfortable to wear all day long, they are not heavy.

EDIT on 10/02/2016: almost a year later, they don't look as nicely. They don't sparkle anymore and have that greenish build up that develops in usually cheap jewelry. I still use it every now and then, I just wish it would hold up its beauty. If any of you know how to clean it without damaging, please let me know, I would really appreciate.",4
783655,"This backpack looks good but there are a few details that bring the quality of the bag down, the lining on the inside is some weird mix of plastic/cloth material, very stiff; the canvas on the outside is nice though; the zippers are a bit rough, definitely a lower quality zipper (it works fine though); the size of the bag is decent, though you definitely cannot fit a standard sized laptop in, has to be more tablet sized. Not bad, not great; you basically get what you pay for.",3
542181,"the item did look like the picture, however I am only 5'5, and the outfit was extremely short on me. This would be better suited for someone who's like 5 feet and under. The material was a bit thin, almost see through. Which was okay, but this looked more like a shirt than an actual mini dress",2
818874,This ring is perfect. It was shipped very promptly and arrived before the expected delivery date. The fit is excellent (size 4) and the engraving work is beautiful. My fiance and I purchased it as a wedding ring for her and she absolutely loves it. All around an excellent product and excellent service.,5
200365,they are super cute. however when they said that they had to be tied I thought that meant you could adjust the size. NOT AT ALL. the circle is one size and then there's a small piece that you tie onto the large circle. i may try and cut and sew it myself to make larger. fabric is soooooo cute,2
865848,"I love the top, the only thing I disliked was the straps are long and they don't adjust enough. So I had to tie  the straps in a bow, which worked out fine. And looked great, Size  wise I'm a 36C so I ordered  a XL . I usually wear size 10/12 or Large in shirts.",4
250410,"It is a great product and this is the second one I have purchased.  The first one did not lock, but it still served it's purpose.  This specific model locks, however, there were no instructions on how to retract the shaft when extended and locked.  I finally figured it out by accident.  Hold both ends, pull or push and then TWIST to unlock.  The spring at the bottom offers flexibility allowing use at different angles, works everytime!",5
180552,"quality is good and the jacket looks stylish and awesome but the 3XL is deffinatly a 3X. I have shorter, beefier arms and shoulders so usually when a jacket is listed as ""fits small"" I have to go up two sizes. Not this one! I actually get to go down two sizes!",4
88325,"I would say these run perhaps as half size large, but I added an extra insole and they are super comfy. Easy on, very light, and a bit more interesting than a pair of sneakers. The sole are very flexible and grip well. For the price these shoes are fantastic.",5
449398,"I purchased these shoes for my granddaughter.  She only wore them for a couple weeks and they completely fell apart.  I mean, the actually disintegrated as she was walking down the hall of her school.  I am going to send them back to you in hopes that you will give me a full refund on them.  It was very disappointing to her because she loved them when she got them.  I would like information so that I may be able to return them.

Thanks",1
752229,"Very sexy and cute!! I had to pass it on to a friend because my boobs would not fit in it though. She wears a size 0 and said her ass was hanging out of it, which is expected for a romper lol it is adorable and I wish I could have worn it",5
588,"My husband goes through quite a lot of these tshirts. I noticed the last time I ordered, they came out of the dryer (with an all white load of clothes) with a  pinkish tint. He used them anyway and I continued to wash them. Eventually that tint went away. I ordered 3 packs this time. 2 were made in Bangladesh and one in Haiti. Sure enough, after I threw them in the dryer to fluff up, all 3 of the Haiti-made shirts had the pink tint, while the Bangladesh ones were still white. Who knows....",4
831063,"After reading other reviews I ordered a large instead of a medium. I'm 5'3"", 120lbs and wear a 34C bra. When opening the package I was really worried I made a mistake in ordering a size up. After trying on, the fit is a little loose but not too big. I'm very excited about this suit for the price! The bottoms are very low cut but the top is flattering and nice. The color is beautiful.",4
79256,"I was not sure I wanted a wedge this high!  This fits wonderfully and is so comfortable. I have worn them with my white skinny jeans and loved them!  THey will go with everything!  The material is gold, it is more muted shade---still with sheen---but it is nice.  It doesn't scream metallic!  Loved them so much I got them in navy blue as well!",5
724103,"I wore this belt the first time for a 12 hour shift installing cabinets. Lots of heavy lifting, bending over, kneeling, up/down ladders, etc. The belt never loosened or moved, the buckle fastens very well. The belt itself seems to be very strong, perfect blend of comfort and stiffness. No deformation thus far. After destroying other leather and cotton blend canvas belts in the past I'm optimistic with this one..We will see how it holds up to repeated shifts over the next few months.",5
56662,"The item came on time, however, they are abit larger than expected, and alot darker than expected, i ordered nude colour and it came very dark taken into consideration that am not that fair. i guess they should do more light colours the nude colour is much more like a dark tan.",3
450723,"This eye glass holder is crap & I'm very disappointed. I've been wanting this item for a long time, but thought it was a bit pricy for fake pearls. Getting a gift card for Amazon for x-mas , I bought them & 2 days later they've been repaired 3 times! They are going back w/much disappointment!",1
46471,"I cant live without these. I don't like wearing hats but my ears get super cold very easily. Ive been using this brand for years and like them better than any other brand. They stay on and keep my ears warm. They fit over ear buds, too. Worth the money for sure.",5
427006,"Ordered PM but was way to large.  Too costly to return, so the dress was given to a friend with hopes it can be utilized.  Dress was of excellent quality.  Wife needed a PS but was unavailable at time of order.  Will give 5 stars due to outstanding service from the company.",5
292164,I love displaying these. Very well made. Only one very minor flaw on the rainbow badge where the glaze didn't smooth out properly in manufacturing. I don't take anything away from the score as it is the more complex of the badges and 1 out of 8 is not bad with all the others perfect!,5
55212,"I am really annoyed by the sizing chart.  I have ordered two sizes of crocs now and both have not fit ""normal"" child sizes.  My son wears a 1 and ""little kid 1"" is way too big on him.  12/13 is way too small.  The size chart should be corrected.  Returning.",2
340455,Its great. I really enjoy it. I wear it upside down for more comfort. Im 55 135 size 8. This fits me perfectly. It is really stiff. Not much give. Its exactly what I needed after my liposuction.  The only down side is I had to wait 5 days for it /:,5
677359,"This bag is just perfect.  Looks great, nice and roomy, and enough pockets and compartments.  I especially appreciate the variety of ways you can carry it with the extra straps and handles.  I am not easy to please but this bag is a real winner.  I just hope it can hold up against abuse.  Unfortunately I tend to be rough on my purses.",5
844793,"way too small and the zipper was completely crooked. Also, you can't really tell from the picture but that little fold in the front of the shirt is actually made by them cutting it into a triangle and folding it over on its self and sewing it like that. It is totally ridiculous",1
331931,"I wore it about  8 times and this morning I noticed the tip of the hook was not ""right "". It was brass colored and wouldn't stay in the hole I put it in. I'm not sure but I think the tip came  off the post. I'm afraid to wear it now thinking it will not stay on.",1
156825,This arrives in a very nice case and very well packaged.  It's beautiful!  It has a place for all cards I carry and easy to handle and open.  I love it!  Just press a button on the side to pop it open with a button. It doesn't fly open and spill the contents either.  It stops at a certain point to protect your card.  The hard case is protective and keeps my cards safe.,5
421334,"I ordered extra large because of previous comments on size. It was way to big for me.  I gave it a try despite the size and found it's okay, just extra material. Still comfortable since I don't care for a tight fit. Good for a bit of a chill in the air, not for winter cold, nothing below 32 deg.",4
628061,"It was advertised as having butterflies on it, but mine didn't have any butterflies on it at all.  I was very disappointed.  I think it just depends on each wallet and how the fabric was layed out at the time of manufacture.  The quality and functionality of the wallet is great though.",2
235319,"Just gorgeous - I can tell you how really beautiful this piece is  but to really appreciate it you have to see it up close.  I often worry that when ordering something which has alot of stones that many will become disattached during its travel but this time everything was itact when I got it.  The only thing is that it took forever to arrive, in fact I had about given up on it when it showed up in the mailbox.",5
104311,the purse is good but the conceal compartment zipper has plastic 3 time I unzipped it it would not zip correctly  The zipper split so that it leaves the concealed pocket open.  I managed to get it to work but the next time I unzipped it it would not latch back together.  I had paid $80 for it and that was less than 6 months use.  I don't know if I can get the zipper replaced or not,2
143756,i love that the garter has been repurposed to be both sexy and functional. My iPhone fits well in it (I don't have a protective case on it to give it bulk). I haven't tried wearing it while biking around the city yet and would probably be cautious of that but for ordinary use - this works well.,5
195062,I really love cocks and this is no exception. I really enjoy how tight it wraps around my neck and hangs down low almost to the curve of my breasts. I have a new obsession with cocks after getting this beautiful piece and am now looking for more cocks to surround myself with.,5
588028,"RUNS SUPER SMALL!!!!!!  Sadly, I'm having to return this.  I got the Large and it was like Chris Farley 'fat guy in a little coat'.  The shoulders were tight and the sleeves were at least 3 inches too short.  So, if you normally wear a Small or Medium, then maybe the Large sweater would be ok for you.  Other than the sizing, it is a cute style.  I wish they had bigger sizes so I could have one.  

Also, it is 100% Acrylic, so if you want natural fibers, this is not it.",4
339272,"This is the perfect size and style to keep a slim wallet.  The only issue I found was when upgrading from the previous model to this new RFID blocker model, it was a bit harder to break it in.  Also, the ID holder could be improved.  I still find mine sliding occasionally.",5

Still searching for something to keep them in place better. Other than that, they rock!",4
263646,"Buy larger size for sure.  I'm 30-32 waist, 34 inseam, usually Medium for underwear. Bought a Large (very appropriate heads up on sizing on Amazon site) and fits quite well, toward snug. A Medium would have been much too small I'm sure.  So far quality seems fine, but probably won't know until it's been through several washings and wearings. Definitely see-through, but not transparent. Sexy. And great price. Was in my U.S. mailbox in 3.5 weeks",5
232063,"Love these pants, so much that I ordered a second pair.  But I noticed that, though they fit great when on, the seams are already coming out in the crotch area, and you have to be VERY careful when putting them on or seams come apart in the waist if you stretch them when pulling up.  It seems like, though the pants are very stretchy, the thread or stitching used to MAKE them is not meant for stretchy clothes.",3
872303,"While this was only $7 at the time I purchased it, it starting breaking with only a month of gentle use. I would have thought to get 6 months to a year out of it. It does have a lot if different pockets and if it would have held up matetial wise the functionality is great.",2

824791,"I can't not be more happy about this purchase!! It is so perfect. I am in love with the unique design. The pearl in between the pear shape is so pretty in person than in picture. Also, price is very affordable  it makes a great gift for any occasion or for self.",5
22311,Super cute hat. Drawstring circumference and chin strap w tie helped it stay on my baby sons head during recent trip to the beach. All other hats he pulled off. Once he realized he couldn't get it off though it was comfortable enough on him that he could forget about it and just have fun in the pool. Sun protection very important to me and I love the visor and neck protector! So cute! Seems to clean easily.,5

I tried them on and the legs have plenty of length, but when I tried to pull them all the way up they stopped short by about 5 or 6 inches.

342228,"The dress is very pretty. For the price you are paying, it is great quality. With regards to sizing, I have to say you would need to go up 2 sizes. I went up 2 sizes than my actual sizing and it fits perfectly. I am 5'10 and the length is perfect, long enough, which is an added bonus as its hard to get good length maxi dresses. Overall it is a great purchase.",4

I needed something to showcase my mother's wedding dress at my wedding and this will be perfect for it, and will be great decoration in my first home.

Great price and worth purchasing if you are looking for a nice mannequin, I definitely recommend!",5

My feet are very happy with the result. I simply used a 50/50 mix of water and rubbing alcohol to saturate the boot leather. Then, inserted the boot stretcher and cranked the screw to stretch the width of my boots. I left the stretcher in place for 48 hours. The stretcher saved me months of uncomfortable break-in time.",5
293145,These worked well for me after my daughter was born. They are easy to unhook in the front. I like that they have inserts that can come out. The inserts also provide enough coverage that you do not see anything through the shirt that you don't want to be seen. They are very comfortable and I can even sleep in them if I choose to.,5
878182,I love these sunglasses. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of them and the speedy delivery. They feel expensive and luxurious and they have a little weight to them as well.

I can't wait to order from them again.,5

Otherwise, it is a cute shirt.",4

It fits the slightest bit snugly but I think he likes it that way. He's 5'11'' and about 200 lbs. I think the XXL probably would have fit him even better, but this is fine. The fabric is thin, but looks great when layered with things. Hes very happy with it.",4
217030,"Wow,  it is big.  The head that would fit this hat would have to be huge.  My head did not come anywhere close to fitting this hat.  It is called a lifeguard hat and I would think that all you could do in a hat this size would be to lounge and it would keep your entire body shaded.  I gave it two stars because I didn't like it.",2
714891,"I'm normally an xs or small. I ordered this shirt thinking it would fit fine.. it fits OK but if I move around the arms slide up and it gets a bit tight. Also I messed up and cut the strings after only lacing it halfway. After lacing the top, I then looked at other pics to see I should have laced it all the way. Bummer. This top is very mediocre. Not worth 15 bucks. Looks cheap.",3
346404,"I love these! It's  perfect for my haru cosplay. I have not taken them off since they arrived. My only complaints are that it's pretty thin and the waist band is pretty tight and gives me weird rolls that I don't typically have. Over all, though, I'm pretty satisfied.",4
77636,"This helps with back pain a lot. A small fits good and the band has a lot of Velcro room on either side to be smaller or larger so I anticipate it will fit throughout my pregnancy and post-partum.  I'm 5'6"" and was about 125 lbs pre-pregnancy and am now about 140 lbs at 29 weeks.",5
487652,Very disappointed! I ordered these for my boys for Christmas Eve night. Normally I would personally shop but due to foot surgery I was forced to shop online. These arrived on time but being Dec 22nd there was no time to return them or order a replacement. Misspelled words and earmuffs that look like horns makes for one very unhappy momma.,1
634403,"The face on this watch is so big it would only fit a large man. The quality is so poor I do not know if the clasp would withstand one wearing. This is almost a you don't even get what you pay for. Also, the time dots are black and not gold like they are shown in the listing picture.",1
784563,"The artwork stays in nicely even after multiple washes its a nice color and warm for those cold days, i just wish it had pockets but thats ok gives me an excuse to walk out with my zelda wallet XD we don't get many Zelda swag with Princess Zelda actually on them so its great to have for any princess zelda fan.",5
858577,Tri blend shirts tend to have more of a slim fit than the standard cotton shirt. This shirt is no exception without being overly so. This is good if you have a more slender child. The length is true to size. It has held up to many washes/wearings with little to no shrinkage.,4
92798,"Fit was perfect, matches my existing suit. I bought these because losing weight but , current suit still fit in top and was getting big on bottom (which is good thing) but needed coverage,  these swim shorts work great. worn shorts for about two months and will need to get smaller size. FYI, do not ruin by putting in wash with fabric softner,  or in dryer. That will break down fibers in shorts and make them look funky. But That was on me, the shorts are great, love them and price is all right for my modest budget.",5
439892,"It is a nice Half mask, but i think with the type of material they used it will lose its stretchability fair quick, the material is very thin and it is made in china, but then again, these days what isnt. It is fun to wear, and i really have no bad things to say.",3
812866,These are awesome to use during the summer in tank top season. It rounds out and bushes up the bust without having to have bra lines in your blouse. The mango color is very nice and looks great next to the skin. It's extremely feminine! Definitely would recommend! Order a size or so up to fit you best!,5
390712,"Very poorly made. The dangling stone had some brown glue stuck all over it. It's not even shiny. And I can't get the nasty brown glue off. On top of that, I only received 1 ear cuff even though the picture shows 2, and so many people received 2 cuffs according to the questions. Seems like they just randomly pick who to give 1 to and who gets 2.",1
620404,Very small more like a childs XL. Material not what i expected. Wont buy anything like it again on line. Was cheap and not worth the wait. I even had my daughter who wears a Medium. The cut was not made for anyone who has more than an A bra,1
292032,"I got this for somebody from a gift exchange!

The badges are great. Their colors are super vibrant and the pins seemed secure. The only thing that could be improved is the box: There were large globs of glue which made the package look cheap. Besides that though, this makes the perfect gift for any pokemon fan :)",4
171166,"Awful product. Save your money. The image is deceptive. The product looks nothing like it. It is not a waist trainer but a poorly crafted and very uncomfortable item. I have had other trainers and this is not a good one. Will not work and you will regret having purchased it. It took a ridiculously long time to arrive and if you can finally get the correct address to send it back to China, you have to pay for the postage. So NOT worth it.",1
841116,"So, we really wanted this dress to work because it looks great in the listing pictures, but the thing was way too small and tight. We first ordered the small, but couldn't get it past hips, so we re-ordered in the medium, but couldn't get it zipped. And it is short, and she couldn't fill out the top well. She normally wears XS or Small, but we gave up on it. She is 5ft, 125lbs, size 3, 34A, so maybe someone leaner would work with this dress.",3
394832,"Ordered a medium based on measurements provided - fit perfectly! Very sexy, can't wait for my wedding night! Very pretty and delicate. Probably a little flimsy/cheap compared to a nice brand, it feels more like costume outfit than anything else (I expected as much based on the price). But still very sexy and definitely not something my hubby will notice!",5
499706,"This hat is NOT well made. My 12 year old daughter saved her money to buy this hat for me for Christmas because she knew how much I wanted it. When it arrived I noticed how cheap the material was compared to another veteran hat I own. It is thin and just feels cheap. The worst part is the embroidery. The ribbons were sewn badly. They were misaligned and different sizes. When I served, I was all about military bearing... this hat has none. Don't waste your money or let your daughter waste hers.",1
362056,"Good all around holder for your reading glasses or TV remote! We purchased several of these to keep our reading glasses clean and handy in several locations around the house. I would recommend these to anyone who keeps multiple pairs of reading glasses throughout the house, RV, boat, etc. They also work great for keeping your TV remote accessible rather than lost between the couch cushions or easy chair. They also come in several colors to match your decor! Pretty sweet little holder...",5
564360,These looked like they were used or had been on some storage room's floor for long time. The printing on the glasses had many scratches. The wrapping was kind of grose (disgusting yellow tape in what seems liked a used stereophone box). This came straight from China ...The contamination produced in sending it back is higher than what the product is worth. I would not put this on my child's face (plastic and colorants that who knows what they can do to your skin)...this goes to the garbage.,1
537852,"Good shirt. Perfect for anyone who loves Doctor Who. I have washed it several times now and the design is still going strong, hasn't shrunk or faded in any way, and fits well. I get a lot of compliments when i wear so i wear it a lot. Very happy with my purchase.",5
176647,Even though they sent the wrong size I'm happy they did cause a large would have been to small. These swimwear are made small so I really needed an XXL and Thanks for sending that size fits me perfect. I wear a large in everything else LOL Thanks again I'm loving it!!,5
278700,"Love this dress! The material is nice and cool. I was just disappointed that the belt it came with did not fit me at all. I have a small waist (despite having a muffin top)  and even though I put it to the last hole, the belt sagged terribly so I am going to have to add a hole. And the belt is made form rather cheap material even though the color is perfect and really compliments the dress nicely.",4
19016,"The perfect summer hat for my 1-year-old and 3-year-old daughters!  I ordered the 2T--4T size for both of them. Thanks to the drawstring, it fits both of them.  I am so glad,  because it is hard to find a wide-brimmed sun hat that fits my 3-year-old,  who is the size of your average kindergartener!  I do think that this hat is a more feminine style, so it may not be ideal for little boys,  but ultimately that would be a personal style choice. :-)",5
684208,"The skirt is very cute, but is definitely not chiffon.  It is instead a floaty lightweight net, like a softer tulle.  The bow is not attached but is a length of the same cloth for you to tie into a bow, which is convenient to use as a scarf or a sash otherwise.  The color is a strong crayola green, which is exactly what I needed.",4
255181,I had to alter it and it still needs more alteration. I bought a 12 and my daughter wears a 12 but this was about 2 inches too big at the top. Maybe they thought she was a size 12 with a DD chest????? anyway it was cute after I took it in. I don't know what I would have done if I did not sew.,3
238006,"This is a great case and looks beautiful. The only reason I took away a star is because it came in brown, not black. When I purchased the case I was under the impression it was black. Other than that the leather was very nice and I had no other problems.",4
465619,Can't really rate the comfort due to the size. I had read other comments that said to order a full size larger. I found this not to be the case. I returned (at my expense)and reordered a half size larger than my normal hoping that will fit properly. I usually ware dinners or under armor that seem to be true to size. I look forward to experiencing this boot and rating them appropriately.,4
101019,"Fits as expected. Keeps my junk in place but the only thing is that it rides up sometimes and gives me a wedgie. That's why I'll only give it 4 stars. For the most part it doesn't do that but those times that it does ride up, it gets uncomfortable. The cotton and material is soft so they get points on that.",4
628686,"The pleats are not finely pressed, even pleats. The waist is just gathered. The shade of pink is darker than the ad shows. The ""gold chain"" choker is different too.  They basically recreated the dress shown and the details are totally different. But for the price, it is still a flattering dress. In the photo I've attached, the model is about 5'3"", thin build, and is wearing an XS. This would be a great budget bridesmaids dress.",4
157953,"Don't get earrings like these unless you know what you're doing. I thought I did so I tried putting them in myself. Bad idea! Lucky for me my best friend helped me put the beads in. Once in, they really won't come out. 4 kids and 2 months later they haven't moved. :)",5
670642,"i wear a 4.5 in boys, 6 in women's and have chubby feet and they fit almost exact with thick socks. no complaints here, i haven't worn them except to try it on and walk around to get an idea of how they fit. i got these to go with an outfit, kind of a one time wear but they're cute, so i might wear them for other occasions. will add photo when available.",5
82140,"I can't find anything bad to say about Herschel. I've tried the affordable name-brand backpacks and the quality doesn't quite beat Herschel.
My 8 yr old and 12 yr old sons both enjoy using Herschel. The product can be expensive but well worth the buck. Watch out for fake Herschels out there. I recommend to purchase from an authorized distributor or Herschel direct",5
349122,"I bought two of these for my bottom lobe piercings and they are so pretty. They're easy to put in and take out, and so far it seems like they'll be harder to lose than the other types of jewelry I wear in my ears.. Just be aware that the opal is only on one side (which makes sense for a septum piercing) so if you wear them in your lobes you'll have to put one in from the back of the piercing.",5
69986,"Very resistant to my crushing 3 year old boy! He loves to be rough and these have held up very well. They are slightly smaller than I would have expected, I will probably pass them on to his younger brother soon. All in all, best sunglasses we have owned for our little ones, would definitely buy them again!",5
745709,"I really like these leggings. Very soft! Super stretchy and vibrant in color. I am 5' 3"" about 116 and they are a touch bigger and longer than I would like, but they are one size, so I was expecting that. I have already washed them and hung them to dry and they seem to be holding up well. The price was spectacular and I am happy with my purchase.",5
510350,"Its underwear for heaven's sake. Good quality, good price, good fit, but I just can't give it five stars. Roll the statement ""I love my underwear"" around in your mind. Just too weird, right? Don't get me wrong, its a good product but ""I love my underwear""... give me a break!",4
487184,"I was skeptical when looking at the pictures for this dress. It's not a style that I've worn before, but I thought I would take a chance on it.

I love it as the casual, easy to care for dress that I wanted. The size was perfect, the fabric is soft and pretty. It's a practical dress with a bit of a unique style. Perfect for me! I don't wear it much but I like having it around.",4
586157,"I usually wear XXL in Genie Bras.  Since the designs were similar, I thought the same about these bras.  I have found them to fit a bit small and I'm hoping, in time and use, they will stretch out a bit.  Otherwise, they will be too uncomfortable to wear.",2
302231,"Well, it's not that much support for the boobs. Might take me time to find something I ilke to wear with it. 32d. It's not holding anything in any way, so it'd purely for looks at this point! I might try washing it to see if that helps, like another reviewer mentioned.",3
870938,"5'6 160 lbs D cup. Fits great in length, and bust but elastic is a little loose. Like it might have been stretched out. Almost to big, hard to keep up. Will wear a bandeau bra under it, should be ok. Material is awesome. Very soft and moves well. I wish the elastic in waist dropped more. I have a long body, short legs. Hope to enjoy this summer.",3
54298,"If you like large purses, this one might be okay.  The interior was also black, making it difficult to find things in; and the lining was so loose it bunched up and made it even more difficult.  I have a Walther 9MM; the holster was too small for it but if I just put the gun in without the holster, swallowed it.",3
440426,"This was a nice little tie tack! The size is just right, and it looks nice. The only trouble we had is that if you use it on...let's say not you nicest of ties...it has a tendency to catch and mess up the fabric a bit. However, that may be an issue of all tie tacks, this is honestly the first and only one I have ever purchased, so I hate to rag on it too much for something that may be a widespread challenge with products like this!",4
814721,"It still fits me, but did wind up being a little too small. It's a good thing I got the xxl, because then if I hadn't, then it for sure would have been too small. I was worried it would be too big, but now I may have to buy it again in xxxl. I can still wear it though, but it's just a little tight in the stomach area. Now I can't remember if I only got extra large, but I am pretty sure I got the xxl.",4
567703,"I wear a small or medium in clothes, bought a medium, and handed this to a 10 year old. The leggings fit her. Even if you say this is Asian sizing, the medium shouldn't jump to a 10 year old! COME ON! Don't waste your money! It wasn't what was pictured either. So weird! I only didn't return because it would have been complicated to go back overseas.",1
148494,"I actually received this dress much earlier than expected. Even though it was listed as an XS, I read other reviews that mentioned it was larger than that, so I took a chance (considering the price) and ordered it anyway. I usually wear a Medium and the dress fit perfectly. It's flattering and comfortable for running errands or to wear on casual days. I received the same color as in the picture (some reviewers complained about having received a different color).",5

The pattern is so cute, but a little lost on the smaller sizes- my 15 month old wears a 6T, and each boot only has a couple of animals. We bought them mainly for the match-anything neutral colors and for his obsession with bears- luckily there's a part of a bear on one boot! Don't buy these too big, or your kid will be falling out of them- and get thick socks!",4
708491,I was worried the my iPhone 6 Plus would not fit in it with the plastic cover that I had on it. I went to local store to see if they had the same product and they did and the phone fit beautifully. It is much prettier in person then in this picture. The price from Amazon is much cheaper than where I saw it.  I have a medium sized purse and this will it fit perfectly.,5
672323,"These are slightly smaller than the lenses they replaced, but still fit well enough that they stayed within the frames without trouble. However, these got scratched almost immediately. (Within a day). We actually switched back to the original scratched lens because these replacement lenses were scratched so badly, with nothing more than a day's wear (not dropped, etc). The original lenses lasted a year of routine wear before finally getting scratched.  Not worth the price, unless your sunglasses just sit on a shelf and look pretty all the time.",2
156395,"I received the black stainless steel version.
It holds 7 cards, or 6 cards and a small amount (two bills) of folded cash and still shuts securely. Anything more than that combo will make it pop open.
The black SS is very nice. It doesn't look like one of those cheap aluminum wallets you can get at the dollar store. It does show fingerprints, but that's to be expected. The metal clasp is great too - no worries about it breaking like the plastic ones.",5
295579,"I am SO thrilled with this dress. I'm 5'10, 140 lbs and ordered a size small. I usually wear an x-small/small or a 0/2. This is a true bandage dress so i decided on the small. It fits PERFECTLY. I'll be able to wear a pair of 3-4 inch heels with it because the stretch in the dress allowed me to pull it to be longer or shorter. It looks expensive and feels very high quality. Seriously so incredibly thrilled with this. I usually have a hard time with dresses but this one is perfect. Highly recommend.",5
852668,"This is a pair of good quality glasses. This pair of sunglasses is not picky on the face shape, so it probably fits everyone. The frame is made of metal, thus it is very sturdy. The glasses come with a nice dark blue case as well. The lenses are very dark for excellent protection. I would recommend this item to my friends.",5
306714,I got this as a gift for a young girl.  I am pleased with the quality.  The gold finish is highly polished.  The stones and colors are opalescent.  The delicate colors and shine should bring a smile to any girl's heart.  The butterfly fairy is a graceful design.  The piece has weight to it.,5
486587,"Even more gorgeous coat in person, I love the lace detail and the flare. Perfect for those with a pear or hourglass figure as it slims down at the waist to compliment your figure. Feels and looks like an expensive coat, will definitely keep me warm this winter, even can repel rain. I'm 5'4 and 105 lbs, 32-22.5-35, and the XS fit perfectly.",5
497001,"This seller has awesome shirts that fit snugly but perfectly if you are going for a somewhat sexy, fitted look. The shirt is super comfortable and soft. I loved it so much that I bought all of the other designs in the sleeveless print vest top. I highly recommend this product. i absolutely love it!",5
743643,"I suppose I should expect the quality for what I paid. It's not bad, but not as thick as I had hoped. The hood is separate, and the blue plaid only goes as far as the sides of the hood to tuck into the buttons. Interior of the coat is black. No lining.",3
581783,"The picture is much better than the actual sweatshirt. The material was so cheap and thin. You can literally see through the material. I for some reason thought the dark color was navy blue, but it's black. Such a waste of money. However, I should have known the quality wouldn't be that great for the price.",1
451835,"Why does it list two colors, but they both look the same?  They are not the same.  ""Earth"" color is apparently as in dirt color, because that's the color of the hat I got.  Sent it back and ordered another one before I caught on, not that anyone bothered reading the message I included with my return.  Unfortunately, it's a frustration that has colored the whole transaction bad for me.",4
605747,"The minute I opened up the package, I fell in love with it. The material feels so nice, and the color is exactly as shown in the picture. I ordered an XL because of my chest, and although the sleeves were a bit long on my short arms, it still looked super cute because of the sleeves. There is a little bit of stretchiness but not very much. Otherwise, I'm very pleased with this top :)",5
434943,"Beautiful ring, the photo fails to show the true brilliance of this ring.  It does not look like it's CZ!  It's much prettier and richer when seeing it in person.  So glad to have found this ring on Amazon!  What an amazing deal!  Thank you!",5
877687,Great quality - especially like the snaps over the shoulder that allow for the neck to snug without having that huge fuss pulling the shirt over her head.  The color is just as represented.  Material fairly light weight.  Requires a T-shirt during winter but will be a nice spring shirt and keep the sun away.  Generous 2T,5

My only disappointment is that they didn't pay for the return postage, thats why 4 stars instead of 5.",4
410495,"This product fit snuggly, maybe a hair too snug for me right after my c-section, however I could deal with that. I couldn't deal with the fact that it was really uncomfortable where the stitching and seams where. It felt like the thread was really rough and was cutting into my skin, so hence I didn't wear it for more than 30 mins once. I wouldn't bother getting this. Instead,. I would opt for the belly bands that can go over your clothes.",1
876711,"This dress is not as chic as in the photo.
Looks cheap worn. The knotting at the side falls to the middle on the actual dress and the skirt portion is much shorter than what you'd expect from the photo.
The material is also very thin making the dress somewhat see through.",2
598997,"Cheap looking materials, studs just glued on crooked, heels hard to walk in (I say this as someone very comfortable walking in platforms and 5 inch heels regularly).

449553,"This wallet is great when you want a wallet that will hold everything.  It holds so much that it is almost a mini-purse and I actually think it would be great as a clutch.  In addition, it is very pretty - which is why it caught my eye in the first place.  It would make a lovely gift and in fact in comes packaged in a beautiful box.  I recommend this wallet.",5
109273,I bought this bcuz I was afraid the reg siz would be too small when I saw that it said it ran smal and was tight on the arms.  This plus size worked great bcuz it had a string in the back to tighten it.  The arms felt fine and I was very happy.,5
43356,I loved it was clear so could see in all directions. Loved the fact the ends are protected by plastic ball covers to prevent eye poking. Opens and closes without biting fingers! Only thing I don't like is it doesn't fold down to fit into back packs. But a very good children's umbrella.,4
721436,"The jacket arrived much sooner  then I expected since  it  did come from China.  I got the extra large which fits
like a medium on me but  its  not  too tight.  I like the light weight material.  I  would definitely hand wash in cold
water.  I like the jacket very much.",4
206399,"The fit of this shirt is too small, even though I owned a lot of slim fitting shirts. I am keeping the shirt, just in case I find someone to give this too.

377383,"Love how this shirt hangs! Depending on the color you get, this shirt can be fun and care free, or very business casual! Love the versatility, and of course being comfortable at the same time! Fits as expected and I just love it. Wouldn't mind owning it in a few colors!

I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.",5
864234,This is an 8 pack and all of the black ones are not the same size as the rest.  They feel like XL and the 6 other pairs are perfect XXL. There was also 4 white pairs and this was supposed to be a color pack. The picture in amazon did not show any white pairs. Very disappointed in this pack.,1
464055,"I ordered this fearing that like all pendants the chain would be to small to wear.  Not at all the chain is a very good quality and the sandal pendant is beautiful.  I got this item early and in a beautiful gift box!  I am very impressed with ""Diamond Harmony"".  They shipped my item very quickly and I received it amazingly quick!  Thank you!",5
656954,"This was perfect for a few day trip on the beach for my one year old daughter! Love how loose and cool the fabric is but hood easily stays on without getting in her way as she played. There are bottoms to create a sleeve slot of sorts that kept her arms covered. Wonderful product! If your looking for a great replacement option for skin guards this is it, or something to put them in after they get wet and are ready to play in the sand. So glad I found it.",5
456397,This case is so brilliantly designed! Everything about it is thoughtful and cleverl. It's soft and fits anywhere including your pocket. The inverted tray holds the pills so you are not having them in your hand and the fact that it is one unit which opens and closes with no cap gives me pleasure every time I use it. I give them as presents to everyone.,5
705464,"I bought these as a gift for my boyfriend for Christmas, they're excellent quality! Very soft leather, and very soft insides. He wears them when driving. I definitely wouldn't be rough with them - no snowball fights - but they held up for the whole winter and they have worn very well. They don't crack like some cheaper leather gloves do, and they're still soft and smooth.",4
874145,I received my earrings by the date expected . They were very securely packaged.  I've read some reviews saying they weren't 1 carat.  But what was ordered was 1 carat total weight.  That's what ctw stands for.  They are nice and clear and s good buy.,5

389937,"Although I find no fault with this underwear, I'm not sure I can say ""I love it"" when thinking of underwear.  However, this underwear does its job by doing what it is supposed to do.  Other brands I've tried, and they are not ""discount"" brands, stretch around the legs almost as soon as I put them on.  The result is discomfort and having to pull up my underwear out of sight of others.  This underwear is excellent at retaining its elasticity and it is also very comfortable.  Good buy for the money.",4
280897,It gets 2 stars for how cute it is and the speed of delivery. But wow if you'd is an xl..i must be a xxxxl. Its tiny. Rally disappointed and won't be able to wear it. Ill give it to someone with no boobs and a tiny waist. Material is nice. Colors are bright like the photo but not true to size at least for me. And i even ordered a size up!!,2
837454,"This was an expensive costume and it arrived with the zipper broken: missing teeth and stuck at the top. The zipper pull was up (meaning it should have been zipped) but the zipper was not closed. I took it down to the bottom, where it is supposed to start, and it would not seal. I am extremely disappointed because now I have to pay to ship this stupid useless thing back in order to get a refund. Buyer beware!",1
120058,we bought a 24 month size for our 6 month old and it has fit for about 2 months and I'm already shopping for another one because these are  cutting his circulation off.  like idk why they make the leg holes so tight but I'm sure I'm not the only one with a baby who has chunky thighs.  this brand is awful for this and I'm going to go with a different one.  it's made well I guess but that doesn't matter if you can't use it for long.,1
201151,"Gosh darn this thing is cute. I'm normally a medium so I ordered a large and fit perfectly! Please note that the skirt is supposed to sit at your waist so if you're having problems with it being too tight it's because you need to pull it up to your natural waist. The colors are vivid and the skirt length rests roughly an inch below my bum. The top is slightly see-through but not too much so, I just wear a white bra with it.",5

I ordered a medium, i'm 5'5 with an athletic swimmer's body and it fit perfectly.

I'll be wearing this to many convention and halloween parties. Or whenever.",5

I usually wear an XL and I ordered an XL and it's nice and loose, just like I wanted.",5
1946,Great quality. Very large. I bought for my 4 year old who had a big head and it is very roomy. It even fit the adult's heads. My only complaint is that the buttons for the shield and microphone are in the outside of the helmet and hard for my little guy to find himself.,3

They're made kind of cheaply, the bows are only glued on.  However, they won't take me through the dead of winter as I don't believe they're intended for very cold weather anyway, so I guess I have to look for another, better made pair..

I would not purchase this again nor would I reccommend it.",2

I am someone who does not wear glasses often but with these I hardly take them off. The only problem I had was placing in my own lenses but that could easily be done by a professional.

179241,I've been looking for sunglasses that fit over my glasses for a while now.  I saw some online that were $60.00 - $70.00 but did not think they were worth the money.  Mostly need them for in the car or for outside during a bright day.  They look just like the picture and the handy bag works well.  Thanks for a great product!,5
67930,"This purse was exactly what I was looking for! At Once, it is beautiful, utilitarian, and well made. I love this purse!  The only thing I would change, is that I would add a deeper, zippered pocket on the front of the purse, for cell phone, lipsticks, etc. Things I need to access quickly!  And I would add a couple more compartments within the purse too!  But other than those suggestions, THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT!

113512,It is nice to have a costume that is quick and easy to put together with plain clothes for emergencies. This will be a good go-to option. It will also work for volunteer science visits to my daughter's class during butterfly lessons! Quality is what you'd expect for the price.,3
269122,"Awesome purse! The canvas is a good heavy duty quality. The bag is really roomy, lots of pockets and zipper compartments. I love that it comes with a long detachable strap, plus the other 2 handle lengths that are on the bag. Great bag and I'll definitely buy other colors.",5

I was a bit apprehensive about the red derby but I figured I get it and if it looked too girlish I would pass it on to one of my daughters.
It looks pretty hip if you are into colored hats as I am but it was pretty cool except it runs big but they sent strip sizers for each hat just in case so I used one in this one.
Check them out e4Hats",4
233322,"I got the wrong colors with my order. I ordered the Beige/white colors for a friend and when the package arrived it was light blue and pink. Kind of disappointed, she was too nice to let me return them for the proper colors, but the hats themselves are great quality.",3

 I received this product on a promotional discount for my honest review and they are 100% my own opinions. I received no compensation for this review and I am not required to give a positive review. I am also not associated with the seller in any way.",5
37201,"We like the quality and lightness of this hat, but size 12M is too small for my 7 months old son. I knew he is much bigger than the average, so I thought 12M will be just right, but unfortunately the hat leaves a red mark around his had just after a few minutes of wearing it.",3
613497,"This is really cute and fits surprisingly well.  Personally I wouldn't mind if it was a smidge tighter.  I might try a belt?  It's also made really well!  I can't believed how cheap it was! I haven't worn it out yet.
I bet my mom will get a kick out of it :)",5
744223,"I was excited to receive this feminine night outfit but when it came and I took it out the package my first thought was ""this feels like it could rip easily"" and then when I put it on it was way too big. I ordered a medium and at 150 pounds that isn't a normal occurrence. I returned it in the end",2
875796,"Bought the one size fits all and it was really long. Only thing I needed to get altered was the length and I cut the slit higher. I'm usually a US size small.

The dress is very comfortable. The material is light and stretchy. Got lots of compliments. And it's such a good price too!",5

568237,"Very nice earrings for the price.  IGI card says 1ct to 1 1/4 ct...Id like to get them appraised to see what size they really are.  The color is great...no yellow.  And the clarity...perfect...I see no inclusions even though these are minimum I2 clarity.  Again, will get them appraised to see the truth.  I really wanted 1.5 ct total weight but those are at least 500-1000 more for a pair.  I'll stick with these",5
877900,"I should have listened to the other reviews, because my zipper broke first time trying it on. The material is great. I ordered a medium, even though I usually wear small, and it fit very well. Will be returning it and will not purchasing another one due to everyone having malfunctions.",3
88461,"I really loved this dress! I'm a pretty large girl, usually fit a size L/XL.
I got the M/L and it was pretty loose, but I knew that if I got the S/M, it wouldn't fit well, so I didn't exchange it.
I'm also 5'3 and the dress was too long for my liking. It came down a tiny bit past my knees. I wouldn't have worn it if I couldn't shorten it, but my mom shortened it up for me. Super cute now!",4
438348,Purchased these for my wife for Christmas.  We both like the idea of the bezel setting. The package came with an appraisal which is now in the safe deposit box.  She was very happy and quite surprised to get the 3 carat size.  It was also nice that the price was reduced by $160 as a promotional item.  She wears them everywhere.,5
429868,"This is a great dress. It fit perfectly. The size is as described and as expected. I am 5""10.75 and bought a size 6 according to the size chart - I am usually a 4 and I like the fact that it was just long enough. The quality is good. I am wearing it to a beach wedding and its looks perfect for that. I would have given 5 stars except that the zipper was a little difficult to pull up.",4
25435,"I buy regular width shoes, and these are too wide towards the rear part of the shoe. You can only trim the front of these of inserts not the rear. On many normal width dress shoes these inserts will rest on the walls of the shoe and stretch it out. Besides for dimension issues these provide excellent support for my low arch and also provide nice cushioning throughout.",4
440010,"Went by other postings and ordered one size up (large). Bottoms fit great, top a little loose but workable.  I'm a C cup, but if you are larger might not provide the support you are looking for. Overall I am pleased. I ordered the black one with the slimming white stripes.",4

Id say buy it for you and your friends. Its awesome (:",4

661319,It wore great at first with a nice fit.  Two weeks later the metal buckle came apart from the band and I was so thankful I did not loose my watch.  I found the missing piece on the floor the next day.  I cannot but it back together and I was disappointed that it did not stand up to everyday wear.,2

405819,"I gave this as a gift to my wife last Christmas, and it is as described, and even nicer looking than the picture. My wife loves the color of the coral contrasting with the silver. It seems very durable and goes well with lots of her work clothes. Not a long necklace, it's more like a choker. Definitely a good buy and great gift, especially if you have to get back in her good graces.",5
412538,I got this yesterday and I love it. It was packed in a plastic zip lock bag. But the beads are really nice. I had ordered a bracelet from another vendor but their beads had nasty holes in them and black spots. I can tell the difference between the two products and I really feel that this piece of jewelry was really worth the money. It looks nice with vibrant colors and feels heavy too. Overall really nice product. Would recommend it to others.,5

I felt a difference immediately in my back. My mid section has felt a little ""gumby-ish"" since giving birth and the belly bandit has given me a lot of support back. Glad I purchased.",5
484519,One was too big so I couldn't use it. The other 2 were size 8 so I was glad an error had been made in the size. I love the survival bracelets. I had been searching for them since I purchased one at the Air Force base. None of the others that I found were exactly the same until I found these. I will definitely be re-ordering more.,4

I shall be purchasing a few more of these as well as suggesting them to a few websites I visit.",5

It was a little dissapointing but the harm was undone.",2

Actually, I'd be a little concerned about them potentially rolling/falling down!",5
585673,"Beautiful design for a holiday shirt. The shirt seems to be made of good-quality, medium/heavy weight cotton. I was expecting something flimsy or cheap, but was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the shirt.

The seller initially sent me a kids-sized shirt. The seller responded to my email, and, without question, very quickly and immediately sent out the correct shirt along with a return package for the incorrect shirt.",5
358589,These are the best infant gloves hands down! I like that they come in cute colors too. A bit on the expensive side but worth it in my opinion. They don't slip off like the popular generic ones that you receive during your baby shower. Return those gloves and buy these instead!,5
14302,"These orthotics were recommended by my podiatrist, specifically the blue ones. I have 2 pairs now, and I highly recommend them. I not only have plantar fasciitis, but also one flat foot, and one not. They did not cure my PF, but certainly helped with the pain. I work in a hospital, and am on my feet all day. These pinnacle inserts have made my feet a lot happier.",5
225960,"Perfect fit and great quality; worth the long wait for the delivery! Definitely looks more expensive than the $20 or so that I paid. The fabric is on the heavy side, which gives the skirt a great flared shape that holds up and looks very flattering. Tempted to buy another color.
I'm 27-28"" at the waist (US size 4-6) and the Medium fits perfectly.",5
210830,Bought these for my girlfriend. They look and feel great. I bought them medium as she is a medium but I think I could have gone with a small as they are a little big. Material is great and the quality seems good. You may have to fold the waist a little bit as they are long.,4
249730,"The big question will be how long it lasts, but for right now, I'm very pleased with this. Looks exactly as advertised, and I'm very hopeful that the leather band will last longer than ballistic nylon, which tends to break down over time, causing the loops to fray and the watch to loosen.",4
405669,"I bought this as a temporary replacement for my wedding ring. I have rubies on my original ring and that is a main factor in buying this ring to replace it.  I was very disappointed to open the ring and see PINK Rubies.  The ring itself is very comfortable and decent looking.  It also seems true to size.  But it is pink, not red as expected. ;-)",2
760686,"I love this! Never worn a piece of jewelry like this, but I'm so glad I decided to give it a try. It's definitely a statement piece and is so light weight you can hardly tell that it's on. For the people who maybe hesitant on the size don't be. It's not too big where it would be considered bulky. My mom at 65 even loves it and is going to order one for herself.",5
865663,"Sadly I loved it when it arrived.  The fabric and color was great.  I also reviewed size chart before placing order to assure proper fitting. It was a 3 Large. And though I have lost weight I could not get this over my head. So, great product but they obviously in China where it was made mislabeled the size. I am now anxious ordering anymore of these as I have lost trust.",1
593418,"Purse is lovely. I bought this to go with the matching shoes and I'm glad I did. The only minor criticism I have is that I wish a shorter chain was included to use the bag as a hand bag and not just a shoulder bag to be hands free. Some of my cruise clothes are lace and I'm afraid the shoulder chain might snag the shoulders of my clothes. Other than that, I love it. Highly recommend.",5
774699,Love love love this swimsuit!! I am tall and heavier chested but narrow in the hips. I got a size large which fits perfect on top. The bottoms were small even though they were also a large and skimpier than I normally wear but the top alone is worth the price of this swim suit!,5
138889,"I liked it until it broke exactly two weeks after I got it. The toothed clasp fell off in the snow and disappeared, and now the belt won't latch. It was pretty, but perhaps a bit too flimsy for daily use. It was also difficult to unlatch the belt. The release mechanism got stuck sometimes, and it would take several tries to undo the belt around my waist. I returned the belt.",2
420263,"I ordered a locket a month ago, and just recently got an email about another delay.
Unless this necklace proves to be worth replacement presents for Christmas and a missed birthday, I would suggest NOT ordering any of the products from this company. They have offered nothing for their horrible service except empty promises and more delays.",1

365817,"Unfortunately, i didn't receive a belt with the Hermes stamp nor did I receive the hole puncher many spoke about. Nonetheless, I ordered the tan with gold H. Looks like the real deal. I ordered the smallest size and I could use another hole in the belt. My waist is 23in.",4

687998,"Can't complain too much because the dress was very inexpensive.  The material is pretty, but it is cut slim, not flowy as it is in the picture, and the bust is cut very small.  I ordered a size larger and the bust was still tight.  It is not a fit and flare; I would call it more of a column.  What I've decided to do is to cut off the bottom and make it into a skirt as the print is very pretty.",3
763231,"I like fun & funky and these shiny pants are the epitome. Like other reviewers noted, these leggings don't have much stretch/give, if you get just the right size they can make your night. You'll get plenty of attention and plenty of people that just need to feel what such a shiny fabric feels like.",4

I was Surprised that I recieved 3 Life Tree Pendant Neclaces in 1 order....it says 3 pieces but I did not know they meant 3 individual Neclaces for such a great price!!!

They deserve 5 Stars and then some!! :))))",5

641539,"Love these shorts!!! To the reviewers that state these shorts fit like ""bike"" shorts, if you read the item description it states that these are like dressy ""bike"" shorts... They truly are comfy and stylish to say the least. I am very happy with my purchase! Thanks and GOD Bless!!",5
380469,This fits way more stuff than the usual bags - I think because of the flat bottom.  This was my second try - the first one I got on amazon looked nicer but the zipper was positioned in such a way that there were openings on both sides (why?!).  I am purchasing another one for the husband today.,5
631785,"Love this bag! It is very spacious inside, so much so that I can put my umbrella in it (small expandable one). Quality is top notch and smells like quality leather. The lengthy strap looks cheap but I did not intend on using it anyway. I've received many compliments on it already.",5
89670,"In less than a week, the strap between the hook and the case came loose from the case on one side.  I only ordered the hard case one to use until the soft case ones arrived, it didn't.  Wear on hip connected to bel loop which is probably why strap broke loose since the case lis quite bulky.",1
73310,"At first I thought this was a beautiful necklace.  Over time it became a bit dull and when I used silver polish on it, it turned a rusty red black color.  Obviously not silver plated.  I have only had it for about six weeks and I can't even wear it.  :(
Not satisfied at all with this product.",1
2453,"my husband purchased a pair of these shoes a few years ago, and wears them almost every day to work.  earlier this year he was moping around the house wishing he had bought 2 or 3 pairs.  we hopped on line, and amazon to the rescue!  great shoes, great price, great look too!",5
879329,"They are very soft, won't be wearing for a while though, has been so hot here! Will wait till the temperature drops a little but look forward to wearing them as they are very soft and have a little weight to them so will be perfect for the fall weather.",5
113545,They fit an adult woman just fine using the elastic hooks on each end when arms are fully extended.  It also has a nice black back piece where the wings come together. They flutter beautifully in the wind and are comfortable to wear and move around in for many hours.  The buyer should know the full color is only on the back side. But the color is vibrant enough to show through.,5
341363,"I purchased these after purchasing some ultra soft leggings made by the same company, which are great! Hoping for the same good quality I purchased these and within 1 day and had runs in 2 pair. I'm scared to even try a 3rd pair, as I fear they will run too. Both pairs ran at the waist. Ugh!!",1
298596,"Well built and very nice product.  Only complaints are that the wallet is slightly too large, and the credit cards aren't 'snug' in the compartment, and the cover doesn't completely close on this wallet.  So, if you have this in your shirt pocket, the cards easily spill out.  I have to keep the cards secure, and the cover completely closed, by wrapping a rubber band around the wallet.",3
256118,"The material was okay but it didn't fit me properly, I wear a size large and when I tried the skirt on the band was extremely tight and everything else was super loose. Not what I expected. However I am giving 2 stars because the material is soft and I did like that.",2
315953,"These are super-unflattering if you have violin hips / hip dips.  The waistband its right as my upper hip bone is widening, meaning it gives me an optical muffin top.  Pants need to be at least mid-rise if you have this body type, and sadly PajamaJeans seem to all be low rise.",2
757408,"Love it!  Read the reviews and get the right size.  I am 5' 6"" and wear a 10-12 in US Womens.  It says that makes me a 3XL but don't get caught up on the size.  You want it to fit correctly.  These are the best swim suites!  Not a mom one piece but not a revealing bikini for a family vacation.  LOADS of compliments!",5
240906,I got this ring after seeing my husband's tungsten ring still looking like new after working in home repair. I wanted a simple band to wear to work. The ring has some weight to it but is not heavy. It's very shiny and is much lighter in color than my husband's ring. It is not exactly silver but isn't dark gray either. I'm happy with this purchase.,5
511215,"Hard to see on the model, but the waist is narrow and not at all adjustable, so the shirt doesn't hang straight.  It feels odd putting it on, almost as if there should be a zipper, because that waist doesn't want to go over your shoulders easily.  Once on, it causes the blouse to sit at an unnatural height and to not really drape well.  I bought a size bigger than I normally wear, and while the blouse fits okay, that waist bugs me enough that I doubt I'll ever wear it.",3
45847,"This product is amazing! My daughter ordered these to wear with her Day of the Dead consume & it was perfect! The fit is great, the material/quality is excellent & it really does glow in the dark. Definitely worth the price & we would order another in a heartbeat if needed.",5
523237,Great buy! I was hesitant to purchase since I typically like to feel and try on all my swimsuits.  Based on the reviews I ordered one size up - I'm usually a small [height 5'5 / weight 120lbs / bra 34B] and I ordered a medium and it fits well.  The swimsuit has the bandage feel to it and seems like good quality.  I'm currently looking to purchase another in a different color :),5
420434,"A gift for my husband for christmas. For some reason, these are his favorite gloves to use for bike rides in the winter when it is very cold out. The gloves breathe and wick sweat to keep his hands warm and dry. He prefers these to much more expensive gloves specifically designed for biking.",5
790782,"When I first got the dress I thought it would be too long it's not it stops right at my ankles. The dress fit perfect on me I got a medium its not to big or small, I can move in it without a problem. The dress pretty stretchy too so its comfortable. I got compliments on how nice the dress is. (Apologize about the face, wanted to take the picture quick).",5
358391,These little mitts are the BEES KNEES. They are super cute and soft and I love that the velcro keeps them attached to your babys hands to keep them warm and so they cant scratch their little face. These are a MUST for a winter baby! I also love the little gender neutral designs on these mitts.,5
712161,You get what you pay for. The watch is fairly large and difficult to adjust. I ended up prying the segments off then banging the ends back on to get it to fit my small wrists. Those watch adjustment kits won't work on this as the pins are a part of the watch and don't come loose.,3
865359,"My son loves george pig, so when I saw this shirt, I just had to have it. While the shirt is really cute, super soft and a new favorite of my son's, its not red. The stripes are pink. Very pink. Not even close to red. The description really needs to be changed. I could care less if its pink, and frankly my son doesn't care either, but when you expect a certain color and then it doesn't even come close to that color, its a bummer. Great quality shirt though!",3
21125,"I got this to take my three month old to the beach in Florida. I love how well it covered his face, head and neck. The drawstring around the head and the tie string under the chin make for a very adjustable fit! Don't forget baby still needs to be in shade with sunscreen because the light will reflect off the sand and water!",5
363613,"This swimsuit is super cute.  The fushia color is vibrant and bright and the quality of the material is thick and will hold up for years.  The only problem I had with this suit is my short torso and the middle strap, so I had to shorten it.  Otherwise it's a keeper!  Love it and can't wait to wear it on my upcoming trip to Jamaica.",5
377177,"The headband is kinda a let down. It's so tiny, not st all what I expected. The ring is pretty cool but it falls off my finger, it's not adjustable. (it's probably a size 7) And the necklace is pretty small for my neck as well. (I'm 5'9 & slender) So if this product is for a baby ninja with monster hands....go for it. This product wil be getting returned.",3
725127,I really like this blouse. The quality was better than expected and the length is perfect.  I could wear with a pair of spandex.  The only reason I gave this product 4 stars is because I have a bear shaped body. Otherwise it will be 5 stars. I recommend this product 100%.,4
53216,"I have been looking for a hat with big brim for my 6 month old. He has large head circumference so I bought infant 12 month -18 month for him. It fits perfectly.

The material feels soft. The only downside is it's no that breathable. Other than that, I am happy with the purchase.",5
291120,"I love it I would maybe go down another size.
I am a large I purchased a medium but due to the type if fabric its made from it loses its shape and stretched easy but you get what you pay for! for the price I would certainly recommend, its super cute on and the details on the skirt is super cute.",5
321069,Great key fob cover! I can store extras on the opposite side. I don't mind the larger size as I can easily find it in my purse & won't forget it if I carry it alone. Great large clip so I can clip it to my belt loop or bag.,5
837053,"Bought these for my wife.  She is a fan, they fit well and look cute on her.  They hold their place well which was my only concern.  We washed them once and they held up well too, looks like they will last.  I think these are a nice unique pair of panties to surprise your partner with and would recommend them, especially for the price.",5
16111,"I don't know what I expected for the price. The look is cheap, as is the material. Thank goodness I sew, because I will just take off the tzit tzit and prayer to add it to some white silk I already own. The talit is also fairly small. This is not for a person taller than 5'5"" or so.",1
582995,Completely too small.  Ridiculous.  The tag had no size on it except that someone wrote the letter L on it. I guess that's their way of being able to say it's a large and won't replace it or refund it.  We gave these away to the 10 year old neighbor girl.,1
142745,"I really like this jacket.  It is super warm and super comfortable.  My only qualm is that it is small.  I ordered a size larger than I normally do, but would go 2 sizes larger than normal in the future.  When I first got it, the zipper was hard to move.  However, after some use, the zipper doesn't give me any issues anymore.",4
302420,"O.K. if you are a an A cup.  Seems cheaply made.  Don't let the ""Free Returns""  fool you.  They will argue with you about returning this item offering a ""partial return"" or ""why don't you give it as a gift"".  Who gives a bra as a gift??  Now I'm stuck with a bra that doesn't fit.

868040,"These were not designed for nursing. There is no clasp to take the top down or area to pull it up. This is simply a spaghetti strap shirt with awkward, loose padding at the breast. An awkward fitting shirt at that, and not one I would wear for any purposes, particularly not breastfeeding.",1
691627,I requested a return and because of having to ship from somewhere overseas they offered a 20% perfect refund. It was not just small it was very small. I am a 3xl and this fits my sister who wears a size 12. Very disappointing. And to boot I did not get the any refund at all.,1
64501,"Super cute Mickey design but not best quality as far as print. Some are perfect, others have some flaws on where design was transferred to fabric. Also these get washed a lot due to accidents and some of the design comes off a few of them.  My son could care less though and LOVES his big boy pants. He's on the tiny side so at 3 they are big on him, but comfy.  Easy to slide on and stay on till he wants to pull them down. Lots of colors and Mickeys.",4

These cat eye sunglasses are cute, the frames are sturdy, and the lens are not distorted.  I am so impressed that I will order the black pair too. Thanks. Scott and Amy",4
406466,"Shoe was very cute, and arrived with a reusable shopping bag. I feel the shoe length was true to size, however the shoe width ran a bit narrow. My 14 month old daughter has big feet (length wise) but they are fairly skinny. They still fit but it is a bit of a challenge to get them on, and i had to stretch out the strap to get them on. Cutest shoes. I ordered a size five. thanks",4

557044,"This are a beautiful 3-piece set, and the ""silver"" is very shiny.  The bracelet and earrings are stunning, however, the chain for the necklace is extremely thin and looks like it's going to change colors at any moment.  I would make another purchase from this company because I saw some other pieces I (think) I like.  However, I doubt seriously if I will purchase this particular set in another color.",3
489024,We are looking for more but can't seem to find any in the next size or the sizing descriptions are strange and inconsistent. If you have a small baby I would recommend buying a couple pairs and anticipating they will fit in the future. We will stock up on these for round two. They are protective but not rigid so babies can learn to walk and balance properly.,5
185783,"For $8, this is a great clutch. The quality is about what you'd expect for the price, though. I bought this to use at a wedding and a couple other special events this summer, so I won't be using it a ton. If you're planning on using it a lot, I'd recommend getting something of better quality.",4

The color is really nice and as the picture. The finishing of the blouse is kinda of rough specially on the sleeve, I think I will have to wear it with a jacket in order to cover the rough stitches.",2
177625,I've worn these a few times already and they are the most comfortable pants. I especially love them for traveling on a plane. I bought these specifically to wear in humid weather and I felt cool and didn't feel sticky. The band around the waist has gotten a bit loose so I can't hold my cellphone in the front pocket anymore without the front drooping. The colors are still great and I plan to wear these to my upcoming trip in august to Taiwan.,4

Beware if you have sensitive skin. :(",1

It fits like a glove! I can't believe how much prettier it is in person. The quality is good and It's such a unique dress! Love it!",5
341584,"These are truly a one size fits! I am 5'9"" size 14 so usually have trouble with the one size clothing items. These leggings are extremely stretchy but still not see through. They're very comfortable and do not itch at all. The colors are a bit more vibrant than I originally expected but I did buy a few more individual pairs as well because I love them so much! Great for the money",5
195897,I love this shirt & have gotten several compliments. It's a little big but still looks ok. I could've got a size smaller than I usually wear & it would've fit. The colors are bright & the pattern is like in the picture. I knew shipping would take a while but i received it about a week early.,5
177225,"I normally wear. Medium but ordered large as other reviews said it runs small. Fits me everywhere but the chest. Technically it fits there but there could easily be a wardrobe malfunction. If you are smaller breasted (I'm 34d) it will probably be fine. Super sexy, but I don't know that I'll be wearing it in public.",4

Kinda wish they somehow reinforced the button that holds the top part in the sole because that's where they seem to break on me always. I had my last pair a little over a year. Hated throwing them out since the soles still had good life left. but no way to fix, unless someone has any ideas?",5
436543,I got these for my 5 yr olds Halloween outfit. They go over her knees and are more like bell bottoms than the straight leg I wanted. I paid more for these than the other pink boot covers I saw online because the image made it look more fuzzier and more straight leg. But when I gotten they looked like the pictures of the other boot covers I passed up.,3
694187,Don't waste your money. First it took a month in half to come. When it finally came it was the wrong size and it does not run large. These dresses are junior sizes. I am a 12 they sent an 18 and this skirt is skin tight and short. I order the brown skirt. It doesn't appear like the picture. I'm disappointed.,1
311178,"I ordered this based off of reviews and I was disappointed. As many stated, it does run somewhat large, but for me, it was extremely baggy in the bust area. I thought I would like the silver buttons down the side, but something just wasn't vibing right with the whole look of the top. I'm returning it.",2

It was suppose to ship May 6th, but I received the package by April 30th! So that is a BIG plus. However, the sizing wasn't alright. The top was a bit too big for me, which is why I'm returning it.",3
92380,"This is huge and much larger than I anticipated and hangs in my closet on a rod that is intended for jackets and almost touches the floor.  But the good part is that it holds a tremendous amount of watches, bracelets, necklaces, earrings and rings. It appears to be very well-made and the nice part is that everything is held in by a zipper that goes from left to right to open in from right to left to close so you don't have to worry about your jewelry falling on the floor.",5
798466,The only reason im giving it one star is because i have to. The dress.... Where do i start the hook on the neck is broken. And why ask if you want WHITE OR IVORY? WHEN THE DRESS IS MIXED WHITH BOTH. I ordered white and the whole underneath slip boob part its all i ivory. Looks terrable when it shows threw the dress. And there was a small tear in the boob part.  The whole underneath looks like someone had a bad spray tan snd it rubbed off. Ugh never again its on its way back.,1
413688,"This was a very attractive bracelet in my opinion but upon arrival I found it to be too small to fit the average wrist. I am currently looking for someone slender enough who can enjoy it. It was disappointing but having it in possesion was the focal point. However, I am afraid to order any other bracelets for this reason.",3
220057,"This product is great, I love the way it looks ad it was very inexpensive which I appreciate, but it's so heavy! I wore it all day and my neck started feeling sore halfway through the day.

676097,"I am 5'6"" and wears a size small. the width fits fine, but the pants and sleeves are bit too short. Not like what you see in the picture. I don't mind the sleeves being a little shorter, but the pants are almost capri length. It would be perfect if it's 3 inches longer so it can be angle length. With all that said, it's still very comfortable and good quality. I would buy it again if they make them a bit longer because cotton tends to shrink a little in the wash.",3
132029,"I'm 5'2 112 lbs bought a size x small and it fits perfectly just like the model. My only problem is that I have the pink one too that I bought a year ago and love it because it's thick. With this one, the fabric is different and thinner. It's not see thru but I was expecting that it would be the same fabric as the pink one. Or i don't know, maybe it's a copy??",4

429596,"The fabric is soft but thin. The length hits at a weird place, not like in the picture, but right at the crease of my knee. I'm 5 foot two, I thought they would be below my knees like the picture.  I like the color. I'd send them back, but they weren't that much to begin with.",3
732144,"Its decent, the material is a little thin and feels somewhat like waterproof attire even though its not. Kind of hard to explain. My boyfriend said he will have to walk around sucking in his belly all day because its a little snug.  Def have to order a size or two up.  Its worth it for 20 bucks but I don't know how many uses we will get out of it.",3
703388,"Great shades. Kinda mad I paid 75 more in a brick and mortar store, but hey - at least I got to try em on first. I have the gun metal mirror style shades. No one can see your eyes (great for the beach!) only wish they were slightly darker. Also, not polarized which isn't bad if you're on your phone a lot. They look great and sit well on my face. Would recommend!",4
701279,"I used to wear size 2 and I bought sixe S.
It fits great. The fabric is very soft and comfy especially daily life and work out.
Also the wide waistband gives me tight feeling and control my stomach all the time. I definitely recommend this item to my friends !! Love it!!",5
312400,It's hard to find a lightweight athletic shoe with a wide toe box. This shoe has that. I am happy with the support for walking and everyday wear. I wouldn't run in them. Now I just have to stock up on as many pair as I can afford before Nike discontinues them :). Don't you hate when that happens?,5
353279,"I put them on as soon as they arrived and 4 hours later they are still tied!  Great replacement for the nylon laces that never stayed tied, period.
Thickness is uniform the entire length of 72 inches.  As I was ordering for work shoes and not boots the 72 inches was ""overkill"".  I cut one lace in half; this fit perfectly for the shoes.  I now actually have 2 pair of black laces.  Also, they are black thru & thru as the dye is not surface only.  Fine quality if you ask me.",5
717116,"I absolutely love these! They have a solid bottom and I sprayed my daughters with camp dry so they don't get ruined with any rain cus my Lil one insists on wearing them all over. When they are on they look like regular moccasin shoes and are very well made. I was really surprised in how durable these are for being ""slipper shoes"". Usually she wants really sparkled shoes then a lot of the sparkles end up falling off and they have spots or just look dull. Not these shoes, the sparkles have stayed on and they still look great.",5
362976,Tank top does not appear as in the picture. It is much more casual looking than expected. I was looking for a razorback tank that was slightly dressed up for dinners out or under a work blazer but this was not what I was looking for. The straps appear cut not seamed and fits very loosely giving the top somewhat of a frumpy look.,3
842417,"OMG I LOVE this dress! Looks exactly like the picture and hugs my curves perfectly my boobs were just a tad too big so I will leave the top button open but it still looks absolutely amazing. Nice quality, no cheaply made. Gonna get another style love it so much.",5
710202,"I actually love this dress. I got the black, long sleeve one of the designs, and it's freaking adorable. Was going to use it for Thanksgiving but I thought it was way too short, so I'll save it for when I go party downtown. It's made out of a stretchy material... I don't know what kind of material though. It's like... not swimsuit, but also not spandex. I don't know. I like it though.",4
184846,"Normally I do not like to review, but this time I must, The purse looks great the canvas is wonderful and the color just what I want, but the quality of the zippers is so bad that after the second usage none of the zippers work.  The quality of the zipper  is so poor that I do not think you can find a cheaper and poorly made nylon zipper even if you very hard. Very disappointed..",2
451384,"Nice looking shirt for the price, fits well everywhere else except the length. It hits past mid thigh on an average sized 5.5 year old who is about 44 lbs and 43 inches height. Small would fit a 5 or 6 year old, but make sure he is tall or else accept this as a long tee shirt. If you tuck in your kids shirts that would solve the problem.",4
11590,These insoles are to aggressive for my arch. I wore these in my work shoes and by the forth day they would  irritate my feet . These probably would work great if I had planter fasciitis  so I had to remove  these and I'll have Dr. Scholls in my shoes,1
52805,"Love this hat! Material is breathable for hot days and dries quickly. I have tried a few other hats, but this is the widest brim I have found. Provides full coverage of my 8 month old baby's face, even when directly facing sun. I ordered a size up (9-18 mo) to get longer use from this hat. Although a bit roomy, the adjustable toogle allows me to adjust to his size and works well. I am also very happy with the neutral gray color.",5
666057,"This back pack looks amazing. However...the one seam is coming apart after a couple of weeks of light use. The type of material the lining is made out of has to be rolled under before it is sewn.  It was not, so the material is fraying and the seam is coming apart. My son loves it...I am disappointed.",2
701744,"Super soft and comfy, fits as expected on legs and calves with a bit of extra room at the toes. Still, I LOVE these for cool days, they're not too snug and are great for lazy days, winter evenings, NOT for formal evenings, but would look good slightly slouched with some tall boots.
I would order these again- and recommend getting an extra pair if you have a daughter, she snagged one of mine!",5
537682,"Droopy crotch!  Why?  What woman needs that much room in the crotch area?  These would be perfect if not for that issue.  I am altering them myself rather than returning them, because I have that ability.  If you are not handy with sewing don't waste your money on these.",3
397573,"You know your feet the best, but for me, these were hard to break in and when they did, the arch wasn't in the right place. They were never the right shape for my feet, making them look shorter than they really are. That made it harder to get nice lines. The plie II's (capezio) worked better for me, but these might do the trick for you and they're quite a bit cheaper. These are great if you have a wider toe and a strong arch.",3
213393,"I love the dress! I got it right in time, the fabric feels very nice and it fits perfectly, although it is a bit tight around the arms (but it is okay). But other than that, it is perfect and I am looking forward to the big day in it!",5
392343,"I was very worried about the size of the bodysuit because I am normally small and read the reviews and some people were saying it was too baggy. This bodysuit is probably the best fitting I've ever had. The mesh is so soft and the sizing it PERFECT. The buttons are very comfy and it does not ride up, I suggest to anyone looking for a great quality product.",5
520289,I loved this sweater. The colors are very nice and it fits great. It got lost in the mail so it was a little late but it was worth the wait.

803246,"I am 5""4' 193 lbs size 38 C boobs and this shirt is absolutely cute over a tank top or a bathing suit but I do have to say if you're boobs are any bigger than mine I wouldn't recommend unless you are going for a under boob effect. Other than that it is a comfy material and adorable.",4
25442,Very comfortable! Was looking for something similar to Superfeet without the higher price and I think I have found it. Working on my feet 8 hours a day destroys my shoes and insoles quick so I will be coming back for these when this pair can take no more abuse.,5
518911,"I ordered these the day I gauged my ears to a size zero. They came in about a week earlier than the estimated delivery day. I didn't think I was going to be able to get them in, since I had stretched my ears so recently, but they slid right through and they are comfortable as ever!! They're super cute, too!!",5
437358,I work as a splicer and was looking for something to help keep my hands warm as well as being able to do my work without having to take my gloves off these are great. My only issue is even for a mans small which is what I usually get me in gloves they are still a little big on my hands.,4
177606,"These cost more than the $17 ones sold elsewhere on Amazon, but are of nicer, thicker, more expensive looking fabric. I love both these and my cheaper ones. You get what you pay for, so it just depends on what you want out of them. I am 5'3"" and 125lbs and they fit fine.",5
297131,"This was really cute. However, it does run small. I am 5'9, and normally wear a medium. I ordered a large, and it was still too small to snap closed in the chest. I used a safety pin to close it. I got several compliments on this, and will wear it again!",5
583703,These are completely outrageous when it comes to freeky cool stylish & well crafted hardware! The goggles twist off & reveal a 3 part lens on each side. Im pretty sure the lenses are GLASS not plastic so if your more prone to breaking things I'd buy plastic replacements. For sure a good buy & I recommend buying a pair for yourself.,5
796032,"Horrible smell, way too small. I normally wear a medium and ordered an  extra-large because I saw that it ran small. I wish they would have said how small it really was. I couldn't even get past my knees in the leg holes. My breasts were spilling out the top and bottom of the top piece. Overall, I'm disappointed, because it really is cute.",1

Pros:
- Velcro backing makes it easy to place on any velcro attachment.
- Colors match uniforms in Multicam and olive drab (OD).

Cons:
- Might need to snip away some extra threads on the ends of the tab.

Conclusion:
I will definitely order another one of these tab patches again.",5
391271,"I am happy to report I received these earrings faster than expected.  When I opened them, I instantly realized my mistake.  And what was that mistake?  I ordered one set (3 pairs) and I have FOUR daughters. Needless to say, I will be ordering more.  They are bigger than I thought without being gaudy.  My girls love them and are asking for more.  My only hesitation would be not being able to pick the ones I want.  But then again, with as many girls as I have, duplicates should not be a problem.",5
275249,"I just got it. So far it is great. Some concern that other reviewers had about whether it would last. It seems sell made and sturdy enough. If it holds up I will certainly buy more of the.

666302,"This product runs about three sizes small. Knowing that I ordered up.  No complaints and I love it because it is just a basic skirt that you can do anything with. One of the skirts have a shiny material that I did not think I would like but it worked out fine.  This is a decent quality.  I'm one of those women who loves lots of clothes, but I don't always have the perfect skirt to wear with certain things. This fits the bill.",5
375518,This dress runs small. I knew that from reading reviews so I ordered up a size. It's beautiful like the picture. The reason I gave only 4 stars is because there is a blousing on the shoulders that isn't really noticible in the photo but when you put it on is very visible which just changed the look of the dress for me. Still quite adorable just not what I was expecting.,4
713808,very pretty but I read the other reviews & ordered a larger size. It was too big. I probably will not pay attention to the reviews as much next time. some people are basically poopoo heads :  ). Great price so I gave it to a friend. She loved it,4

The shipping was excellent - they arrived in plenty of time, even though I ordered late. Would def. buy again from this seller!",5
214780,"Good quality for the money. I'm one of those guys who tosses between an medium and a large depending on brand, fit, style, etc. I bought the medium in this and it was larger than I would like it to be. Even with the back band cinched all the way down it is still loose on me. I'll definitely need to get it tailored a bit. Other than that a good buy.",4
96913,This is great for anyone who wants to stand out or even if you were going to go LARPING/Cosplay. Its a attention getter since you don't see accessories like this all the time. The metal is a little flimsy so it does need to be handled with care and not bent in anyway or it will break.,4

The shorts weren't high-waisted, not because of a size problem but because of the way they were made.

Definitely not worth it, and you will be returning it .",1
356601,"Cute, but too thin. Would only wear as pjs or hang around the house clothes. My daughter loves fish, so that part is a big hit. The hat is just a throw away for us - when it's hot enough to wear this, you wouldn't try to put a hat like that on your toddler's head.",3
88649,"I really like this dress. I wish I would have got a size larger. I ordered a medium and it fit nicely but a little too short. I'm a bit curvy, 5'2 and 135lbs.

Also, it has no laundering info.

I have to return it, or if too expensive, will give it to Goodwill.",1

Other than that it was a good buy and I would recommend for a fallout fan and needs a new wallet.",4
413938,"It's perfect... pretty, and functional. The best of both worlds. I bought it for my desk at work so that I don't have to leave my bag in a file drawer or on the dirty floor. So now my bag sits nicely under my desk and doesn't take up any room.",4

First time I tried to tie the gold & black one the ribbon came unglued. I plan to replace them with something sturdier from the craft store.

Disappointing for the price: I would expect this if they were $1 apiece but the quality should be better at this price.",2

and chose this one. It looks very nice until you really take a good look the details are not great, the main zipper is weak I wish it looked like the side zipper, very roomy you won't find a side sliding pocket or inside big zipper pocket. Mine is not lined
The color is nice. Overall good for an every day bag.",3

Sent these boots back because I didn't feel right spending that much money on a pair of ""pretty"" boots that I couldn't see myself 'living' in. Real suede, very pretty color, really cute, just not the wow factor I was hoping for in regards to comfort at that price tag.",4

This ring looks as good as the ones in the jewelry store I was looking at that cost 200-400 hundred. Just can't say enough good things about this ring,5

Will definitely purchase again in bigger size.",4
424312,"Well packaged, I love the design. Just the right size I was lookin for. But I expected the diamonds to have more luster. The box chain chain has a very good lobster syle clasp. All in all worth the price I paid for, but not the bargain antisipated. I do enjoy wearing it. So I really can't complain!!",4
671008,"Love it! The material is sleek and feels so nice. I was hoping it would go a little further below the knees but it is great! The top is a basic crop top made from the same material, I like this as well but I already have so many that I was just buying this for the skirt. The shirt is a little short for my taste, but I believe that that is how it is meant to be! Overall, great purchase!",5
70524,"Very cute and the quality is fine but runs large. For a zero to 3 mos outfit this looks more like 6 to 9 mos. I ordered another set from the same brand along with this one, the other being 9 mos, and the pjs are roughly the same size. Like almost exactly the same size. Disappointing because I thought my baby would be able to wear these right away.",4

Plus, they wanted me to pay for ALL shipping & handling for returning it. Very disappointed and feeling disgusted how they could lie to people like that.",1

626779,I should have returned this. Came in with sequins all in the packaging. It was a few shades lighter than portrayed in the photo. I ordered a few sizes up and it was still too small in the hips and large in the top (which is odd because I have DD breasts). It looked cheap.,2
398040,"I bought this for my fiance, thinking it would just be a temporary ring and she would pick something else later, but as it turns out she loves it and is keeping it.

My favorite part though has to be the pockets... Lol",5

Very disappointed.",1

Also, I was looking to replace my really nice leather wallet from Nordstrom (well, Nordstrom Rack) which was a gift a few years back.
This wallet is so flimsy that I just couldn't use it.  I felt like everything would fall out of it.  Also, the zipper pull WILL come off.  It just will.

I'm 5' tall and I ordered M, the things I don't like is it's hard to put them on and hard to remove it bec. no zipper on the back it's like a pullover dress and I have to wear a thicker panty hose bec. it's really thin and sheer but over all looks classy & fabulous!

At first I thought they were to small around the waist but after the first use they actually stretched out and ended up fitting perfectly! i also ordered a small and although they fit great around the waist, were a bit loose on the legs (despite having big calves). Overall very happy with my purchase and will be ordering more soon!",5
568984,"Adorable fabric and the color pictured is exactly the color you get.  Its rather large though however I will keep it as to return costs more than the garment did!  The fabric is nice. I wouldn't think one could swim much in it, more like lounging around the pool but not in it.",3
790742,"Ripped on the second day of wear. Very bad quality. The one thing I do like is how tight they are (at least for me, I am 5'9 usually wear size M) so I can wear them to sleep on cold nights and wake up to my waist looking slimmer.",2
759330,"The shirt is thin and did not come with washing instructions and there is no tag with the material.  I washed it in cold and dried it on low.  It did shrink a little.  It also stains very quickly. But for someone who is more careful, this could be a great shirt.",4

I knew it was not leather when I purchased it, but, I did not expect such poor quality and cheap finish. I had tried to find the leather version but could not. I will not return it but will give it to my 4 year old granddaughter to use for her pretend games. VERY DISAPPOINTED",2

I like the graphics on the glove, it is nice. I also like the velcro area, it isn't made out of the noisey velcro, and that makes me happier. I can't wait to put them into action! If you like fox products then I say get these they are great! ,",5

The clasp IS cheap compared to expensive bands, but I think it will be okay. I'm glad it is the double locking clasp type; if it wasn't, I might not be too confident in how secure the clasp would hold. The band sizes easily by cutting off sections with an X-Acto knife or single edge razor blade.",4
538238,"Horrible!!! The lining is entirely too short and I ordered an XL to be safe (I usually wear a large) and it fit like a tight medium. Also, I ordered a black dress and received LIGHT BLUE. Don't waste your money or time waiting. I waited at least a month to get the wrong color dress in a size that didn't fit.",1

I ordered a Medium and the coat barely fits me, too tight; for everything else I use medium and thing fit fine on me ( coats, jackets, shirts, t-shirts, sweaters, etc. ).

Perhaps these sizes they use are for the European market.

I still have some concerns on the ""fine details of the coat""; a friend of mine is using it; he's smaller than me; we'll see if anything goes wrong.",3
446970,nice look but misleading picture. I was surprised when I received this dress. the picture is somewhat misleading. the upper part of the dress is just lace. there is no inner piece as seen in the picture. you would have to purchase something separately or your breasts will be completely visible from the outside to everyone. the dress is also really short.,3
446240,"I have always loved ""magic wallets"" and when I saw this retro cassette player I had to have it!  I had one previously that was leather and one day my dog decided to tear it to shreds. So far this wallet has been great. The only thing I can say is I wish it was a bit smaller, but that's only because my other one was a little smaller and fit in my pocket more nicely. Overall, I love the product.",5
266274,"I like the suit and the way it fits. But the buttons are too hard if you wear nails. I also wish it came with an opening at the bottom.

848542,"I bought this for my niece as a present. She was so happy when she received it. It fit her as expected and she got a lot of compliments on it at the pool. The quality was good and the color was vibrant. She is already asking me to buy her another one in a different color. Additionally, I liked the price.",5

I was just telling someone who commented on it today that the one I thought I ordered has a more lace-like detail at the bottom (as pictured). The one they sent has several rows of ruffles and do not resemble the lace-like bottom in the picture. It is cute, it fits nicely and I like it, but it is not the product pictured.",4

251334,"Would have loved these had they fit.  Sadly, they were too large for me and I returned them.  I will say that they are very good looking, just the right degree of darkness, and the bifocal isgreat.  They appear to be good quality, came with a nice hard case, and the temples have a good spring hinge.  I would highly recommend.",4
250568,"Cute.  I wear them in my 2nd hole.  Nice little pair for a child  or for a 2nd pair in your ear.  If you have 3 or more piercings in your ear, then this pair might be too busy for additional positions.  But for just 2 holes, you're fine, in my opinion.",4
736482,For the price paid they should have lasted longer then a couple of months. My son got these for his birthday Nov 11 and by mid Dec  the colored design was already wearing off and the stitching is coming undone by the toes. He still likes them but they should  have held up better. then less than 30 days,2
405026,"The pack is well made and the right size for a five-year-old, but it does not have padded straps, which is a deal-breaker for me. The lack of padding means it is only suitable as a toy and not something my preschooler can carry her stuff to and from school in. Not worth it for the price; I am returning it.",2
195615,For the price this is a really great shirt! I love how flowy it is and it doesnt look like its made out of super cheap material! I just had a baby so I still have the post-partum belly that Im super self-concscious about and this shirt makes me feel more confident! I got this quicker than I had expected so its worth the price and wait! Definitely recommend!,5

375299,Package arrived right on time.  After reading some of the reviews I was a little worried about the fit but it fit perfectly!  I'm a bigger women usually wear size 1x to 2 x.

It's very comfortable and light weight!,5

Wats I love about it is that wrinkle free:) (busy mom here) It goes well with capri, jeans and long enouth to wear as a mini dress with boots:) It runs a bit smaller so make sure if you are planning to get this blouse to get it 2 sizes up. I can't think of any negatives related to it. I really like it, and plan on wearing it a lot .",5
446805,"This is a great dress with a little bit of an investment. First of all, it comes very wrinkled, so a good steaming is required to get that sorted out. Also, if you're average height (I'm 5'4"") the dress may be a bit long. If you wear sparkly shoes with it the bottom hem will get caught in your rhinestone settings. Pick up the hem of that sheer material by just a couple inches and it'll make a world of difference. Otherwise, the dress is beautiful! I wore it as a bridesmaid dress and it was perfect!",4
511020,"Very poor quality!!! I had to order a large, even though I need medium bottom and large top. The top is no where near a large it is closer to a small. The underwire was sticking out when I opened the package and the straps were not sewed down the seam. The package didn't come with any return paperwork or instructions. Overall very disappointed!!!",1
711204,"Insufficient weight and warmth to call this a blanket sleeper.  Also, sizing 18-24 months is ridiculous as there is a big difference in the two sizes and this is closer to the 18 month size, so just barely fits the baby.  He will get no real wear from this.  Never heard of his brand and don't care to in the future.",1

I'm 5'4"", which is pretty average and the wrap itself didn't go past my behind...the tassels were pretty long though. However if I were looking for something to cover up with at the beach this might be too short. Overall not a bad product for the price, just not for me.",3

I'm not a gem expert, but the stones are pretty, without visible flaws.  The ring looks more expensive than the purchase price.  It looks great with spring and summer cottons and silks, so I'm quite happy with my ""bargain.""

The top and bottom fit well and are flattering. I am 5'2, 135, and currently wear a woman's size 6(ish) pants. I ordered a large, but probably would have been better off with a medium.",5

140930,"I gave these to an 11-year old special friend who can only wear 14k gold.  She LOVED them.  They are good quality, the color is perfect, and the size was perfect for her ears (I ordered the 5mm size).  The screw backs are secure and have not come unscrewed even with her wearing them 24/7.  While the screw backs are a little small, I had very little issue attaching them in spite of my large hands.  I absolutely recommend these!",5
570250,"I got the gold/silver colored wallet hoping it would look like the picture but it had a mostly bronze-y copper color to it which looked kind of tacky/cheap in my opinion. The main problem with it is that it is SO BIG! Believe me,  I like space in my wallet, but this thing is huge. When it's opened all the way it's [almost] as big as a sheet of paper. I might be exaggerating, but to me it was just way too big.",2
211654,"I am 5'6"" and mostly buy US medium , and based on the reviews i ordered a size 10 .While it is not too large, i feel I could have ordered a size down . But the top is very cute. . Its darker shade of blue ( closer to black ) than in the picture. It feels very soft. But the neckline feels a bit saggy by my standards ( or maybe because size 10 is a bit big for me ) . Overall i think for the price its a good buy and material is alright too .",4
293412,"I bought this necklace for my 7 year old. She thinks it's beautiful. However, the chain was longer than i expected- way too big for her. And the clasp broke the first week. My main disappointment was the text quality. It is quite blurry, and difficult to read if you don't already know the verse. That being said, for the $4-5 dollars i paid for it, i don't feel totally ripped off.",2
827880,"I really like this set, for the price come on !! My little two year old loved it and I was afraid it wouldn't fit him but it was all good.  I really love this company I bought a lot of little outfits and they have arrived weeks ahead of scheduled time.",5
297416,"I bought this as a gift and she absolutely loved it. She did say the size ran a tad big than her usual ring size, but she happily matches it with outfits whether it's for work or a night out. The detail is incredible and the creativity of the jewel placement really makes for a great conversation piece. She's been getting a lot of compliments. You can't beat the price! Worth EVERY penny!!",5

Also, I'm in Afghanistan, and we have been authorized to wear the tan undershirt with the Army PT shorts in the gym, and this is so much better than a t-shirt from clothing and sales.  The only caveat is the price, but sometimes you do get what you pay for.",5
341415,"I am 5'10"" at around 140 lbs and they are definitely long enough but not as fitted as I expected. They are very comfortable and great to wear around the house or under other garments. The shiny spandex looking material makes them a little too casual to wear by themselves and without lining, they aren't very warm by themselves. I'm not disappointed with my purchase.",4
357539,These fit my 7 month old son pretty well. I've been looking for something that would fit him since he has been getting bigger and not fitting mittens available at target or Walmart. My only complaint is that I wish they had more gender neutral colors. Overall a good purchase.,4

829313,"Do not waste your money on this. I realize this will be inside of my purse but what is the point of a brand new item if it comes scratched?? These people are ripping Buyers off. They probably use leftover plastic from who knows where and mark it up as $20 to sell it. Also, if you don't like rattling noises in your purse, don't buy this as it makes so much noise inside with all the stuff rubbing on the plastic. I will buy some fabric and sew a liner for this as the noise really drives me crazy.",1
802181,"I love this bathing suit. It fits perfectly and it is very flattering on a plus size figure. I usually do not buy bathing suits without an underwire because my girls are big.

Since I'm very busty (40G) I just measured my bust and went by that measurement. I then matched it up to the measurement they have with the picture. Which to my surprise was a 4X. It fits beautifully! It comes with a sewn on belt which is great to adjust the waist area. I wore a crinoline or what folks are calling a rockabilly skirt underneath. You don't have to, looks fine without it.",4

591367,I love the ring but am dissatisfied with the sizing. I wear a seven and ordered a seven but it is way to big. A size six would probably have worked. I cannot wear this ring but the cost to send it back does not warrant a return and reorder. The ring is lovely though.,3
7814,I wear a size 38x34 in levis and the 38 carhartts fit me perfectly. These pants meet every single one of my expectations as a contractor that works on home repairs and maintenance all day long. I couldn't ask for anything more and the five pairs I own are all I ever wear to the job.,5
94747,"This stuff looks GREAT! I decorated my whole house with bloody handprints and drips, and made a nice zombie costume for my roommate.

For reference, I'm 5'5"" and 140 pounds and the medium fit me fine.  I did have to wear some boy shorts underneath because it's really short.

I checked several costume shops and amazon had the cheapest price for this.",5

In my opinion, the dress I received is much better than the photo Amazon has depicted. I bought it based on a customer photo of the pink version.
The dress is a beautiful muted turquoise chiffon creation. It does not puff out as shown by Amazon. It drapes. The dress does not have a variation in color or shimmer. It is lovely and elegant.
I hope it fits.",5

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that on the left side, it makes the top of my foot uncomfortable, like I have tightened my shoe too tight, so I have loosened the laces as much as I can.. Other than that, I like them and will continue to wear them. They were recommended by my podiatrist.",4
794454,"the fit of the dress is perfect; however, the bandage cut is a sheer blend and reveals about three quarters of both butt cheeks down to knee in back and from lower waist past the thigh to knee in front.  recommend a better description of this product so others are aware of how revealing this dress looks and the material is very thin.  i was disappointed because the pic looks as though this a covering silhouette dress, but it is more of a covering see-through dress",2
378862,This is perfect! Fits nicely and has lots of stretch to accommodate movement and thicker arms. I am a 38C/D and ordered 1x. It does have a weird smell which faded substantially after washing and a thorough febreezing. Hoping it'll come out completely in the next wash. Definitely a worthwhile purchase.,5

Plastic is a little sticky though.",4

The waist comes around my hips below my belly button and the crotch area is very tight. For the price, I was very disappointed. Not sure why a pajama Jean would not have a high rise fit. Plus they are too short.",1

She feels like an adult because her sunglasses came with a cloth case, a soft plastic case and a cloth for cleaning fingerprints and things off the lenses! I love that they are made of a bendable plastic, making it quite difficult for her to break them. The pink and blue colors are very stylish for a little girl! She couldn't be happier with her new sunglasses! I received this product in exchange for my honest review.",5

I don't know that this is my style, as it may be a little avant-garde for my taste but I don't find that to be something that should be the fault of the item, more the wearer.

The sterling doesn't seem to be too thin as I have worn it over a week now and it has not bent out of shape as some of the reviews that I read. I like it.",5
38580,"The ankles hike up because there's not enough elastic around the ankles. They're cumbersome because they're big. They weren't supposed to have a drawstring but they do. I don't think they're very comfortable. The best thing about them is that they're soft inside, but that won't last after they're washed.",3
622225,"This was really snug and the color was more of a tomato than a cherry.  Didn't look very flattering, maybe its better in a different color.  The material isn't bad, thicker than I was expecting, usually it's thin cheap polyester, but this had some substance to it.  Not sure I'll ever wear, partly because of the color, partly the fit.",3
424479,"This was my first Coach purchase. Lots of their purses/bags I don't like because they've got stupid pockets on them and look like granny bags, but this one is different looking. It's classy, sleek, sophisticated and not gaudy at all. The bottom is a beautiful chocolate brown suede with the C's over it. There are a couple of pockets inside the purse, one with a zipper. The purse is the perfect size: not too big or small. I'm very picky with purses and it takes a lot to impress me. This purse sure does!",4

I cant really explain it, but you will see when you get them. I would but again though because the quality is good and they're soft.",4
295084,This fit runs pretty accurate though maybe a little small in the stomach and too big elsewhere. This is not flattering at all. But some people love the shirts which stick out in the stomach and make you look pregnant. I have a belly so this just accented it worse somehow. Not pleased with this shirt at all. Not flattering.,3
754746,First I want to say how beautiful this tunic is. A very simple A line dress with wonderful hanging grape lace trim. For this I gave it 3 stars. Then there is the fact I ordered it 2 sizes too big and it is still tight across the shoulders and the upper arms. It is shear but great as a tunic style top to wear with leggings and a camisol or as a swimsuit cover up,3
377278,"The only drawback to this bag is that the zippers are a little stiff.  Otherwise, it is fabulous!  There is a pocket for everything!  The bag itself is lightweight, and seems to be waterproof (after surviving a downpour).  It can hold all my stuff plus my Kindle and Netbook.",4
709782,"It is very pretty, but made SO CHEAP! I would be afraid to wash it or it would probably fall apart. No instructions on how to do that, or any label of any kind. Looked like a spider web of yarn throughout the whole inside, had to carefully cut threads then knot the ends before being able to put it on! CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP!!!!",2
466942,This is a beautiful necklace.  I bought it to replace one I bought at a department store that broke within a few months.  The quality of this necklace is so much better.  It has a nice shine to it and does not tarnish.  I would definitely recommend this necklace.,5

576505,"Very cute pants but they are see through. I put them on my daughter under dresses now instead of tights sometimes, she has a couple dresses that go very well with them so we still like them and wear them a lot. You  can't wear them as pants unless you wear white underwear too though, my daughters are mostly bright colors with Disney princesses so it didn't work",3

Not only time did I received this product in a very short time after ordering it, but when I opened the package I instantly fell in love with it!

Thank you so much for making my day =)",5

212268,"Based on the reviews, I thought that the brown dress was going to be maroon. Either I misunderstood, or they fixed the color. The dress I got is like a brownish rust color. I don't think that I would have picked it, but I do like it. Also, the ruffle around the top is quite a bit larger than I expected. I trimmed mine off because I felt like a clown. I'm 5'7"", and I would say that the dress hits mid shin, if you are estimating length.",4
703585,"Cheaply and poorly made. Hideous font, some garbled writing on top, front picture distorted as it is being chewed up by the zipper. I decided to keep it since everybody started laughing at the first sight of this thing, but I don't expect this here set to be worn in public.",2
156115,"It's a great case, I just wish that it had more capacity....I have seven cards in the case and if I fold up cash so that I can put it in the wallet, the clasp will not stay closed....I really do like the product....it just needs to be a little larger to accommodate bill's and card's.....it is still OK as is",5
769102,"I bought a large.  I am 5'4"" and 150lb. The shirt fits a little snug on the arms but loose in the abdominal area. This is what my goal was and it met that.  The shirt was not how I anticipated as I thought it would be waiver as seen in picture. Overall it's a nice shirt but I personally wouldn't pay a penny more than 7$",3
567657,"Beautiful. I ordered a nearly identical pair from another seller, and (as with most 'thigh highs' sold online), they were actually knee socks. This pair, however, was perfect! I'm about 5'6"", 140 lbs. and I have really thick thighs. These thigh highs went way over the knee and stayed there. It's extremely difficult to find actual thigh highs for a reasonable price, and I'll definitely order more colors now. Highly, highly recommended.",5

714028,This suit jacket fit excellent! My husband usually wears a 36r or a 38r. We bought a 38r and it fit perfect. My husband is so excited about it. It's also really good quality. The one thing is that the pants came at a size 31 waist instead of a 32. We are just having the pants taken out.,4
19991,the hats have an adjustable pull to size the hat to fit my daughters head. the ties are also nice so I can control how tight or loose to have it around her chin.  I don't like the elastic ones. The brims are wide which I happen to also like. My daughter doesn't seem to mind wearing hats so this works great for us.,5
554984,"Not only is the coat more than 2 sizes too small, the quality is not up to standards as one of the button fell off as I removed it from the packaging and the other buttons are not expected to stay on the jacket.

The knits are starting to get loose, and I don't know how much longer they'll endure.",3
608681,"Not my first pair.  These are excellent shoes and are worthy of continued use.  This pair was delivered with some scuffs in the leather surface, but other than that they are perfect and were delivered on time.  If I had purchased these in a store, I would have selected a pair without the scuffing, but I think I can correct these with polish and/or stain.  It is not worth the effort to return them for replacement as they will function as expected.",4

Very disappointed when we received the product, as it was still smaller than what my son wears, unless his size grew dramatically in a week :-).
Anyway size is a big issue, so order 3 sizes more bigger in case you really have to.
Quality was ok, nothing to complain on quality or performance.",1

I give this four stars only because the length is a little short. I'm 5'3"" and it comes just above my ankles. I am also 26 weeks pregnant though, so that might play into the length a bit.

As a result of the latter, the brim curls in two places and has permanent creases that I can't get rid of.

491973,Honestly the skirt itself is very shaped and beautiful but if you are bigger than a US size medium DO NOT PURCHASE IT!!!... on the description table it states it stretches to 94 cm waist which is essentially 37 inch waist. I am a us size 14 and have a  32 inch waist a it did not even go past knees fully stretched.  They are not being honest in their description with measurements. So if you are bigger than a US size medium (10)  do not purchase!!!!!!,2

Not worth $159.99- don't waste your money!!!",1

My only complaint is that the seam between the index finger and the middle finger ripped after about one week of use, on one glove - that's why I had to knock off a star...I'd probably do 4.5 stars if it were a choice. Despite that, I really do love these gloves, and they're worth the cost to have cat paws!",4
187114,"Got the suit in the mail and immediately loved the design and color. Tried it on and it fit perfectly. The high waist was a bit higher than I expected, but it does fit. The top is padded and the top and back ties in back which makes it easy to adjust.

Delivery was quick too.",5

I let him know up front that it wasn't cashmere, but it's hand-feel is wonderful, and it feels especially comfortable around your neck and chest in cold winter weather. The deal-maker here is you've got virtually all of the things that make cashmere so great, but not the astronomical price of cashmere. Easily the best Christmas gift this past year, and he's been very pleased, all winter long.",5

219729,Before i even read the reviews on this i had bought it. When i started to look into it more i was scared that i wasted my money. But i just got it and i love it especially with my leggings. Yes the bottons look kind of cheap but i actually like it. Im 110 pounds and about 5'2. I got the xs and i think it fits great. I hope this helps,4
278357,When it comes to wallets I have never had much luck. Not until I bought this one. It has just the right amount of room I need for my things. I really love it also due to the size and color. Blue is my favorite. And I cant forget to mention the fact that its a KPOP WALLET!,5

However, these gloves were too big & fingers were too long for my daughter. So I, the mother, wear them for now - FYI I fit into clothes for 13 to14-yr-old.",4

It's a great bathing suit if you just want to read a book pool-side by yourself, or if you have the kids and are going to be running around chasing after them. The ruching  on the bottoms is also a good camouflage if you want to hide a little belly fat.",4

I would certainly purchase more from this company. The delivery was timely, which is always a plus!",5

I am not going to complain about that issue because I am just built different with no real waist and smaller in the hips and thighs.  I really like the weight of the jeans, perfect for our hot and humid weather here in the south.",5
308690,DO NOT BUY. Horrible hat. For the price you will receive a $3.50 hat made in china. The hat was oddly shaped. The fabric was cheap. The feather bent. Buy this hat if you like the sinking feeling of regret. To make things worse the seller DOES NOT PAY FOR RETURNS. In the end I had to pay $14 just to return this awful thing.,1

Also, there is a glob of glue on the top of the beadwork (on the top that) that digs into my chest/skin that makes it very uncomfortable .. The scrunch on the bottoms is flattering, but they constantly roll, showing the white liner",1

Ordered 12 mo socks and he is 8 months (with large feet) and has been wearing them for two months. He was an early crawler and is days away from walking so I usually let him go barefoot but needed something for out in public that was more functional than the chunky shoes I've seen.,3
229263,I was very excited to receive this even as soon as it arrived i opened it just by looking at it i can tell it was extremely small i bought a 2x because i knew the size ran small so i took the highest they go to and this shirt could fit my daughter thats an xmall just not her color so wat do i do now...is very dissapointed.i should get another shirt,2
239445,I purchased this ring after I was dissapointed with the look and fit of a 2mm tungsten ring. I'm so glad I purchased this ring. The white tungsten looks like white gold or sterling silver instead of the traditional gunmetal look o regular tungsten. Fits true to size. Love love love,5
677884,"I reviewed this product in exchange for my honest review. The material is thinner than I expected to be, however, it's still very cute. I read a review about the split not being the same but for me it was. Different body shapes I guess. The dress is very form fitting so I suggest getting a larger size if you want extra room to move around. It's a great date night dress, my man loves it.",4

If you' re looking for something that will give that lindybop look I don't recommend this dress. However it's a nice enough summer dress. Also bought black boat neck dress same flaw, skirt is not circle as described.",1
453093,A very lovely well fitting dress. Lucked out with one since most times the product received is a far cry from the picture being shown. The fabric is just right for this style dress. The style with peplum is very forgiving and perfect for covering the midzone problem areas while giving the illusion of curves. Be very careful when ordering your size.  I typically wear an US 12 and the XXL was the best fit. Get ready for the compliments you'll receive ,5

I waited patiently this afternoon for the mail to arrive but was disappointed when I unpacked the wallet.

I really like it otherwise.",1

I couldn't tell from the picture but they're also gold, I'm not at all in to gold... # Disappointed...",1

Moochi is always my go-to because I live in a very hot climate where I sweat a lot and low quality metals just do not hold up well. This set is gorgeous but I would not recommend using the chain they give you. It started turning orange after only 1 wear! The earrings and pendant look just fine however.,4

Also, my biggest complaint is that it is not long enough, and it constantly pushes the top of my pants down. I quit wearing it because it would go over the edge of all my pants. All day long I was pulling up my pants and pulling down my shirt. I am 5'8'' with a 29"" waist. I bought the medium.",3

I feel pampered when I wear this around the house. The pants are somewhat large, both in length and in the midsection. I am average height, and the length of the pajama pant seems more like what a tall woman would need to wear. The straps on the top are adjustable also. Very pretty, soft, and warm fabric is soothing to the touch.",5
731637,"Love this coat. The collar is what got my attention. It's a man's coat, but I really liked it. ONLY issue, it's cut for a man, so any women without a flat bottom, the rear tail will not lay flat-just won't. Very clean lines, lots of pockets, warm to about 35 degrees, then need a layer under it. Then it's warm to about 20 degrees. It's not a heavy winter coat, but a nice clean looking dress casual coat. Very happy I bought it.",5

However, the legs on the product were HUGE in diameter.  My wife said they looked like balloon pants.  And I agree.  I do not know but I can imagine that the size L would have the same leg diameter problem.  Will donate to Salvation Army.  Maybe someone is built to wear these.",1

I measured my wrist and its circumference is a little over 7-1/2"" and this watch, adjusted to the max almost chokes my wrist and is very difficult to get on and off because of the band length. Seller should have put the actual length range of the band from min to max based on the adjustments",2
781785,"Lovely dress, if only the sizing is correct. I normally wear a medium, am 5'6, 138lbs and the large is still too close. I mean, it does fit since the material is stretchy, but being a bandage dress, all other bets are off if you have any flaws. I'm working out, so I am going to keep it.",3

Sizing I bought a 14 for her, she's 5""4' , 120 lbs. but a 36DDD and it fits perfectly.
They still looks great after several washes. I use cold water, quick wash on delicate cycle in a laundry bag and dry on a hanger.
 Couldn't be easier.
This one in particular the satin underlay was sown backwards, seam was facing out. We keep it because it really wasn't that noticeable.",5

I expected at least to find a notebook compartment inside, but no, there's nothing that can justify the MSRP.

However, as a freebie, it's alright. You buy a watch and get it as a gift. I have seen better backpacks being given away in career fairs though.",2
386820,"I was worried about it not fitting right because the straps aren't adjustable. Happily found out the straps are stretchy & fit fine. It's somewhat more narrow across the chest (on me, not a manufacturer issue) but the medium part is accurate for band size. I'd recommend this bra for sure.",5

I was disappointed that I got the wrong size and tried to shrink it in the washer/dryer. It worked and it ended up fitting well enough for her to wear, which was great for me, but would not be ideal for someone who wanted to preserve the true size.

The sleeves are way too short, the color is wrong and it took all but 10 minutes for the strings to come apart and a hole to appear. I'm really disappointed. I waited about a month to get this shirt and it wasn't worth it at all. I would return it but the company wants nothing to do with returns.",1
697774,A little bigger than I thought but I love it. Arrived much earlier than it said. Also made a special request (to change the chain length) and they got back to me immediately and did it. They also sent a little bracelet as a gift and each piece had a little note in it. Really happy :),5
534587,"Surprisingly well-made and vibrant! I'm a true size S (small) in US sizes but I ordered an XL because I read so many reviews about it being too small and wanted to make sure it would fit. I think the Asian size XL is closer to an American size M/L so if you plan on ordering this please make sure to only go up one or two sizes! It's really cute though, and I plan on altering it to make it smaller.",5
246824,"I like the triple levels of this necklace and the look of the chains and pendants.  I do not like that the pendants are hooked into one of the chain links so when I first put it on, the pendants did not lie in a row.  Since I have jewelry tools, I opened the links on each pendant and looped them around the chain, so each pendant slides freely along the chain.  Much better!",4
160512,"I would give this buy ten stars if I could.  for the price, the quality is unbelievable.  ring is adjustable and is okay for an casual wear, no one will know.  My 77 year old mom loved, wants one too!  I will be ordering more asap",5
57163,"I love this! Been  looking for something that would let me just have my phone and keys/cc/money all together, and this helped a lot!! I carry my driver's license, insurance cards, and 10+ cc, and some cash. I can run out of the door with all my essentials at a grab! LOVE IT! Buying more fo rmy mom and sister as presents. Not too big. And it is lightweight (cloth material), so it doesn't get in the way while my keys are in the ignition area of my car.",5
508426,"This felt more like a corset than a vest and I ordered a size bigger just in case! These vests are cut VERY SMALL. Suggest two to three sizes bigger than what you normally wear. As for the actual vest itself, it looks very nice and the fabric feels fantastic but not being able to put it on what I can review is very limited.",3
331802,"I bought this belt a couple of years ago; wore it every day. Finally, the leather started to split. I just received my second one. This is a great belt. You should buy it if you're looking for a new belt. If you're not looking for a belt, you should probably stop reading belt reviews.",5
87685,"I was a bit nervous to buy this because of all
The negative reviews, but once I got it I was so happy at the outcome. First off, the dress arrived 2 weeks earlier then expected and the material isn't as cheap as everyone said it was. The material is a good silk material, it's not the thickest but it's not too thin that you can see your undergarments. The only thing is it is a but short, but that's not a big issue. I'm wearing it right now and I love it. The belt is adorable too! Very simple dress(:",4
844703,"This is the third pair I've ordered!  They are perfect for glasses and cell phone.  The cases have easy squeeze top opening and are lined.
The soft cases fit nicely into casual and evening handbags.  They would make a pretty and appreciated gift.  One small issue is the stitching came out of one of the pink cases leaving the holes visible, but, the holes are tiny and the lining isn't affected.

SELLER PLEASE NOTE:  This review is submitted with my initials ""MB"" and not my name.  Please do not ask for another review. Thank you.",5
760679,"So I put it on and the fabric stretched and got all weird. It's not like it's a normal material for the shirt. Idk what it is but I don't like it. Then when I wanted to return it, I had to pay to return it so I'm just going to find someone who might want it. I hate this so much.",1
882553,"I'm pretty unhappy with this purchase. To start, it has a horrible odor that I hoped would fade. Now it's been over a month and it still stinks but it's too late to return. I wish I returned it sooner. In addition it's SO floppy. It's hard to get things in the right compartment when dropping them in. Lastly one of my buckles is broken. It still works but it doesn't rotate the way it's supposed to so the strap twists up.",1
841645,"These are advertised as being able to keep you dry. They do not, at all. Any large raindrop goes right through the pants. I have ordered waterproofing spray to try and salvage these pants, if that doesn't work then this was a waste of 40$. If you are looking for something waterproof, these are NOT the pants. They do fit as expected though and are comfortable.",2
602896,I bought this mask for a Mardi Gras party.  It was the most beautiful mask there.  I was a little worried about it having a headband instead of a strap behind the head.  The headband is awesome!  Seriously!  It stayed on better than any other mask I've worn.,5
77503,"I love this little pouch. I use it to hold my rosary and prayer beads. All the other little old ladies have pastel zip pouches they keep theirs in, but I needed something more masculine to hold mine in. I use the extra room inside to place prayers in. It is perfect for what I need it for and is very high quality.",5
685226,"I love everything about this bag and always get compliments.  The colors are just as shown!
I believe there was one similar on a social media site for at least 3 times the cost so not only did I get a fabulous bag but I feel like I made a smart purchase, considering its just what I needed.",5
552330,"About a half size larger than listed.  Bought for a preteen, will wear it as a tunic over leggings.  Need a tank underneath as neckline is a bit wide for her. Very bright and attractive. Was looking for something for this age that did not look revealing or inappropriate, this fits the bill.",5
770990,"I love this top!  I bought a size larger than normal because I have long arms for my height, and I prefer my tops have extra ""flow"".  It fits perfectly and is well made.  The material is thicker than expected and launders well, but best to dry flat or on hanger to smooth out the lacy parts while they are damp. Get compliments every time I wear it!",5
23993,"I've been looking for a simple black hat with a hole in the back for my ponytail. For a woman, I have an average size head and it fits good. It covers a little bit of your top ear but it's better than having to constantly pull it down and adjust it. The bill of the hat was larger than I expected but overall a good hat for everyday wear.",4
29791,"These are great! I have chubby thighs and short legs and these fit perfectly. No muffin top, and they actually go on my thighs, not almost in my crotch. I think they would fit on someone taller and slimmer as well because they're incredibly stretchy. I've honestly never been happier with something that I bought for five bucks.",5
136466,"This is easily the best shirt I have gotten that's Allegra K.
The only issue is minor - it's a little small for my chest, but it's not to the point where it's uncomfortable since I can open a button. I recommend you get one size larger than you need.
For being Allegra K, the quality is great.
Overall, it's worth buying.",4
540221,This came in only one size. It is very snug on me. It is tight in my upper arms but Im on a weight lose regimen and hope it will fit me perfectly in a month or so. It is really pretty and the lace is soft. Its like wearing lace stockings. I like the soft fabric against my skin. I received it about 2 weeks sooner than expected.,3
36350,The umbrella is very cute but it showed up with a powdery substance all over it. I am not sure if they put it on the product on purpose to keep it from sticking to itself but it makes it look dirty. I will have to clean it before giving it as a gift.,4
40142,"I've owned two pairs of Havaianas so far but that's mainly because of how well made they are. They may seem pricey but it's so worth it. As a true summer person, I basically spend the entire season in flip-flops. I live in NYC so walking is a grand part of my everyday life and these flip-flops are perfection. Their thick soles provide the comfort needed when walking throughout the city. They're durable and true to size.",5
224172,Item came in and already it is fraying. Just out of the package and strings everywhere. Unable to try it on because waist is sewed with no give and does not go over shoulders or past thighs. Very disappointed because it looks super cute and wanted to surprise husband on a weekend getaway. Going to attempt to fix it on my own because it is too close to getaway to return and get something else.,2
212067,"These are very adorable, but they are a little bigger and wider than I would have thought.  I had to wear them on top of leggings in order for them to fit...my legs are not super skinny, but they were baggy.  I did get a lot of compliments on them, though.",4
224607,"The bag is just as describe,soft,light weight to your shoulder and the color is beautiful i ordered the brown and i love it. The inside of the bag has a compartment for ipad or small computer and the middle part is large enough to hold a lot of things. I am glad i make the right decision to buy this bag no regrets. I would recommend this bag as a 5 star. E verywhere i go i get compliments.please,please buy this bag.",5
399012,"The box looks elegant but if you're a light sleeper you may want to move it to another room. The winding machine hums and you could hear a soft tick-tick sound when it winds. but...
Wide bands fits and its triangular shape keeps large watches from hitting the glass. It kept my husband's expensive automatic watches on time.",3
111936,"These brand of ChubbyChico Charm bangles are great! I got some as gifts for family and friends, the sayings are positive and nice gage. I like them so much I'm getting some for myself and they looks great with other accessories and bangles. The only thing is the writings of the quotes are a bit small. But very clear. I recommend it.",5
856821,"Love this!  Takes me back to my teen years of the '70's : )

Perfect length.  Some might get away with wearing it as a dress.  No see-through under the arms, as it is seen perfectly to cover up.  I have one gripe.  I wish it were cotton.",5
152016,"I loved the shirt, it was exactly what I expected.  It fit the way its suppose to and excellent for the price.  The colors were nice.  I would of gave it 5 stars but its not the highest quality material but good enough.  I will order more from this seller.  The package arrived on time well packaged.  Very well packaged. The fit was good, the colors were good.  I would recommend this shirt and seller to petite girls.",4
644457,"Its really comfy and I really enjoy getting this cause I really wanted a cloak and didn't know where to get one so I went to Amazon and I saw a couple offers,but when I looked at this one it looks good,I liked that they put a picture of team hebi (if that's what you called it) so I could compare the cloak with the picture. I am glad that I got this and proud to be an Akatsuki!

  Akatsuki out!",5
881005,Seal was broken and it was opened.  There was a rhinestone that had fallen out of the bottom of the clutch but was in the bow so I can easily glue it back. Slightly disappointed that it was tampered with but still happy with the clutch itself. It's gorgeous and heavy.,3
865286,"Love this cute little spoon necklace. It's exactly as pictured (I was slightly worried as I'd ordered a different one and received something really weirdly sized, it was like a nearly full-sized teaspoon on a necklace. Weird!) I do wish the spoon had a bit more of a scoop shape to it since it is flatter than expected, but it will still work for its intended purpose. Very cute and I'm happy!",5
558805,"I wear a size 2-4 normally, and I ordered a size Large. It fits perfectly like in the picture, the fabric drapes perfectly so you can wear it without a belt and it doesn't look like a shapeless sack, like some materials can. If you are going to buy this and you want it to look loose, like in the picture, I would suggest going up a size or two than you normally wear.",5
734771,Cute hat that will go with the 'Vader Long Sleeve Juniors Skaters' dress. This is for opening night of the new Star Wars movie! The hat gets us around the theater's rule of no masks. SO cute! The hat is for an 8 year old and it fits her perfectly.,5
403336,"I bought the gloves in February, and completely in love with the product. Soft warm, and outstanding color. The only thing I did find it of the right size since I have small hands (not like a child just normal female elegant hands and fingers) so the gloves should be also  made of my size 5,6, Otherwise the product is of excellent quality",4
331076,"Quality of these gloves feels great. I haven't used them yet in the cold but I think they will keep my hands warm skiing.
They do run big. I had ordered the unisex black M ones first and they were huge and then the white M women's and I am keeping them but still on the big side and I have big hands.",4
120525,"After reddy other reviews I ordered the 24 month size for my son who wears 18 month shorts and pants. It is a perfect fit for him, it is snug but not too tight. Nothing has leaked out yet and I love the side snap buttons for easy removal. It has been washed about 15 times and has held up great! I would highly recommend!",5
346876,"I got the maxi sequin split dress. I am returning it because it is slightly too large. I ordered the Asian Medium, which is supposed to fit like a small, but it is still too large on me, and does not hug my body. I wish they offered it in the Asian Small.

That being said, it is still a lovely dress for the price. The straps are thin and stretchy, but adjustable. The coverup underneath is opaque and that fit very well. Sequins got a bit itchy. Overall, great dress for the price.",3
120397,"This year's version is much better than previous diapers I have seen.  I Love Love Love the snap front.. These swim diapers are more than worth the money..and last longer than the summer... We ordered a 3T, and my little is just getting into 3Ts, this is a little snug around his thighs, and hes not really a chunk if you know what I mean.. but they do not seem like they will get ""too small"" for him..Otherwise, love them!",5
855129,"I'm a size 12 women's, 13 juniors. I bought an extra large because ppl were saying it ran small. It was way too big. I returned it and ordered a large. It was tight in the waist, but big in the hips. I returned it. Just was not a good fit for me. Too bad because they're cute shorts.",2
343399,"I was disappointed in the size of the LARGE packing cube. For the LARGE size I was expecting a shirt sized cube and found it to be TOO small. The Large size would be good for t-shirts, socks, underwear, but not shirts. I equate this brand's Large to another brand's Medium. The cubes appear to be modestly made and should hold up under normal wear and tear.
I will update with travel use.",3
21630,I love this sung at for my son! I got size 0-6 and my son is now 13months and it just started to not fit him anymore! I bought this hat when my son was 5 months old! It fit him perfectly then till recently ! You can tighten it or make it bigger! It's perfect!!!! My son is above height average just to make you get more of an idea! Definitely recommend.,5
361326,"For a sketcher product they fit a bit tight and short but I wouldn't buy them bigger....they'd be too big.
I purchase alot of Sketcher shoes and can say these while being ok and look just like the description, are more in looks like a snow or cold outside boot. I was hoping it could be worn with boot cut jeans, but I wouldn't unless it was cold outside.  I think it's because of the look of the bottom....
Not as comfortable as I'm used to with Sketchers but still nice.",3
385016,"These socks are AMAZING! They don't show in any of my shoes. The toe comes up to where you can still see a bit of cleavage between my toes, so you could wear them with a relatively low-cut ballet flat and probably still be in good shape. THEY DO NOT SLIP!!! After a full day of walking around NYC where I live, I have been extremely comfortable and secure in them all day!",5

I read through the description, so I was aware that only the bottoms were included. i'm very satisfied with this product! I was worried that the small/medium wouldn't fit. I'm 5'3"" and wear a size 0-2 and it fit fine. I love it so much and can't wait to wear it this summer. I was looking for suits like this last year and they all priced at $50-100. so the price isn't bad at all!",4
828348,"Purchased two of these based on the reviews.

Just had the opportunity to use ONE this past weekend on a domestic flight.

I am VERY disappointed with the quality as the handle came apart after just ONE usage. I'm reaching out to the manufacturer to make this right.

Amazon delivered as promised.

Update:  ZERO contact from vendor and/or manufacturer about a CLEARLY defective product since review was posted. Remember, a product is only as good as the people who stand by it. Nobody seems to stand by this product.

Walk away!",1
30261,"Thought these are supposed to be WOMEN's tights, when I tried to put them on, they couldn't go past mid-thigh. I am 5'7"" and have never had tights fit like this. The plus size part is true, they fit very well around my legs, they just stopped going UP my legs while the crotch was still at my knees. I bought these for a witch costume for school and was very disappointed that they didn't work.",1
455276,"I don't just wear gloves for fashion, I have a circulation problem so I wear them inside and outside to keep my hands moving. I'm always looking for cute gloves that can stand up to daily routine and not fall apart. These are very cute, made well and I can wear them with fun outfits. They aren't bulky so I can do tasks like writing or texting with them and they hold up ok in the wash. Affordable and cute. Ticks all the boxes.",5
197814,I'm in love with my bathing suit. I'm 5'8 and wear a 36 B and this bathing suit did not disappoint. My top fit just fine it did come with creases but I expected that. I ordered it July 7 and it came in today on July 9. I selected standard shipping and didn't think it would be here so quick considering it told me it would arrive around the 16 or 17. It's not stretchy so make sure you measure yourself.,5
156497,"i had one of the sold on tv plastic wallets and it kept breaking,so I decided to try one of these stainless steel wallets.  The stainless steel wallet is made in the USA and it feels very solid,the only thing that would make it better is if it held a couple more credit cards. So far I am very happy with it and would highly recommend it.",5
550551,"After ordering this dress and waiting 3 months to get it. I was very disappointed in the material. The seam of the dress was off. The side seam comes to the front. I really was hoping I would love the dress. I wore it to my God sister's engagement party and received great comments about how cute I looked but I had to keep my blazer on all evening. The picture makes it look so attracting.
This dress is a dud.",2
306097,"I received these as a christmas gift and I really like them! I'm 5' 7"", 200 lbs, and normally wear a size 12/14 in pants. I got these in an XL and they fit very well! They are a bit see through but are great for cardio workouts like running or the elliptical. The pockets are pretty small though. I am able to put my phone in, but it doesn't zip up.",4
458225,"The necklace is stunning once it's out of the package...the pearls on mine are more white than cream (shown in the picture) but still gorgeous nonetheless.  The picture does a good job of conveying the overall piece, but the color and brilliant luster of the pearls cannot be conveyed.  Delivery was unexpectedly fast.  It was definitely worth the money.",5
388534,"I got the green one. Color was exactly as shown. Fits just as shown. See through to a large degree, as shown. Beautiful flowing top. This is a favorite for sure! I am bigger than the girl in the picture, but this top is very slimming with the lighter on top and darker at the bottom. Very flattering, I feel.
Would buy again.",5
135235,"Sizing is a tad large and they are insanely long.  Only option is to have them hemmed.  I was worried that they might be small, because they are advertised as ""junior"".  Ive been looking for some plus sized jeans with that bold stitching, but not too much bling.  At $25, I'm thrilled with this purchase.",4
850586,So far I've only tried on these workout capris. I bought 2 sets with different prints. They do seem to fit slightly small compared to the same size in different brand workout capris. The black with white hearts seem slightly see through. They both are thin material so I'm hesitant to actually work out in them in public. I'll update when I workout in them to test how they hold up with sweat.,3
784005,"I purchased as a gift for my teenage daughter. She loves loves this little necklace. The fit is perfect. It is light weight and delicate, yet there is no worry of it easily breaking with her active days.  When she flipped over the pendant and found the backside was pretty too, she commented how clever.  Shipping was quick and without issue. Ver pleasure with this purchase. Oh, and she suffers from sensitive skin and hasn't had an issue.",5
812356,"This is a great ring and it fits perfectly. It's a great conversation starter. I looked at other rings, and although the Lords Prayer and I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength are wonderful Scriptures, my question to myself was, What is the most important thing to me? And the answer is Jesus. So when someone comments how much they like it, it gives me the opportunity to tell my story. You don't know who you will touch. So if you are hesitating, don't!!
Their ring sizes are pretty accurate.",5
115983,"Most comfortable boxer briefs I have worn.

I went on a frenzy to find the most comfortable boxer briefs and alas I've chosen these. In my search I tried Saxx, Obviously (various models), ExOfficio, Calvin Klien Micro.

These exhibit the least amount of leg ride. They have the right support for the boys (keeping them from sticking to your legs but also not constricting). Material quality appears good and I have not had any issues with tearing of material as noted in some of the other reviews.",5
659582,"Perfect. My 7 and 8 yr old girls are long and very thin. 1-pce suits look ridiculous on them- if I get them long enough, they are gaping in the chest and stomach.

470218,"It fits me great, I am 5 foot 7 and I weigh 135 pounds, and it is great. The dress is not snug on the top and the skirt portion is flowy and adorable. The belt is kind of cheap and I don't expect it to last for a very long time, but is is easily replaceable. Overall, I was satisfied with this product. It came 15 days earlier than expected too.",4
777417,"Terrible quality, missed stitching and loose threads on every seam. The buttons to attach the hood didn't line up leaving it lopsided. Arms are way too wide and a few inches too short. Was going to return but their return address is in London and I would have barely broke even anyway so I guess I'm keeping it, maybe I can find someone to give it to.",1

340169,"We absolutely adore these suspenders. For our little guy with long legs and a small waist, they are perfect. He wears them with jeans, shorts, even {gasp} with sweats. The suspenders are so vintage looking though, they make almost anything look adorable. They are also sturdy and well made. I accidentally stepped on one of the fasteners. Instead of breaking, it fell apart in complete pieces which I then put back together, good as new. Love! These were a great purchase for us.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.",5
182573,"I got it way earlier than expected which was nice. I should have ordered a size down though. xD I was worried about the size and I'm big in the hips but small in the chest so I got a xxl (5'6"" and 160ish lbs, most in my waist, butt and thighs) but I could have been fine with a L or XL. The bust is HUGE on me, and its a lot longer than I thought.
I'll give it a wash and see if it'll shrink up - other then that, I like it and so does my boyfriend. :)",4

I really like the hood which makes it a bit different from other denim vests. It is very cute!",5

This one is only $5.99 and the quality is pretty good. I got this for her for Christmas and she wears it a lot and so far there's nothing wrong with it.

49586,I wore this for 3 days after I had the baby and immediately the fabric would fold over in the back. It was also too big to wear after the first week so now I have to buy another band to keep wearing. It was definitely not worth the $50 I paid for it.,2
631493,"Its perfect and very comfortable. I Highly recommend it. I've been lucky enough to breastfeed 3 babies. Now, finally, with my third baby I found the perfect nursing bra. I wish this would have been around when I had my first baby. It is truly comfortable and is easy to use. I can wear it during the day and can sleep comfortably at night with it too.",5
508832,"I didn't expect much as I didn't pay much, I wore this for a costume and it worked out great, however when the item arrived there were parts of the sleeve that were missed in the seam leaving holes. being somewhat of an ok sew person I patched it up pretty well. just remember you get what you pay for.",3
604465,"What great shirt, and what isn't visible in the phot is a very very light blue hibiscus print (almost like ghost underlayed). The fabric is true linen which is light and breathable without any of the scratchiness that you sometimes get. A great shirt, so great I'm getting married in it!",5
541986,"These are great!  My daughter had an ice skating birthday party so we handed these out as favors, they were a huge hit!  Plus we had extra left over for daily use.  They are stretchy enough to fit my 5 year old and me!  Would totally buy them again.",5
163774,"My husband loves these.  He's so picky - he wants a thick, substantial T-shirt but also one that breathes and doesn't feel ""heavy"".  I've been searching for years.  In the past, he'd always say ""I'll live with XYZ but try to find me better ones"".  I finally found Joe's and he's genuinely happy.  We've already stocked up and are ordering more.",5
817691,The shirt is not loose fitting as in the picture.  The arms are close fitting.  Not tru to size. The shirt seems to be not professionally made cause one of my sleeves was shorter than one and some stitching  wasn't cut off.  Dissapointed. You get what u pay for.,2
271325,I am sooo disappointed. the red was messed up in the picture. it bled i guess very strongly and the neckless looks like something my five year old did. I bought this for my sister's b-day and i nearly cried tears when i opened it up to rebox it for her. I am mostly upset because i couldn't just order this but had to spend more money to get it as an add on.. for nothing. someone should really check the quality before sending it out.,1
93701,"It fits as I expected it to, however, the belt was very deceiving in the picture. I was under the impression it was a wide belt that was held in place somehow. When I got it out of the package, it was just a piece of cloth that was hardly long enough to tie around me and it kept slipping away from where the seams are. I'll have to buy a different belt to go with it but overall I'm happy with the purchase.",4
374308,"THIS BAG HELD ALL MY STUFF, I do computer science in school so it carries my dell 15inch laptop, around 4 large books and other stuff i throw in it and also i occasionally throw stuff in it. for a bag that appears small it holds A LOT and pretty durable.. had it for over 6 months.",5
105311,"I got this dress today, & it fits AWESOME! It is very flattering! I have 36DD breast & it doesn't smash the 'girls' to pancakes like other dresses. The skirt very roomy for a silky material, & surprisingly its not clingy by static cling! Just might wear it for Thanksgiving, cause it will be very forgiving. GO for it! You can't beat the price!!!!!! Oh & I ordered this 10 days ago & it came from ChinaVERY HAPPY about that!",5

The most Amazing thing about this Prayer Shawl is the name New Covenant. I am the Revivalist at the end of this month and the Theme is, ""New Covenant, He Has Chosen You.""

I most definitely will be having my Prayer Shawl with me.",5
219796,Worked perfectly for a good cheap gift! My friend loved it and there weren't any problems with it. I think the only thing I didn't notice was that the gem at the top is green but that wasn't an issue. I turned out looking exactly like the photo. Shipping took quite awhile... That's why you should upgrade to Prime.,5
299728,Dress is nice but runs big. I read previous reviews that all said it runs small. I'm 5 '8 and 130. All my measurements were for a small so I didn't think it would be a problem. The dress reached the floor when in flats so I would also recommend anyone shorter to also prepare to wear heels with it.,2
327357,This is a very nice fleece hat nicely made very warm and soft very good for a cold winter day love how it protects your face i got this for my own personal review this would be a great Christmas gift for him or her I give 5;stars I.myself plan to order some for gifts there great!!!,5
437751,"These would work fine if I was looking for tights to wear under a longer dress but they are pretty see through. Definitely not what I was hoping for. Fit is also a little funny. I'm sure they would be fine for someone without much in the way of hips and backside, but that's not me.",2
631110,"This is a classic fit shirt, maybe even a little bigger - meaning that there is a lot of extra room around the waist area. If that's your fit, this will probably work for you. Otherwise, look for other options that have a slim or tapered fit. Also, the cufflinks, tie and cummerbund are not as high quality as some of the other ones you can get sold separately.",1
711479,"I was expecting a soft hoodie to wear around the house, this came and it wasn't what I expected but I love it. I live in Seattle and it's great for this time of year when it's cool outside. It's very thick, sturdy material. Nicely made. Fit a little smaller than expected but I still like it.",4
180793,"After reading the reviews, I went ahead and got this jacket in a large (I'm usually a small).

It fit perfectly, and I have gotten SO many compliments on this jacket. It looks great, it feels great, just be sure to size up.

A lot of people have been asking me how/where to get it. Seriously a great Jacket!!!",5
362713,"Past the metal (faux) buckle I would call this ""incomplete""
I am a 40-42 waist and had this thing set to the end of the straps to fit.
The holster is too small to fit most of the replica blasters on the market (seems like the obvious use)
**Holster does not include the leg strap as featured in the films.  Glaring mistake- functionally deficient without it!**
Holster sticks out oddly without the strap.  I cut a small slice and used a brown ribbon

Once you fix the issues this is the key piece to complete a Han Solo look.",3
235027,"CUTE. CUTE. CUTE! Excellent quality item, well sewn! This is a medium-lightweight polyester with spandex, so it is extremely comfortable - stretches and gives as you walk/sit. Be SURE to measure your waist and hips according to the sizing chart on this item. I usually wear a size Medium, but ordered in the Large ranged based on the measurements listed. Fits perfectly! Very pleased with this!",5
863588,"The design is great only the fit is a bit awkward I'm a size 6 and thought that I need an L after I followed the sellers guide, came out I need to order what I'm normally wear. Try order your own size before the changeup, it might turns out great on first try.

I received this product at discounted price for my honest review.",4
569310,"I bought the fascinator for a costume party, and I was SO happy with it!  It took a few days of being out before the veil and feathers recovered from being packed in so small a package, but it arrived about a week before my event so I was fine.  They included a nice note and instructions on how to revive the hat more quickly if needed.  Very happy with my purchase!",5
655578,"I am 5'3 and 115lb. After hesitation from previous reviews, I ordered a small and it fits me perfect! I love this outfit. Yes, it is a bit see through as you can tell by my photo but not enough to be worried about. The material is very comfortable. I cannot wait to wear this for my upcoming beach vacation! Highly reccomend!",5
156381,The metal wallet is very well made and attractive. I wanted a slim wallet as I wear suits and sport coats a lot. I probably will not use this wallet very much however because it is too thin and will not hold the six or 7 cards I usually need to carry with me. It's probably ideal for a Friday night out when all you want in your pocket is as little as possible. I'll need a thicker wallet for international travel.,4
488013,"It came with some scratches but otherwise it's really good. I expected it to be a slightly heavy necklace, but it's really light. A dirty trick was played though, in the package my EXO wallet came in (they were ordered together) it said the necklace and wallet were both in there, but I couldn't find the necklace so I looked inside the wallet. The necklace was placed in the wallet. That momentary freak out about not having my necklace scared me. Either way I got it and i'm very pleased with what I got.",4
243936,I am 5'8 and 225. Very curvy and wear regular size 14/16. I ordered the 4XL. I hate that number of course but the suit fits very well. I am part of a fundraiser bike wash so wanted something sexy and retro but still allowing me enough coverage to work around the bikes. The bottom is a thin material and doesn't have any type of 'support' so i may consider wearing some shape wear under it for the purposes of my event.,5
664133,Even better in person! What impressed me most is that the rhinestones adhered to the hat are quite sturdy. The colors are also very nice. Not too bold and not too faded. I purchased this for my mom and she says she gets compliments every time she wears it. This hat shimmers speedily at night under street lights or in the day -even cloudy days. Love it!,5
412057,"This is a good-quality watch and came in gift-presentable packaging. As other reviewers have noted, it is not really suitable for a small child. The face is medium to large and my husband had to remove 7 links in the band for it to fit the wrist of my skinny, just-turned-12-year-old boy. He loves it, though. So would recommend with that caveat.",4
425376,This gown was more beautiful in my hands than it was on my computer screen  I just absolutely loved it.  BUT had to return it  While I did fit into it  it was extremely tight and in risk of busting out the seams.  =(  I really truly wanted this one.,5
755739,"I ordered the teal version of this dress.  The color is a beautiful jewel tone.  I ordered the large size.  I am 5'5, 64 years old and a little portly.  The dress is not at all clingy and does not reveal my figure flaws..  I wish it were a little longer, but I am sure a more youthful person would not have this complaint. I am happy with this purchase.",5
242287,"Its great. I have a white gold band that since losing weight doesn't fit. I wanted a cheap alternative and was very glad I found this one. Its very comfortable, a little heavy, but really a very nice ring. Nobody would ever guess this wasn't white gold or platinum. Personally I love it. Highly recommend.",5
694715,"Aside from being a little snug, hat is perfect. I wear a 7 1/2 or 7 5/8. This one purchased is a 7 5/8, but feels closer to the 7 1/2. Probably just needs some wearing in time to for to my head.
Good amount of compliments on it so far",4
192197,"Ordered this for my son's 5th birthday as he is currently obsessed with The Nutcracker.  It fits and he has room to grow into it. The feather was slightly smushed down (I assume from transit), but he has no complaints and wears it nearly every day as he marches around our house declaring he is the Nutcracker King.",4
541633,"Definitely runs small. The extra large just fits over my women's size 10 sneakers. Granted, sneakers are pretty bulky. It would probably fit larger sizes for non-sneaker shoes. However, they seem fairly sturdy and watertight. I'll update the review if I have a chance to use them. I doubt they're meant for day-in, day-out use, but I plan on keeping a pair in my bag to keep my feet dry during unexpected storms.",4
92272,If you are a bigger active guy that has an issue with chaffing or upper thigh friction these are for you.  Hands down the best underwear ever! No I am not a Saxx rep. I absolutely love the way these are made with the extra material that keep your boys separated from your thighs. FREAKING AWESOME!!!!,5
556975,"I love these little studs I am using them for my second ear lobe piercing and my cartlidge I would not recommend getting the 4mm they would be to small I ordered the 6mm and it's literally a snug fit on my cartlidge. I gave the seller a 3 stars because I am going to agree with another reviewer that these are not actually 20 gauge they are closer to 18gauge maybe even a 19gauge,  but I had help putting them in my 20gauge cartlidge  piercing without a problem.",4
262894,"The bracelet itself was georgous and I was extremely satisfied with with the way it looked and shined. However, the clasp was not able to open. I see some other people have had the same problem as well. Eventually, I was able to pry it open and tamper with it a little so now it opens and closes correctly. Now there are a few little scratch marks where I had to use pliers but I'll get over it. It doesn't make sense why the company wouldn't test their product before distributing it.",2
49241,"This product worked well for 3 months and now is dead.  The motor no longer works and the return period has passed, leaving me with no idea how to receive warrantee service.  Disappointing waste of money!

Update: I did find the warrantee documentation and contacted them.  I have to pay to ship the defective unit back to them for service.  Again disappointed considering the cost of both the unit and original shipping.

I do not recommend a company that does not stand behind their products!!",1
835515,"Although I ordered 3 sizes up as was suggested in some of the review, the shirt fit a bit snuggly.  I usually wear a Lg/XL and ordered a 3X.  I think the size I received was closer to a Medium.  That being said, the shirt is super cute and I would give it five stars if the fit had been as advertised.",3
441502,"I know to buy the Allegra K clothes in larger sizes because they're made for Korean girls, however this was still very small. Additionally, it's a very chunky knit that ends up looking sloppy and uneven and it's very itchy. This will turn into a ""wear around the house"" only sweater.",2
592320,"I liked the shirt the way that it was shown on the computer before I purchased it.. The print appeared to be proportionate with the size of the shirt; however, when I received it, the image was not centered and smaller then the shirt..I will not order from CafePress again.",1
70004,"I ordered 4 of these pearl sets for my bridal party and when they arrived I was pleasantly surprised! These pearls are BEAUTIFUL!!

225945,"I absolutely love this skirt.  There was a small error that prevented the zipper from going down all the way (small stitch that came across).  I clipped and secured it and it was good to go!  I bought a knee length petty coat to wear under it to give it that extra volume and it is adorable.  I'm definitely buying more of these!!!  I'm 5'9"" and got a small (my waist is 27"") and it hits right at my knees and fit perfectly around my natural waist for reference.",5

274587,"With this one, I've gone through other brands, the buckle has bigger teeth to lock onto the belt. It is hard to clamp down but once on, it's on and doesn't fall off. Pliers will help to clamp down. Others I've tried the stupid buckle falls off after a while and once it starts failing off the only way to fix it for a while is to cut the belt and make fresh new holes. Belt and buckle look great, you can't go wrong with this purchase.",5
454304,It took forever for them to show up in mail. And size was way off way small it says plus size don't believe it ordered 2x it was more like a small .i would have sent back but I'm sure it would take 2 months to get money back not worth the time,1

It's absolutely unbelievable!  I played sports all through high school and have used other brands (Nike, Champion, Everlast, etc).  The Goddess Sport bra outperforms them all for support, comfort, endurance...etc.  The price is a bit steep, but well worth it!",5
341236,"I'm short. 5'3"". I'm plump as well. These would fit better on a taller body. The legs kind of bunch up on me by the knees. From the thighs up they fit well.

465892,"Though they were sold as an adult 1-size fits all, I couldn't pull them up past my thighs. I'm built very average, so it wasn't a weight issue. I believe they were for kids. Gave them away since it wouldnt be cost efficient to pay to ship them back for a return.",1

I purchased this pair for my newborn nephew. I'm a big Arsenal fan so I decided I had to brainwash him right away before he grows up and start liking (can't swear, sorry) clubs like Barcelona or Real Madrid. These look great on him, he is a month old and even though the size reads ''0-3 months'' sadly I don't think they are gonna fit him for more than one month. Recommended for all young Gunners ;)",5
511868,"This is a fantastic deal! If you have multiple watches, this is a life saver when changing bands!!! I bought this and the watch repair kit (like $20) and couldn't be happier.

I took the keychain off and clipped a couple of long claws on the rabbit's foot so my kitty wouldn't get scratched while playing.

Even after more than a year of wear and dozens of washes, they aren't see-through or pilly. They don't ride up or slide down. I'm 5'8, 140 lbs and I get M. Who needs designer brands when you've got these in a rainbow of colors??",5
228912,"I love this dress. The size ran a little small for me so i got a Large (I'm usually a size 6). My friend loved the dress as well so I gave the original one ( Medium )to her.
We both love it as it is such a classic style and great price.",5
180822,"I am 5'4 and 125...the large fits just fine if you want to wear a sweater underneath (the shoulders of the jacket also stick out and make me look bigger than what I am).  I am looking for a piece that is more fitted.  I am going to return and perhaps try the medium.  As far as the quality goes, I think it is goodseems sturdy.  Jackets of the same material are usually more expensive than this jacket so I think overall, this is a good deal.",5
38911,I bought these sweat pants for my boyfriend. He says they're the most comfortable sweat pants he's ever worn. The are loose fitting (on him..size large) and the waist band doesn't pinch or cut off circulation. My boyfriend would wear these every single day if he could. He was sad to have to take them off to wash them. Very soft on the inside of the pants. I will definitely be buying more soon!,5
285904,"I found this shirt to be very small compared to sizing chart. I am 5'9"" and 140 lbs and ordered a Large. It was still too small and would never work. I did like the shape and style so for the price I plan on keeping and letting a friend that is small and petite just have it.",3

Thanks for nothing",2
214940,The credit card pockets were glued/sewn slightly too small. I gad to pull apart the edges to get my id and cards in. It's a great looking wallet and the packaging it came in was unique and stylish. Just a tweek to the pockets would give it 5 stars. Maybe I got an imperfect one? The issue may not be universal?,4
517600,The dress is made of good material for the price.  This dress runs big.  I ordered a medium based on my measurements and I was swimming in it.  I would return this dress if it was not from a China seller (as the postage costs too much).  I will probably donate it to charity.,2
275104,"This is an excellent product.  I am in a weight loss program and have been using my hole punch to add holes to my old belt.  I found your belts on Amazon and ordered a black and a brown.

They are super soft and stretchy, so while it is a struggle sometimes to keep them on my 1yr old, if I can distract her immediately, she forgets they are there and will leave it on for a long time!

The little piece of fabric in front can come out, so just be aware and keep a look out for that.",5

However, The V-neck is actually rousched panels, which bunched awkwardly, and didn't quite fit right. Shame, because the royal blue color is quite lovely. Had to return, unfortunately.",3
642949,"I agree with a lot of reviews that it is too short. I'm 5'6, so not very tall...I got Blue-A9 and while it is very pretty, I cannot stand the feeling of my ankles being exposed. If it was calf length it wouldn't matter but it just looks and feels awkward. I think it also runs a bit small because I normally wear between M-L and this large is tight in the middle. I didn't have too high expectations but I still don't love it like I would if it were maxi-length.",3
325012,"The strap arrangement did not work out well on my type of suitcase because I needed to place it over where the handle pulled up to use the wheels.

I should have thought about the configuration of my suitcase before ordering.",3

I did need to tighten it a little like others did, but I expected that. I used the same ring-closing pliers that I use for my other body jewelry.

It's definitely surgical steel, too. I've had no irritation.

I totally freaked out my friends and parents for April fools day :D",5
39303,"Recently bought 2 pair of these on Amazon. I like the fit and feel, but the quality of construction is poor. On both pair, after only a couple of washings, the stitching in the waistband started to unravel. I cut the loose threads and used fabric glue on those spots to keep them from unraveling further. But the fact that this happened on two different pair indicates either poor quality control, or the just make them with no concern for solid stitching.",3
377989,The picture of the item looks a lot longer on the model than I got. It's very short and an XL is a size small. Material is very thin. It would be like something I could've paid a $1 for. I didn't know  to return it I had to ship it back to China. I'll be paying more to ship it than I had paid for it. Not worth it!,1

The ribbed knit and double liner in the crotch kept my drier and comfortable.  Hanes has changed the material and sizing. They have done away with the ribbing in the knit, and the material is much thinner. The deal breaker for me, though, is that after the first washing, they shrink and will no longer fit properly!  Don't buy them.",1
259511,I bought this for the summer. It's a cute and sawesome suit but the stitching is horrible the bottoms are coming apart already... Luckily I sew so I can fix it myself but if you cant I wouldn't recommend taking the risk.. Money worth spent on a scare from 1-10? Probably a 6,3

264541,I love the color and silhouette but the material is thin and doesn't look super great on me. My stomach isn't entirely flat so now I have to work on losing a few before Halloween. I'm sure this would look good on a size 2 though. I'm a size 6.,3
798552,The fit of this bathing suit was super weird. The top was a little big and the bottom was wayyyy to small. I am normally a medium but ordered a size large based on comments/suggestions and the bottom of this bikini was just TINY. I loved the style and the print of the fabric but there was just no way this was going to look flattering on me.,2
274736,"These ratchet belts are awesome!  My husband is always between sizes it seems and this belt can adjust perfectly to whatever size he is.  I started with the black one for him and he loved it so much I bought this  one, too. He's owned them for several months, wears them every day, and they're holding up beautifully.  I will absolutely buy these again in the future.",5
138271,"This dress fit as expected! Very form fitting and conforms to your body. Perfect conservative length which fell just below my knees. I am 5'7"" 163 lbs and I ordered the uk 12/14. I have the cream, black, and purple. The purple is not as pictured but more of a dark plum. Still very nice for the fall winter months. All is needed is accessories to make the perfect outfit.",5
283153,"First bikini I've confidently worn in decades. I'm 5'6"" and 160. I wear a size 8 sometimes a 10 and ordered the 2XL. Bottoms are perfect. The top looks good but would fit a smaller bust better. I'm a 36DD and the top is a bit small. Love this suit.",5
65219,"I love them.. no piece was damaged or duplicated. They looked exactly like I imaged them to look. Can't wait to get my tongue reported so I can try these. Bad boys on..
Thank you for thesw wonderful works of art. I will definitely buy from you again in the near future",5
829855,"I love this shirt. SUPER cute and comfortable.  I am 5' 4"", 120 pounds and bought a large.  When I first wore it I thought it was too big and slightly long.  However I washed it and dried it on delicate.  It shrank slightly now it fits perfectly.  I've warn and washed it maybe 4 times now and it's holding up fine.",5
573632,"I was so excited to get this scarf, I knew the color would vary, and I was fine with that, however, the scarf, shown in the pictures, and what i received, seems to be about 14 - 18"" difference in length.  Mine is extremely short, and don't think i will even be able to wrap it around my neck, what a disappointment.",1
401595,"Bought these for my husband for work.  He is hard on sunglasses, so I don't like to spend too much money for them.  These have held up well, all except the rubber padding on the nose rests - don't think that you really need them though.  They are light weight and comfortable - a good buy.",4
792007,"The only reason why I'm giving this dress 3 stars in because it looks nothing like the picture and is completely see through at the top and on the bottom. However, the dress I received does have very cute colors (there are more purples and dark corals) and fits me perfect! I'm only 4'11"" so it's tough to find maxi dresses that don't drag on the ground and this one doesn't.",3
743572,"Our friend brought T shirts for our grandsons on a trip to Tanzania, and bought a very nice gift for our granddaughter also.
But it was not a T shirt. So we were happy to be able to order a Tanzania shirt for her via Amazon.  The quality is good, and the shirt is attractive. Good value for the price, and prompt shipping.",5
281113,"It is a slim fit, so take that into account. I'm a decently curvy girl, so I'm glad I sized up. The fabric is lightweight and comfortable, and it wicks moisture very well. The sleeves are nice and long, too long for me but perfect if you're long-limbed. Overall, very nice. I received this item in exchange for an honest review.",5
406926,"I got these for my husband after having a pair for at least a year.  I love mine and have had no problems.  However, when his fell off the dining room table one of the lenses came out.  He popped it back in and they are so far, so good.  The lenses really permit a sharp image, although I prefer a lighter tint.",3
737210,There was some early wear and tear but nothing I couldn't repair myself. This bag is amazing! It has alot of pockets that are convenient to get to and so much storage. I was worried it would be to big for short trips but its not at all. There is a bottom compartment that can actually be opened up or closed off inside. I use that space for my camera gear and it helps cause I can fit my trip pod in the pack as well.,4
398466,Before Tamagotchi v2 came out I played with the japanese keitai which is the american v2. Although v2 was fun I enjoyed the japanese version much better. The japanese has better games and better codes to use. I didn't have much fun with the games in v2. So thats my only complaint but overall v2 was ok. The japanese is just better in my opinion.,4
207813,"Took foreeever to receive but I am satisfied with my purchase. It came all crunched up in just plastic so it was a little malformed coming out of the packaging. It is somewhat smaller than I thought, glad I don't have a big head. Stitching is good and lettering nice. Great for the price.",3
338377,"I love this dress! I am normally an 18 so I ordered an 18, which was a mistake ... I could have gone for a 16 if not a 14. I have washed and dried this dress, hoping it would shrink. It barely did. So I'll wear it as is for now but will be ordering another color in a 14 ... I love the feel of it, super comfy and flattering",5
396791,"I followed the directions on the size chart and was still very disappointed to find that the bathing suit didn't fit. At all. The bathing suit was too small and the tanking was too large. It wasn't a good fit. I will be returning. Btw I'm your average 5'4 130lb regular runner and I ordered a medium. The large may have fit but the tankini would have been a sheet- if the medium was too large. Also, the bathing suit is more of a micro bikini. The tankini is a fitted shirt in bathing suit material.",2

***** edit: My girls have only been wearing their rings for two months. They've turned solid black. I have a sterling silver polishing cloth that works on all my silver jewelry. It doesn't work on these. The rings remain black. They must not be Sterling?? Very disappointed. If the price seems too good to be true, it probably is. I hate wasting money, even if it's a small amount. :(",1

553713,"These hats are very cute and stylish for the price and the material they are made of is very soft, light and breathable.  My girls don't usually like hats but they don't mind wearing these. They are noy necessarily warm enough for the winter months but perfect for warm summer days. We bought them for our 4 month old preemie twins and they still fit just fine, 3 months later.
I definitely recommend these hats for chic babies!",5
402136,"I had added this to my Amazon wish list, and it's another of the items my husband bought me for Christmas.  It's a bit lighter in weight than I expected, though I did expect it to be small in size.  I wanted this as a pinky ring, and so a size 4 is perfect for my little hands and does not overwhelm them at all.  I have a problem with many rings being too large and making me look like I'm a little girl playing dress-up in my mother's jewelry.  :)

Good quality, great price.",4
9466,"i returned it. it was big and wide for female feet and the color was little different from the picture. not as expected.
Vendor deduct $10 something from the original amount that i didn't know prior to ordering the shoes.  i paid for shipping back ($10) and lost $10 for re-stocking fee or something.  I will not order anything unless i know the product 100%.",3
87678,"Shipping was pretty quick for this item, considering how far away it came from. Basically, you get what you pay for. Material is very cheap, looks costume-y to me. Not crazy about the placement of the bow and the way it hangs. Dress is a little short. I haven't decided if I'll wear this dress or not. I will be using my own belt if I do. I'm a busty size 0 and the dress fit fine except a little tight up top. I'd say pass if I had the choice to purchase again.",2
574578,"Feels like linen, but I'm not an expert. I usually wear a women's 10/12 or a US Men's S/M, but after reading the reviews I sized up to an XL. I definitely could've fit an L, but I was hoping for a relaxed fit so this is perfect. This shirt is soft but very sheer; regardless of gender you'll probably want an undershirt. It seems like it's good quality, especially the buttons and seam.",4
370406,"The fit is perfect.  The color is beautiful!  I returned the first pair and then reordered another pair.  When I received the second order,  on the right front pant leg, there was a light greyish-black area. I rubbed the pant leg together and it seems to have mostly disappeared.  I will check this when I wear them the first time.",3
840564,"I liked the style of it, but the material was very thin and cheap-looking. I returned the grey one and got the white one instead. It was also a lot larger than I expected. I usually wear a size large for shirts because I like things to fit a little baggy, but after reading reviews, I decided to get the medium. It was still pretty large and the slit in the side goes up waaaay higher than I would've liked. Again, I ordered the grey and disliked the material, but I really like the white one.",3
880925,"i was terrible disappointed with the quality of this shirt.....We could not wait to give it to my son who will be attending Boston University in the fall, sadly our enthusiasm fell into disappointment and regret.  We should have ordered it directly from the college....Sometimes you get what you pay for or sometimes you just get taken for.....",1
759532,So sad. I was excited for this. I normally wear a small and sometimes a medium for a loose fit. I ordered a size up as suggested from other reviews. (Large) I think I t is what I would call an xs or even smaller. Way to small for me.,1
72605,"Excellent deal. I researched a few rings and decided on this one. We actually went to a few jewerly stores around town and located this exact ring. They wanted over $350 dollars for the ring. Found on Amazon, ordered it, then went back to the store to compare. It was literally the exact same ring. Thanks for saving me a ton Amazon...",5
669282,"This top is poorly made. (crooked seams) It is also way way too small. The cuffs on the sleeves are so tight that you can't move, and the back curves under your butt in a very unflattering way. The size large would fit someone who wears a 2 or maybe a 4.",1

I ordered a Medium black and blue, I'm 5 ft, 3 in, and 130 pounds, and wanted a slightly oversized look and this works. the sleeves seem a tink short so I couldn't wear a small I think. There are two ties in the back with a weird slit, I just cut the ties off since they look a little funny back there just swinging.",3

Maybe I can find a way to tie it snug enough for my daughter to take her boots on and off at preschool. She likes the boots, seem very warm. She will wear these come november in New England!",4
646639,"Very Pretty! A little larger than expected, but isn't it usually the other way around? I think it would look very flattering on a girl's / ladies hair pulled back on a more formal occasion. Since I don't attend many of those anymore, I believe I'll save it for a younger ladies gift.  It's just as pretty as pictured.",4
780214,"I'm 5ft 1inch and 130 lbs, I ordered a large to fit my D cup boobs. It shows a lot of cleavage and I would recommend someone who is busty to order an XL. This suit is made very short so if you are tall you should go with 2 sizes larger. I usually wear small/medium clothes and a 27 in jeans. This suits fits snug in a large showing everything so if you are not comfortable with that this is not for you.",4
627170,Should've ordered a M. Chose to order a L due to Asian clothes running smaller. It is decent quality. Not really a dress to wear out but if you do it the right way it might be possible. I'm using it to wear under see thru dresses it will work for that purpose.,4
296469,"Super comfortable and fit my small feet perfectly. I have flat feet so a lot of shoes are not comfortable for long periods of time. I can wear the shoe all day long and they are super comfortable. They are light colored so any dirt will be seen right away, but they are easy to clean compared to other shoes Ive had. Would definitely buy another pair in a different color.",5
245197,"GET these!  They are decently constructed -- not too flimsy, not incredibly well-made.  I say you get what you paid for.  We're taking these on our first Disney vacation!  Woot!  Oh, and perfect fit for a child -- might be too small for a big-head adult but I plan on wearing some ears!",5
758721,"My kid wears size 4 in Adidas soccer cleats. The Dream Pairs size 4 is probably a size to size and a half too large. I kept the large pair for future and ordered a size smaller. These still fit a little large. I like that they can be worn inside school, but still provide good traction on grass",3

It fits very snug but doesn't look too tight or feel uncomfortable,  and it looks great! It's very stylish when zipped up to the neck. I have received lots of compliments on it.",5
218484,"It's cute and I really wish it fit me. The description listed the size I purchased would fit a woman's 14. I think this would actually fit a woman's size 10 at best. The color is nice, the fabric is good quality and the construction is better than I expected. It's too bad I can't wear it.",3
178146,"this is def not a size large but the reviews said it runs small so i ordered 2 sizes up and it fits me (5.3, 115 lbs). a large is a small. the button hole was sewn shut???? the shorts are size large and the belt a size xl. no biggie just weird. but over all it came extra early and it does fit. the button is a quick fix but ANNOYING!!!!",3
252650,I bought it to take to my barre classes. I found myself still sliding around the carpet. It is still a pretty good deal. I don't think that it's worse quality than the pure barre socks-so you might as well save your money and buy this. The individual toes make it kind of a hassle to put on before class.,3
804191,"Cheap in quality but fine for the price. I love the bottoms for coverage, but they do roll up when swimming. The top is HUGE. I ordered a small and the bottoms fit like a medium, and the top like an XL. I couldn't use the top at all. The print is really cute.",3

Good price and nice quality.",5

That didn't make me happy, but when the mannequin decorated with Christmas greenery, lights and ornaments it will make me happy!",5
172084,"Fell in love with it right away online and especially when I laid eyes on it. I've always loved the sleek, crisp look of a briefcase and never favored the ""baggy"" look of purses. It has plenty of little pouches in it for lip gloss and your phone as well as being long enough for a large credit card wallet. This is a little bit of a dressy purse so it would be ideal for a professional women. I love this purse.",5
371883,"Good quality one piece bathing suit. Very nice, but the torso is very short. If you don't have a large chest or if you are tall and have a long torso, this will not fit correctly. Fit well as far as plus size is concerned, but torso needs to be a few inches longer.",3

I don't even need to try them on to tell that the second I do any type of stretching in these that you will be able to see my butt through these.

I found itchy plastic threads in them and can't wear a pair more than a few minutes before they itch too horribly to stand. Merino wool is supposed to be soft and comfortable. These are not quality socks. Don't waste your money!",1

I got so so so so many compliments on this necklace! It really took a simple black wrap dress up several notches! I like quirky jewlery and was not disappointed by this! It layed flat on my chest, it didn't flip and turn back wards and the dinosaur even has itty bitty hands! Really, go buy this. You wil NOT be disappointed!",5
203051,If your like me and have many credit cards this product is for you. So far it has worked out for me great. The only thing I didn't care for is the felt cover. I personally would of liked something more eye catching like leather or a designed cover but overall its pretty good for what I needed it for.,4

167335,so if these are coming from a seller by the name of LYaa DO NOT BUY THEM!!!! These ARE NOT 90 degree yoga workout pants that i just got in the mail. these are leggings that you would get at a store like forever 21 except they are thinner and not even close to the picture! total false advertising! I love this brand and was so excited to get these,1
32564,"I *love* these boots and am now on my 3rd pair. They fit my rather thin calves perfectly (most boots are too wide), but are a bit stretchy to fit larger calves too. The heel and platforms heights are perfect. They are a little tight around the toes when I first put them on, but after wearing them around for a while I don't notice it much. I love wearing these with jeans and tank tops or a cute short dress.",5
351079,"I am incredibly impressed with this dress! I literally pulled it out of my mailbox maybe 20 minutes ago, and I am already on here to buy new colors. It is a little bit thin, but that is to be expected with the price. Other than that, the pattern is beautiful, and it fits like a glove. I have a long torso, so I have a hard time finding dresses that are long enough on me. The stress is perfect. Hits me just above the knees. I highly recommend it and will be definitely buying more",5

She has rather small feet so this might not be the shoe for her, saddly. We love Minnetonka in this house so we will continue to buy them just maybe not thier baby shoes.
Also kind of annoying to lace up.",4

I was searching for a cheap, comfortable shirt just to kick around in while on vacation and received a high quality bargain. I will be ordering mire of these. I love the color and style.

Can't wait to wear it to my part :)",4

594684,This is a very high quality piece. The pattern is beautiful and the color is amazing. It seems to run short as some of the other reviewers said. Would absolutely LOVE it if it was longer. But is still a sexy gown and Honeystore customer service is the best I've seen in a LONG time.,5
695644,"I wear a size 2-4 and am 5' 4"" and I ordered a size 4.  Overall it fits very well.  It is long but nothing a pair of high heels won't fix.  I would recommend this dress, it's very beautiful and I can't believe I got it for this prices.",5

Time will tell whether they can stand up to baggage handlers, but I am very optimistic...they can bend where others will break.  Note: you need to write your name/address into the fields and you cannot use a business card. Not a big issue, but something to keep in mind. I recommend throwing your business card inside the luggage anyway.  Excellent instructions on how to attach/detach the lanyard attaching the tag to your baggage.",5

Baby is well into 6-9 mo onesies and can still wear the 9-12 month of this pu although has outgrown that size in carters and grrber. Also I like that they are thick since we put her in there plus a cotton sleep sack to sleep.,5

The originals have withstood 10+ camping/backpacking/climbing trips and numerous days of regular wear as well. They have stretched only a little (to my body shape) but have otherwise remained dark black and sans holes. Buy a pair of these and save yourself the $$$ on those $100 leggings. These are easily worth the money, and if you're short like me, they'll fit like regular-length leggings!!",5

I'm 5' 8"" and curvy, because of that I expected it wouldn't fit me properly or I wouldn't be able to zip it closed. I was wrong! It is flattering and I can easily zip it closed though I doubt I will do that often. Great basic blazer for the price and great color.",5

I have an 11 month old who weighs 18 lbs and is very petite and this is too small. It is fine on the length, but the width is too narrow. It was a struggle to put it over her shoulders. The seam is coming undone already so now i'm gonna have to fix the stitching.",2

She is large chested so if you don't have a chest it may fit a bit loose, but just measure. The seamstress we use was able to just tack up the length on the front so we could resale or rent later.",5

368034,"I received an XL and while it did help that the Velcro closure at the waist as about 3-4 inches long, the skirt had just enough fabric to wrap around my 38-inch waist. Skirt is very short made with very soft fabric; great for bedroom play but NOT for a Halloween or costume party--unless it's one of ""those"" parties!",3
825797,The size chart was off.  I sized it  to fit but actually needed 2 size smaller to get the sleek tight feel. The material is sturdy.  I wear it around the house.  Haven't graduated to wearing it out.  To me it suits it's purpose.  I find that I eat less and am starting to get more of an hourglass shape. Have been using it for a month. Great customer service!,4

Hed been wearing a stainless steel band for the last few years.  This white tungsten band just looks so much better. It has the look of platinum, and it feels very hefty.  The comfort-fit interior makes it go on easily.  Highly recommended!",5
771741,These dresses were perfect. Made my day perfect. They fit just as expected. As a matter of fact I presented the bigger sizes in junior thinking they would be too small and if I would have ordered the size on the dot they would have been wonderful. For the little girls sizes they were right on.,5
401431,"The package came in a very timely manner. Their customer service is also on top of their game. I had emailed a question and they responded in less the 12 hours. And I called them to ask another question and the jewelry customer service person was excellent. Thank you Very much, i will be getting more items from you in the future.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/0-Gauge-Organic-Horn-Spiral/dp/B000O81M50/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">0 Gauge Organic Horn Spiral</a>",5
406268,This item is neither well made nor well constructed. The stitching on the top corner is half the size of the stitching on the bottom corner. the stitching around the emblem is off-center and messy. There is glue(?) on the upper corner than can not be removed. The emblem is recessed on the left side and protruding on the right side. Ugh! This was supposed to be a fathers' day gift - but it is too poorly made to give as a gift. The leather is nice but it doesn't compensate for the poor construction. I'm sending it back.,2
76839,"Great shades, everything outside brighter in color, great for driving or doing any activity outdoors that require visual focus. A lot of sunglasses look cool but are too dark to look thru, these are very clear. But note they are plastic and lite weight, so they must be handled with kids gloves if you want to keep them for awhile. I leave mine in car for driving use only. Good buy.",5
107746,"This was incredibly frustrating since I bought a pair of boots to go with it, and by the time I received the wrong costume it was too late to exchange it for the correct one. Always use caution when purchasing clothing items online (especially if you're on a tight schedule). The customer service was good, however, and they did try to work with me; there just wasn't enough time.",1
610861,"Ordered this shirt as a gift. It came in time but I was disappointed with the print. It looks faded and grainy. I was expecting it to look like the picture listed with the product description. I guess it will have to do.
Update: I was refunded after contacting the seller.",3
163340,"These were really great and the colors are nice and bright.  The fastener on one of them broke after two wears, though, so that's why it lost a star.  I used this for a costume for a play, so I was able to just sew the garter to the sock and use it throughout the run of the show.  They fit well and stay up for hours and hours of dancing and running around.  They hand wash really well and the colors don't run.",4
418821,"This is a great bag. Lots of room inside and lots of pockets for organizing. My co-workers were jealous of my bad and kept asking me where I got it from. The only issue I had with this bag was the seller folded the bad for packing and shipping. Unfortunately, doing this caused my bad to have a crease in it which drove me crazy. Other than that, happy with this purchase.",4
281820,"They fit great! I definitely recommend them! I'm a very tiny girl (about 100 lbs and 5'7"") so finding pants that fit is a very difficult task but these actually fit without being baggy! They also had enough stretch that if I were larger they would still fit and hug my body without being overly tight!",5
651249,"Got two of these. One for my cousins granddaughter and one for her grandson. They love them. EVERY CHILD should own a few patriotic shirts so they can have them for Presidents Day, Memorial Day, Veterans Day, Fourth of July, and so on. If you are American, than show your pride.",5
181724,"Shipping was incredibly fast! And the shine on the ring is tremendous! It fit my husband perfectly and he really loves it! Thank you for an amazing product!

UPDATE:
So far, my husband has had this ring for 3 months and hasn't taken it off. There are literally NO scratches on the ring which I find to be unbelievable with how he treats it's. It looks just as new as ever and I'm so glad we took a chance on this ring!",5
878391,"Really cool pants. I LOVE the wine color- but the thighs are just a little too tight for me. I have soccer-player thighs and always have a hard time finding something that fits my waist AND thighs... and this was no exception. Very cool, and water resistant, but I couldn't see myself hiking all day in them comfortably.",4
808635,I bought this dress and got something that looked similar to the dress but was not the same. I did not receive a belt and the seam around the waist was crooked. To sum it all up this dress simply looked cheap and I will not be purchasing a new one.,1
314739,My hubby and I love date nights - and I love surprising him with new outfits.... This might just be one of his favorites. I'm not model thin and of course have my own body issues like most woman - but as a 165 lb size 9/10.... I felt sexy in this!!! hid my fluffy rolls and showed off his favorite parts of me.... haha,5
411690,"I bought this to be Miss Kay for Halloween. When it got here the first thing I did was put it on and see how much to cut off. I took it off and cut it where I needed to. It was perfect, and I must say it stayed on very well with a wig cap under it. Everyone wanted to know where I got my Miss Kay wig! ( My husband was Phil, we are in our early 60's so we could pull it off )",4
862478,"My daughter turned two a couple of weeks ago and was already having a hard time fitting into T2 size shirts.  We ordered some size T3, and at the rate any kid is growing I think this is a good option.  It is a simple t-shirt I do not have to worry about her getting dirty or what it can match with.  She wore it the day it arrived too.",4
802303,"I was aware that these were going to be Asian sizing so i ordered an XL in both the black and red. I wear a size M normally and the XL will fit like an american M. However, the items I received are NOT what are pictured.

The black Shirt has a cream colored reindeer on it with a red nose. Not Gold. Not glittery. Cream.

The red shirt has a gold deer but the deer is just gold. Its not glittery.",1
757357,"Cute suit but didn't fit me. I ordered the 5X or size 16 which is what I normally wear. The bottoms fit mostly but the top was so padded I doubt it could hold a C cup, let alone my DDDs. The orange of the flowers is like a neon bright orange which is cute just wasn't what I was expecting based on the pic.",3
318803,"If it's too good to be true, it probably is. These are fake Ray-Bans and it's obvious. Right from the box you can tell. The box has an unclean finish. The printed Ray-ban logo looked cheap like you can scratch it off. The glasses just feel really cheap. The frame is supposed to be. a matte black but it is more of a cheap shiny plastic. Don't waste your money",1
288387,After reading reviews that said to go a size up i did just that and was very disappointed... they were too big! I love the colours and the material. The fact that they are not see-through is great. i don't usually wear these type of legging. I reorder them and got some more with my correct size if u are a medium buy medium,3
796510,"I had to make it almost as large s it would go to make it fit. So much so that the back is sticking out of the spot it goes into on the cloth part of the hat. But except for that I like it. It is a nice, well made hat.",4
175523,"I LOVE this costume.  It fit great, really well made.  It runs long which is good because I am tall.  I just left it on dragging on the ground.  I ordered late and they were able to get it to me on time!  A real fab job- thank you!",5
395946,"This is a top quality snowsuit, bought for our little one year old grandson. I love that the sleeves and legs can be flipped over to cover the hands and feet for warmth. The only improvement I would recommend is the neck and hood. Hard to zip it all the way up with a little one. It would be great if there were a tab instead, something soft that could secure the neck area and bring the hood together more.

But I love the appearance of this and the warmth. So cute!",5
187678,"I bought this product and was really sad it didn't fit, which was my fault because i thought ""one size"" meant fits all. So i put in a request with the company for a return and instead they offered to send me one in a different size. Great service. Adorable skirt too. Thanks!",4
678896,"These boots are BEAUTIFUL!! Im 5'10"" and the boots came about two inches below my knee, which I love. The calf width was perfect to wear over jeans or leggings with thick socks. I wear a 9 and ordered that size and they still fit with good socks. The material feels like real leather and is good quality. I would order these boots again.",5
680432,"This skirt is just what I wanted! Being a huge LOTR dork while also maintaining a decent level of fashion, I wanted something I could casually wear out. :) I'm petite, 5'2"" 118lbs, and this fit very nicely, short but not too short. The material is a little shinier than I thought it would be, very polyester-like, but it's not gaudy. It's also a bit thin, but not see-through, so if you're looking for something sturdy this might not be the skirt for you. I love it.",5
76391,"I was excited to order this in hopes that I wouldn't have to purchase maternity pants! However, I was very disappointed. I am a size 8/10, so I ordered a size 2 (based on the size chart on BellaBand's website). Unfortunately, the band does not hold up my jeans at all. Any time I bend over, the back side of my jeans slide down, defeating the entire purpose of the BellaBand. Perhaps I should have ordered a size smaller?",3
100970,"I have tried several boxer briefs and these are BY FAR the best.  Nice fit, stays cool and I really like the pocket in front to keep your junk organized even when the material relaxes a bit during the day.  I tried these for about a month and liked it so much I reordered more.  Don't waste your time with other companies.",5
349233,You have to be careful wearing this piece. The Opel can pop out is not securely placed it every single time you get one. I bought two and 1 the to the opals popped off . Other than that the pieces beautiful well constructed. It is a tad heavy but that should be expected with having a gemstone in it.,4
487951,"These earrings are beautiful with an antique feel. They are less costly. However, I can't say too much more about them because I don't have them in my possession. These earrings takes a month to arrive. Since then I have found many local places that sell earrings just as beautiful for less.",3
699461,"I am the biggest BTS fan ever and when I saw this sweatshirt I had to have it! I got it within the expected day which is great but when I put it on, it was a little smaller than I expected. I'm on the smaller side of girls so the fit isn't uncomfortable!
If you are going to buy this I would suggest you buy it a size larger than you normally buy for sweatshirts :)",4
780110,"! WoW ! See Photo...
You need to order a SIZE UP, don't believe check the inches if you need an XL see inches and they are for a L......
These shirts look good & feel good too but are SUPER THIN. In one photo I took a picture through the shirt. Five Stars if they were thicker  and right inches in size.",4
104079,After reading the reviewsi was worried about it being huge but it was just large enough for what I was wanting (didn't want to carry and extra diaper bag). Didn't have weird smell or anything. The only thing is that the inlay has started to come apart from when I got it in December and it's February now.  Still love the bag though.,3
429367,"I was wanting to buy a hematite bracelet to see if it would really help with my health. Hey. Don't laugh. I'm willing to try anything at this point. lol. Some people actually believe it works.  Anywho, back on track. It's not hematite. I am still going to keep it because it is pretty and fits nicely.  But if you want a hematite bracelet/anklet, this is not it.",3
366079,"I ordered a small and a medium and was sent a medium and a large. I know how to order the right size and do not need to be sent a size larger. It was cheaply made and as soon as I put the top together the hinge that was sewn on broke. Extremely poor quality, sized wrong and I was sent the wrong size.",1
321642,"Yesterday I had left a one star rating since I did not receive the converters even though delivery was confirmed. However, today they appeared in my mailbox...a week after confirmed delivery. My guess the package went to neighbor? So I am returning here to rate/review the product....good product! It does as it states in description.",5
837333,"I'm 5'4, 130 lbs and when I got the dress in the mail I was a little disappointed because it was a little long/big on me. I got a medium after reading the comments. I ran it through the washer and dryer to see if shrinking it a bit would work and it did! It's the perfect length now. I recommend buying a size up and washing/drying if you need to. There was also a pretty big hole on the ride side seam, but overall happy with the dress.",4
338413,"Very cute and fit exactly as expected.  I'm 5'3'"" and the length was perfect (grazing ankle).  I ordered the ""coffee 16"" and it's a true size 16, (with a little bit to spare), which makes it nice when moving around, kneeling, etc..  Total teacher outfit,and perfect for teaching Kindergarten!",5
324365,"Nice quality, heavyweight cotton. Color as shown. Arm holes drop down quite a bit, but I read that in advance and plan on wearing a sports bra under it anyway. It is a little snug-fitting, but that just encourages me to workout more so it will fit better!  I admit I like Colortone's tie-dye shirts more. Package arrived at the end of the delivery window so not late; I've been spoiled by most things from Amazon vendors arriving earlier than expected!  5 stars for packaging, delivery, and item as expected.",5
660747,"It's ok for the price. Make sure to order size up because if you want it to fit somewhat like the model in the picture, you need to go size up. Or two. Heh. I'm 5'5 and 120lbs, ordered a Large and it looks kinda like the model in the picture. Sleeves aren't as long. Just remember, this is from China and don't expect perfection for 10$. But nevertheless I'm satisfied with what I received.",4
712564,"I love the print and it's super brights and cute! I am pear shaped so my thighs and booty are obvs bigger than my waist and chest. so while it fit perfectly everywhere else, the breast area fit me a bit big but taking out the underwire helped to make the cup fit. I am 5'4 ,185 lbs 36b. For reference.",4
646774,After a while they hurt my kids feet. Both my son and daughter have them and they both had the heels dog in. You can't adjust some areas (like the heel) and it makes it run their feet in a odd way and they had blisters. The price was right but I ended up throwing them away because it caused blisters.,1
797701,Honestly the swimsuit I received looks absolutely NOTHING like the images... The bottoms are WAY TOO SMALL so I had to give them away but the top seems okay... I have worn it before and it is good quality but it makes your breast look saggy..... I don't recommend buying this and I would rather spend a little more money on a better swimsuit!!!!,2
284310,"Came very quickly, but gauge was bigger then expected. I ordered 14g But it was more like a 10g. My original lip ring could go into the push top. That's how much wider it was. The sad part is that it was EXACTLY what I wanted. I'd probably say it's cut bigger. Would need an 18g.",3
555911,"I have received more compliments on this necklace!  I will definitely be buying more in various colors.  Excellent quality.  Absolutely beautiful.  Price is very economical.  I do tie the necklace at the pendant because it tends to turn on my neck allowing the chain to show,  but it is still plenty long and absolutely stunning!",5
72142,"Even though he's 10, he still loves crocs. According to him, they are the most comfortabl shoes on the planet. I have to admit, they go everywhere and are really easy to clean.  I'm a Birkenstock lover myself, so I guess this is the younger generation equivalent of Birks. Maybe not the most attractive shoe, but comfort and functionality are what matters. And as crocs go, these look much more stylish than the plain single color version.",5
642826,"I had a negative experience.

The frames were too large, a problem that could have been avoided if proper measurements were taken prior to.  They also possessed a height that reflected the 80's era, an old fashion appearance, as opposed to a more modern, sleek, elegance the reviews might have suggested.

Nevertheless, the merchant was not Amazon & therefore charged a return fee without supplying a return label.  It was near half the cost of the frames so I elected to keep them.  It was a stressful transaction.",1
461124,"I know these are no longer made, but my 17 year old son loves this model and we found some in his size (12).  He has wide feet and is a goalkeeper, so these are very comfortable and sturdy for his needs, and the leather is very nice.  Glad he could find them.",5
407362,"Ordered a PINK cap for my wife.  When it arrived it was on time but despite the label on the packaging it was a non-official blue (not Honolulu blue), the LED setup is bulky and clunky making it a little weird to wear.  The material is thick so it's not good for a sports bar that gets warm either.  It was only 12 bucks so.. Meh.",2
269385,Very fitting. If you don't want it to show every curve don't choose these in your exact size. I how ever bought them to be tight and sexy.  Even after a couple of washes they still fit perfectly not to tight but not loose to where it you move the wrong way you show all or your butt falls out love these shorts. I'm a size 9 in juniors and small for perfect.,5
511498,"Not what I expected at all. Thought it would be a super cute, pretty stylish top. I bought this a year or so ago, and I've never worn it. It's cheap and pretentious. The sleeves might look cute in the picture but they look really bad in real life. Waste of money.",3
252403,"Nice size, excellent quality which Travelon is noted for. Plus their 1 year warranty which I know from experience they will stand behind! I really like safety of RFID, color is a rich brown and stitching is a nice bright accent. Lots of room inside and it zips all around the outside for added security.",5
64905,"I love my Wabbits feet! I gave several to friends and they were tickled silly! I have them on my key chain and show them to everyone. They may think you are a kook but too bad, I have much fun and enjoyment from my Rabbits Foot. Laugh alittle, buy them for your kids and everyone else!",5
407155,Well my wife is a size 16 only because she has some junk in her trunk and of-course I love it but when she tells me she is happy with what I get here that has to a great product. She says the fit well the way she likes and there is no gap. So We will give these jeans 5 stars and the price is great compared to baby phat or other brand names.,5
597392,"Awesome stickers! They are the cutest blue rhinestones. Definitely high quality and classy! The is the something blue my daughter in law will wear in her wedding. They come packaged well and are ready to be put on the shoes. They go great with the MR ""Me Too"" stickers. These are going to make the perfect wedding picture even though they are going on converse instead of heels! Perfect addition to any wedding!",5
295584,"Well well, this dress is Fabulous.  I was a complete show stopper.  Fit every curve and it was super long.  I want this in yellow.  Please make a bright yellow.  I got so many compliments.  I went to a gala.  I am 5'8 and weigh 152 lbs.  Super long.  My best friend loved it so much she order one yesterday.  I will add a photo shortly.",5
605111,I ordered a little bit bigger as last year we ordered one online from a different seller exactly to her measurements and it was quite tight. With Jaeden i could have ordered her measurements exactly and it would have been perfect.  Love this seller and they were a pleasure to do business.  Would highly recommend them.  The gown is beautiful.,5
424003,"Thank you for one sexy cool corset top. I ordered one and it got lost somehow,but the company sent another ASAP and I am a loyal customer from now on. The top fits perfect you could tie it up or down. I'm 5'7"" 200 and the close fit nicely. Like I said you could loosen it or tie it smaller but it's sexy cool. A head turner",5
791137,"I got a small and it fit perfect. Am 5' 6"", 124 lbs, D-cup.  It has some soft sponginess to it, but still thin and tight enough to wear under clothes.  I really like the material.  It will not stop wind at all, so be aware.  But very breathable.  The bottoms were perfect. Not too short.  Didn't cut into midsection. Very comfy.  The top could have had longer sleeves and a bit longer torso length, but it will work.
 All in all I am happy with the quality and comfort.",5
862868,I ordered this shirt a size bigger than what I needed which means im a medium but I ordered a large. It came in the mail way earlier than expected but it came in a super small size that fits way too tight even though it was a large but other than that It looks the same as in the photo and has a good fabric. I highly recommend that if you do buy this shirt that you be aware of the size and buy 1 or 2 sizes up from your regular size.,2
24536,"This is great! Rugged and durable. Fortunately, it does NOT have that grey Alpha patch shown in the picture.  Despite having ""Alpha industries USA"" on multiple labels, it is made in China.  That was disappointing, but it's still a great jacket. Two inner breast pockets; one has a zipper.  It's pretty warm even without the zip in liner.  It fits big. I'm 6ft, 190lb, and a medium fits just like I like it, with plenty of room. But I could probably even wear a small comfortably.",4
175489,This hoodie is perfect! We got it for our son to wear under his jersey at hockey games. I wear him in a wrap so I didn't want him to overheat. He is 4 months old but he his long and skinny so I got a 6 month size. The sleeves fit perfectly. Picture is included of my son in the hoodie.,5
365914,"I bought this jewelry for my daith piercing and was impressed when I received them.  They were very pretty and looked durable.  After I put it in, though, it didn't take too long before I started feeling some discomfort and noticed that my ear was turning my ear green.  Very disappointed.",2
149481,"This is not a shawl, its just a basic scarf.  It isn't even that big.  The colors are also deceptive, they aren't muted but very primary looking.  The biggest issue I had though was the size; it looks like a proper large scarf on the model but its a small scarf, almost the size of a mens scarf.  It also took over 6 weeks to come.",1
29004,"These insoles are better than my insoles specially design by a medical professional that cost $200.  I have Planar fasciitis and these insoles really help. At first they seem to be to high an arch, but I have learned that that is what I need to eliminate the pain in my heel.  They do however have to be replaced about every 4-6 months as they develop wear spots.",5
525903,"This item shipped quickly and arrived with a packing slip.  I confess it does not look as good on me as it does on the model! It's a tad tight across the bust. If it shrinks, I'll be out a new shirt. If I manage to lose 10 pounds we'll be in like Flynn! Very good material and well-made. I'm 5'8"" and weigh 160 pounds. I ordered a size Med.",4
778756,"This is not an authentic Baseballism shirt. It is a knockoff. It arrived from China, and as can be seen in the attached picture, looks nothing like the original. The shirt looks really awful, and I couldn't even tell what it was when it arrived. It looks nothing like the original shirt",1
618651,"the upper part is big yet the skirt is really tight. I don't know how that happens
i also have a small tight and I weight like 98 lbs but the sleeves is too big compared to the skirt.
I ordered a medium and thinking i might order a large but i am afraid the upper part will be so big again
the shipping is fast and the color is what is in the description.
That's all i have to say. I still think it is cute though.the fabric is good.",3
75395,"I ordered the small and it fits well, but I find it riding up throughout the day and annoying. Maybe a larger size would ride up less, but now I am at the point where I have given up on jeans so I see no point in ordering a new one.",3
65438,"Didn't come with 100, only 96 (but oh well, still a great deal!). I got a few repeats so I gave them to my friend who also has a tongue piercing. She and I both liked the fun and colorful designs, the ball and bar size, and the fact they were so darn cheap! I'd definitely buy again!",5
624227,I bought this dress for my teen age daughter.  She is very hard to fit and dress shopping is just not fun for her so finding this beautiful dress on Amazon was PERFECT.  It was just a little big in the bust but was very easy to alter.  She wore it to her dance and looked absolutely amazing.,5
668967,"The blue is beautiful! It's shiny, and delightfully sparkly! A lot of bling, and makes a bold statement. Perfect!
With the cheaper price, I'm hoping that the stones stay put and that it doesn't tarnish, because I hope to wear it for a long time.
Update. After a week, it was leaving a green mark on my finger. :(  It's not sterling silver.",5
502611,Were very cute but then when I put them on they were too tight and way too short. Being 5'11' may be expected but getting the large it shouldn't of been tight on me especially cause I can usually fit in mediums so I went up one and it was still too short. So if you get these definitely go a size up at least.,2
520223,"My wrist is a little too wide for the 108 beads, so I wear them loose, which fits perfectly for me. Not only did these arrive WAY sooner than expected, the quality of these beads is amazing and they smell wonderful. I accidentally bought the standard wrap with no charm and when messaging the seller, they were more than happy to send out the rose charm for me. Not only is this a beautiful and high-quality product, but their customer service is superb and I high recommend purchasing from them, as I will in the future.",5
689483,Bought this for my husband and he was insulted when he put it on.  The jacket is obviously a womans jacket.  The zipper is on the wrong side End it is cut big in the chest and narrow at the waist terribly uncomfortable and  he just hates it Id return it if I could but alas Im three days too late,3
409121,"Just got this ring and it's totally amazing. It has a beautifull shine and the multi-faceted pattern is just perfect. Tungsten-carbide rings are a bit more greyish than silver but the shine is like 10 times more. And the best part is that it's scratch proof. I already tested it with my keys and I didn't manage to make not even a single scratch! Finally the price is quite reasonable for a tungsten-carbide ring.
I'm definitely going for tungsten from now on. Would highly recomment this to anyone.",5
782348,"I was sad that my kid outgrew his babiators, but these sunglasses are every bit as nice or nicer. The lenses are truly polarized, not just shiny. My son was so pleased that these were for him. They don't look childish at all.
They came very well packaged. The case is adorable and very sturdy, but easy to open for little hands. All the way around I am pleased with this purchase.

I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",5
142513,"Great shirts. Fit is good. I am 5'11 and 155lbs (thin/athletic) and the medium fits well. Good length and stays tucked in. The ""v"" is slightly deeper than a typical Hanes/Fruit of the Loom, but it is narrow and well constructed, so it doesn't feel sloppy. Going to wash them a couple times before I order more to make sure they maintain their fit, but overall happy with the purchase.",5
49056,I have gotten so many compliments on the blue color and look of this shoe.  It is super comfortable.  The grip is wonderful for my indoor gym cross training classes.  I always order a half size larger in Nike brand shoes and thy fit perfectly as I did with this shoe.,5
29661,"I bought this item for myself a while ago; this time I bought it for my relative - she fell in love with it, as well as with the Necklace Holder.
These were the only two products I liked, and I did a lot of research looking for them.  I have my necklaces and earrings handy, I don't need multiple jewelry boxes.  Love this products.",5
754028,"Git how I expected,  and look actually half decent for the cheap price. Although; becuase they are cheap, the butt of the pants literally ripped the first time I sat down. Thankfully I was just putting on my shoes and wasn't in public. I am a medium built guy and in shape, these should not have ripped.",1
124528,"I ordered a size 12/18 for my daughter for valentines day. She is not a big baby, most of her size 18 mo clothing does not fit her and she is 18 months. I ordered this thinking it may be a little big or fit her good. I got the pj's and they were really nice and cute but was a little too small for my 18 month. Too bad because I thought they were cute.

442018,"These jeans are great. They have a nice amount of stretch and fit great. One thing I would say about the sizing, though: If I went by their size chart, I would have gotten a much larger size. I'm a pretty consistent size 16, though, so I got a size 16 and it fits fine (maybe even a little too big). So my advice is to go with your usual size and not their size chart. I like them so much I bought another pair in a different color.",5
837138,"I was so excited to get this bottom. However it is much smaller than expected.... I wear clothes size 4-6. I'm 5'4"" & weigh 136, I do 40"" hips & 30"" waist. So, with other reviews, I ordered a large but it's too small. I like the cut on the butt, just enough. However, the front cuts REALLY low & not enough material to pull up as high as I'd like. An XL would prob be better but not offered ",3
701264,"Extremely high waisted! In the photo is shows them coming up to the natural waist line, which would have been fine. These came all the way up to my boobs! The top of the band literally rubbed up against my bra band. Fit great otherwise and loved the snake print, but had to return. Can't tolerate having my waist band and bra band in the same spot.",3
665861,"It's a pretty product and if you had a wrist like a 2 year old, it'll fit without cutting into you. However, anyone that has a wrist larger than 5"" (which is the same category as the smallest Fitbit you can buy), it will cut into your wrist painfully. The elastic inside is only good if it doesn't separate the plates. This is not for teenagers or adults, so I'm not sure the target audience.

Again, beautiful, wearable without serious modification, no.",2
36794,"I loved the ring, it was exactly what I had hoped for. But the silver wore off on the bottom of the band, on the sides and inbetween. So because the coating wore off it is turning my finger green. I had lots of complements on it though. everyone thought it was real! Like I said, it was very pretty, maybe I just cannot wear silver.",3
274135,Bought belt in may. I like the buckle but belt has already started to crack three months later. I only use the belt a couple times a week. Probably only got maybe about 40 hrs of actual wear time out of it. I also wish the belt was wider but I knew this when I purchased it.,1

The rest of the socks are great.",3
411325,"I bought this bra as an option for my backless wedding dress.  The cups are really sticky and easy to move around.  The bra works if you have small cup or you are perky.  This bra gave me droopy cleavage, which isn't what I am looking for.  The search continues....",3

It is as described, very well made I really like it.

This is the best sun hat: the wide brim covers baby's face and ears; the crown size is adjustable; the material washes easily and dries quickly.",5
459543,"Great first walker shoe. The elastic around the ankle is. Little too tight for my liking, but these are great shoes and they look so cute. Don't get them wet, though. They're not meant for any water or mud. They get really slick on the bottom and stiff when they dry.",4
744151,I absolutely love it. I normally wear a size 12 in jeans so I ordered the 5xl (14) and it fit perfect.  The material is very good quality for the price.  Some women have complained about the cups not being enough. They fit my girls just fine with no sude spillage . I'm a 38 C BTW.  Oh and the shorts fit perfect.,5
646221,"Get a lot of compliments on this one.  The female TSA agent was caressing it like it was a fur coat and asking where I got it.  It's smallish in terms of size, so you won't have any issues with an airline saying it doesn't comply.  But it's got tons of pockets and storage and with clever packing, it's fine.  The style is it's best selling point.",5
594694,"Great product especially the price. However, the top section runs small. My breast hang out from the sides.  I am a size 20 in clothes so i ordered 3x but runs small on top. But The rest of the bathing suit is perfect. Love that the fringes hide my stomach area .",4

I'm 5'10"" and 160lbs and my dress size fluctuates between a 6 and an 8 so I ordered a medium but its a little loose in the waist. I could have gotten away with ordering the small. It looks great on, and I cant wait for Halloween now",4

I read reviews where they said it ran small, and I find that untrue.  I usually wear a 1x-2x, so I bought a 3x after reading the reviews, and the 3x is a bit big on me.  But this shirt is still very flattering, and definitely accentuates my bigger bust.",5
306591,The colors and fit are accurate but the fabric is like a cross between a plastic table cloth and those capes you wear when you get your hair cut.  It's shiny and plasticy and loud when you move.  I took a chance knowing the price may indicate quality and this risk did not pay off.  In another fabric this would be really pretty.  This is going straight to the donation pile.  I don't recommend at all.,2

Arrived in a padded envelope and the flowers needed a little fluffing, but not as squished as I was expecting. Flowers are a nice rich red color. Roses were smaller then I wanted. In product photo it looks like the camera angle exaggerates the size. I liked that the headband is covered in a black ribbon.",4

864034,Dont bother! They are not youth hats as advertised. They come from China and that is not stated anywhere. If you are in a hurry don't bother they took about 7 weeks. Really cheap imitations of a knockoff Red Sox cap. The Red Sox should be notified of this knockoff.,1

I recommend finding a different costume if you look for quality because not only was it a little snug it was so beyond itchy i had to take it off right away..... I was looking forward to using this for a convention but I went out and bought a different shirt so i can change it a bit.,2

The waist on the shirt measures 19.5"" across right out of the package without washing it. I hope this helps you pick the size you need. The mesh on the sleeves is unlined by the way. It looks just like small football jersey material.",4

It may be too small for my wife to use daily for ""mom stuff"", but my pre-teen daughter thinks it's perfect. Quality seems good enough to last til she outgrows it. It will hold the basic girl stuff and maybe a few extras.",4

It is great to carry credit card size items and folded bills (money).  It has individual slots built in to help hold your items in place.",5
216359,"The hat is fine, decently made.

Little bit of stitching is torn loose between the underside of the brim and elastic in the middle.

I guess for the price it isn't horrible but it's definitely not the best.",2

I'm sure it would stand up well should someone really wear it and not just use it as a collectable. If you know a Sherlock Holmes fan this makes an excellent gift.",5

548322,"i loved the looks of the pajamas--the lovely color--when i received them, they looked terrific, the softness and warmth was exactly what i had hoped--couldn't wait to wear them--did the first wash according to the instructions---did not expect them to shrink --the top shrunk, bottom was fine---in the company's policy it says they will not accept any laundered product back---i wrote, explained what had happened, and they accepted the product back, and sent my refund--great company--you can't expect a better service than that--",5
677439,"I love the look of this dress, and I actually wear it as a long shirt with a sweater, too cute!
Only thing I don't like about it, it's poorly made. Fabric and strings were hanging out and looked like it was falling apart when I received it. I didn't feel the need to return it because it was cheap AND was brought over from China or something like that. So, I knew returning it would most likely be challenging.",3
581321,"This product is great but thin. It's basically just thigh high stockings, not socks. Definitely more for dressing up or having a night on the town than casual wear. Mine were not as see through because I ordered the black and red. I do love them though, and I'm glad I got them despite the negative reviews on here. They came fast, in fact they still say they're on the way in my orders (needs to update lol).",4
590848,"I really wanted to like this dress but it's very poorly executed. The material is nice and I like the zipper detail but the fit is totally off. The middle section is huge and balloons out while the bottom is so tight you can barely move. I'm 5'5"". 120 lbs and purchased a medium. Really, the fit is bizarre.",1
826680,I ordered this item as i thought it would be a really fun present for my friend's baby. I ordered a 6-12 month size and what showed up was way too large. It could have fit a much older child (one who would for sure be out of a onesie). Thankfully the seller gave me a full refund.,1
121739,It works. Im a 10 in jeans so i decided to order a large .. fits too tight on my thighs but it does lift very well.  Buy 2 size bigger ; due to booty shorts being too tight it rolls under the butt which makes it look weird and fake.,3
242446,"You won't mistake this ring for fine jewelry, but for some folks this is ideal. Both my owl and I picked the wrong ring size, even though we measured each other with a tape. We bought two more rings that are the right size for us and suffered no long-term financial damage. As well, we won't stress if we lose these rings.

For what they are, all four of our rings are flawless. If your wife can accept a tungsten carbide wedding set, congratulations. You have chosen well. The rings are a good choice too!",5
724657,"Bought the small/med for my 9 year old son.  Was concerned that it might be too large, but fit perfectly!  He has a lot of hair, so that probably helps, but size seems appropriate for child his age.
Quality appears to be good and hat is quite nice looking.
My son has been getting lots of compliments!",5
681344,"It's perfect! Just what I wanted!  A wee bit longer on me which is understandable since I'm pretty short (5'3)  but I love it anyway! Very flattering. A bit see through but not a problem at all. I love how it shows the tattooi have on my back without being so bold about it. Very comfy, good quality.  Came earlier than expected and if I had known I was going to like it, I would've bought the other color too. Thanks!",5
15459,"For about 1/3 the price of similar inserts from orthopedic doctors Powerstep Pinnacle Orthotic inserts work just fine. I bought a pair for my wife who has flat feet for several years. She is very happy with them and she wanted a couple more. She also tried Powerstep Max inserts but did not like them as much. Note, like shoes, shoe inserts will be worned out over time. They need to be replaced on regular basis depend on how much you use them.",5
235638,"This has worked great, I had been looking for this for a long time, for my wallet itself was never the problem, it was always the insert. This insert has done very well so far through ""normal"" use. It's far less expensive than buying a new wallet! Caveat: that's so long as your wallet itself is in decent condition!",5
556073,"The material was very thick, not very soft  and wasn't very stretchy. I like 100% cotton and didn't know until after I got it that it is a 50/50 poly cotton blend. I gave it 3 stars for the message they are promoting but I just wish they would have put that message on a more comfy tee.",3
403976,"I like these stud earrings,,, I think they're okay. I was surprised when I received them because I thought they'd be smaller in size, like another pair I had ordered previously. Personally, I'd prefer for these studs to be a tad bit smaller. What I like about these earrings is the fact that they're genuine onyx stone and real silver. In the year since I've owned them, they have not turned the slightest shade of brass (or that tacky hue fake or plated jewelry gets after a period of time). Overall, ""Yes"" I do recommend them.",4
879885,I bought this shirt late September. It fit as expected but the collar on the shirt was rather large and flopped over as it if it has been stretched out. I requested a refund and they said I could keep the shirt and they'd credit $5. I spent almost $20 with shipping for $5 and a shirt I can't even wear?! That's crap.,1
591036,"The hat does fit well, but the adjustment strap in the back slips so if you have it on and its windy at all, look out.
I had hoped to wear this hat when i'm out walking, but living in the Chicago burbs, it tends to be too windy for this hat",3
368969,"Great overall product. Can't beat the boom for the buck. I wanted just a white pair, but couldn't pass up all three for the price of one. Flares are a bit inconsistent -- some larger, some smaller. Lengths (width if you want to call it that) are a little off, too. Nothing to truly complain about, especially at this price.",4
315982,"They look great and sizing is close to true. I thought I'd like the drawstring, but I don't. It cuts into my waist, which is the main reason I'm buying stretch jeans. Sizing true and using stretch denim at the waist would be far more comfortable. They might have to make more sizes, but it would be a better option.",3
435779,"Bought a size that fits me in all other hats, and, a size that fit me with another Decky hat, but this one fits larger and is a taller hat than I am used to so it actually slides down to where my ears attach to my head, which, I'm not a fan of. Like Decky as a brand, think that this may be mis-labeled as to size and/or they changed the height of the cap. It's the trouble with not being able to try them on before buying.",3
129269,"Awesome shoe! My baby has extra wide feet.  He is measuring at a 5E (5 quadruple wide).  He is not at all a chubby guy, just has chubby baby feet.  We tried to find him shoes but only stores like stride rite had shoes for him but why spend $60-$80 on a pair of shoes he might wear for only a couple weeks then outgrow?  These fit perfectly and are very cost effective!  We will absolutely be buying more when he outgrows these.",5
191270,Its not bad for the price. It doesn't have the best fit and you kinda have to play around with it in order to get the cinched waist figure that most corsets produce. Overall it's ok. I really don't know that I'll be ordering more of this particular brand and style.,3
174647,"I love these horns. They are made out of a cool foam that makes them super light. The clear string that they put it on is adjustable, easy to hide and easy to take out if you want. The costume I was using it for needed them to be a shade lighter, but painting over it was not a issue,",5
550208,"This was given as a gift for my daughter's friend's bat mitzvah.  It is so pretty that I am considering getting one for her as well.  Stones are well set and it's not cheap looking or feeling.  But be prepared, if you are getting it as a gift, it does not come with a chain.",5
43432,"The umbrella broke the first time it was used.  The red rubber stoppers at the base of the umbrella fall off easily.  I had to throw this umbrella away after the second use, the metal pieces (the ones that keep the umbrellas shape) broke.  Not worth the money!",1
297360,These rings were a little bit better in size I ordered three sets of rings together there were two that came that were extremely small. And these were slightly bigger I could fit maybe three of them halfway on my fingers but they really need to start making these rings and several different sizes to fit several different finger types! Service different customers not just little teeny tiny hands.,2
41753,"this reminds me of the iconic 'joy hall everything bag' of the 1980s. It is wonderful. Loads of compartments and zippers. My one and only complaint is that there is no compartment for big sunglasses. Not even the ones that come free with the bag. I still have to let my shades bang around inside my bag hitting my keys, my nook, my wallet. However, all in all, this is a marvelous purse !",4
73412,"After ready other reviews that this runs large I ordered a size down. I normally take an large/x-large but ordered a medium. A week after surgery the medium was to big and I could not use it.
Aside from how big it runs I was horribly uncomfortable while wearing this. It rode up and actually irritated my c-section incision causing it to bleed.
I would not recommend this.",2
141518,"Beautiful handbag. It's very roomy and well-made. Although there's no outside pockets, the inside is roomy enough to hold everything and contains 2 pockets and one zippered pocket. I get compliments all the time with this handbag. It's easy to wipe clean and is durable enough that it doesn't scratch or markup easily with daily use. Love it!",5
44499,"I am exchanging them because they are very snug, but I am afraid a whole size bigger will be too big, so we will see. I do LOVE LOVE LOVE the shoes! I have been wanting them for about 2 years and even though the ones that I got today were too small, I am wearing them in front of my mirror right now because I love them so much! I almost kept them even though they are far too small!",5
790795,"This bag was a med bag like describes , goes over shoulder with ease , color is Majorca blue , wish it had another spacer or zip pouch , it only has 1 small one for lipstick
Or keys ! That's all ! When I got it I had to stuff towels in it to regain shape",3
114510,"It looks great and seems like a durable bracelet which is always good. The locking mechanism uses magnets which is interesting and it works great. The only negative that I have was that the shipping took longer than it should, there was a sorting error on the way. But besides that its great!",5
264886,"The overall quality is good but the button to change the time reacts instantly. So the time is rarely accurate, and the wristband is not adjustable. On the other hand it looks as cool in reality as it does in the picture. It's worth it if you're no expecting anything more than a conversation piece. It's fun but that's about all. Don't pay too much for it.",3
626265,"We were having an Oakley sunglass event at my office and at the last minute, I asked my 13 year old to come help us out.  I ordered this shirt for him and got it in just a few days.  He was thrilled to have some Oakley gear to wear the day of the event! It is currently one of his favorite t-shirts to wear.",5
631393,I love it for what it is! It is a cheap suit that photographs well. I had a friend help me figure out how in the world to tie it. Warning: It is a cheap material and really looks like a long band of fabric. There are no instructions as to how to wrap it.,5
250199,"Exactly as described. Very well built, I see this product lasting for years. I like the spring right above the shoe horn that allows rotation that is necessary for to the long reach of the handle ... I wouldn't have realized that was a necessary feature for a long shoe horn, but the other versions that are just plastic molds won't have that. The length is great too. I'm 5'11"" and I can now reach my shoes without any bending over.",5
756407,"They are perfect dresses, they look just as the picture shows, the color is on point, and they came in perfectly condition. They do, however, run small, so make sure you go up a size or two when buying from what your normally wear. Other than that, they are perfect.",5
451215,"I usually wear a 7.5, but they didn't have my size, so I ordered a 7, it was snug with a sock on, but I went bare foot and it fit perfect.  I normally would never do that, but these boots are too cute to send back!  Danced all night in them and my feet did not sweat or get blisters.  Shipping was very fast.",5
851970,This is a pretty piece of jewelry and the chain is not bad quality but the picture is smaller than I imagined and a little blurry so when you're wearing it it just looks like the colors (which are nice) but you can't see the actual image in it unless you look really close. But it's decent metal.,3
566732,It's short. I'm 5'2 and 155. If I lay my arms straight down... it hits my finger tips. It's a nice thicker than chiffon material.  The belt is cheap but the whole top/ dress is super cute. It came pressed and free of flaws. All in all totally worth the six bucks I paid!! I bought an extra large and it fits like a women's medium.  I like it. Wish it was 2 inches longer but I like it.,4
277919,"I have a 25 inch waist, so according to the size chart, I would be on the larger size for the small waist cincher. With that information I figured the cincher would be a little tighter than I needed to be, but it is actually a larger than I expected. I wish I had purchased an XS so I could really cinch my waist. With a small, there is barely any compression, and I have it on the tightest it can be.",4
878986,"Cheap, cheap, cheap. Broke in the middle above the lenses after less than a week. I want to ask for a refund but I have a hunch they'll say it's my fault it broke. Flimsy and brittle plastic, poorly made. The screw on the right arm is also already coming loose. The lenses themselves are ok and the carrying case is par, but not worth it when the frame is busted. I don't expect a lot for glasses at this price point, but I do expect better than this.",1
732439,"I ordered it as a plus size 2x due to I am large breasted,it fits more like a large than any kind of extra large am not satisfied with the size and in top of that it does not lay well . Was not what I wanted or expected or even what it looked liked .. not happy camper o and also the neck of it looks incomplete or something not at all like the neck in this picture :(",2
280761,"Material seems pretty good.  Haven't taken it for a test drive yet so we don't know how the colors or fabric will hold up.  Came with some removable pushup pads.  The purchase link didn't allow you to pick the size.  The one that showed up in the mail was Large and it fit my wife (US size 4-6).  This venfor offered the best price we saw, sported amazon prime, and offered free returns so it was a pretty safe deal.  Overall the wife is satisfied so that means I am satisfied.",4
368867,This outfit is very cute and would make such a great gift. It seems small for a 2T. The colors are vibrant and stay bright after washing. I washed this separately the first couple of times since I wasn't sure if it would bleed. These pajamas are soft to the touch and seem to be reasonably comfortable. I think this would make a great gift for a shower or birthday. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions expressed above are those of my own.,5
714699,"I ordered the XL and when it came in I was hopefully that it would be a little big and snuggly because I wear a M. I not only could not button it, I could barely get my arms in the sleeves! The sizing chart for this is way off. The fabric was soft and it looked great coming out of the bag but the size was all wrong. I ended up donating it to Goodwill.",2
7882,"Update: After a few months of wearing it about 2 stones fell out.

I got this ring only a few days ago and it is already my favorite ring.  It is very colorful and catches the light really well to add a bit of sparkel.  It has flat sides so you can stack rings together.",3
747942,"LOVE these pants! So hard to find natural fiber clothes any more. The high waist is very flattering & the slightly flaring legs are comfy w/out getting in the way. I'm 5'-9"" & have a hard time finding pants long enough & these are perfect! Only drawback - no pockets... that would give it the 5th star :-). Unfortunately it looks like these are out of stock now. Hopefully my pair will last a looong time!",4
58120,"The fabric doesn't lay flat and it has extra fabric which creates a larger looking mid section. There's an awkward looking elastic sewn in the back the gathers even more fabric, making the wearer look bigger than they are. I'm stuck with it because I live overseas. I will have to try and fix it, or find someone to fix it, to make it presentable. Don't waste your money on this one. :( Really disappointed.",2
462462,I love this paisley RL top! BUT I love all my RL suits.. I have never ever been disappointed with the fabric or fit.. and this one is no exception.. fits exCtky like all my previous ones and isctru to size and looks great! I love that I can match it with any solid bottoms!,5
469276,"I have pretty sensitive ears but real gold has never bothered me. These, however made my ears itch like crazy and become irritated. They are very dainty and pretty, I purchased them for my second holes in hopes that I could just sleep in them. They're pretty difficult to get on. My husband had to assist, if you put them in from back to front, it may be easier.",3
28131,These are very comfortable with good arch support.  A co-worker and I started using these at the same time.  I went through 2 pairs to his 1.  The fabric around the heel peeled off mine within a few weeks and with a couple months the foam started tearing.,3
155739,This product is perfect. Half as big and half as thin as my old wallet. It fits everything that was in my old wallet too. The only problem I had was the hatch to open it was hard to open at first but after a few days it turned to an alright amount of force to open.,5
401928,As a recreational runner and long distance cyclist I have tried just about every sports drink on the market.  This is by far my favorite.  It is made with glucose and is very easily absorbed by the body.  It disolves almost instantly in water.  It is not overly sweet like many of the drinks and is very easy on the stomach.,5
243688,"These are awesome jeans! Soft, comfortable, and stylish. The drawstring waist is a nice touch and also the stretch in the material. The color was true to what was shown in the website. I am glad I bought these & recommend them highly to anyone who wants comfortable-fitting boyfriend style jeans.",5
789363,This is SUPER cute and very well made!!! The zippers are still working and I have had not issues with the stitching. It matches my Kate Spade purse exactly. Large enough to use as a clutch at night or daily in your bag for daily use. I received a discount in exchange of my honest review and testing. Thanks for this opportunity!,5
289943,"This is a great bag, it is nice looking, heavy duty canvas with a super thick re-enforced bottom.  It has sturdy straps and an additional shoulder strap that can be removed.  It has plenty of pockets and is very roomy.  It is a great blue color that will go with anything, this is perfect for anything, books or heavy items or just a tote bag to take around the city during the day.  Very attractive, very functional and will last you a long time.",5
348872,This belt seems to be well made. I got tired of my belts breaking after a week or so of use. (They'd get splits and such from being bent to latch it.) I've been using it daily for 2 months now and there's no cracks or damage. It seems to be well made.,5
141613,This is a great bag I love it! It's big but not too big. As far as the smell it does go away very quick and to speed up the process I used laundry fabric sheets and put some in my bag for a couple of days and it worked out great!,4
865374,"The blouse is absolutely beautiful. I read some of your reviews which stated that it ran small.  Very True!  But, I liked it so much when I saw it, I had to have one.  I usually wear a Medium US size, so, I ordered a 2XL  size, and it fits perfectly. So, comfortable.",5
296914,"I'm 5'4"", 140lb, Chest 35"", waist 26.5"", hips 38""... love this suit on! I would have given it 5 stars, but the padding for the chest is a little awkward. Once you get it situated it seems to look good & stay in place (but have not yet worn it swimming). Overall I think this was a great purchase.",4
223757,"Very cute ankle bracelet! I have wider ankles and it is difficult for me to find an ankle bracelet that fits. This particular bracelet is made with elastic, so it stretches. I only got to wear it once. I live in MN so we are limited to summer time. It would be really cute walking along the beach barefoot, but difficult to accompany with shoes. Overall I really liked this bracelet, even if I can only wear it a few times.",4
217344,Complete sun protection.  Fits my large head and some.  The inside is lined with black cloth and is really comfortable.  I buy all my surf needs from Oneill and am very pleased with my purchase.  Wearing the hat could be a problem if it's really windy.,4
534418,"they look as expected, like jeans. BUT you have to wear leggings underneath them because you can see everything through them. other than that, I love them and they are comfortable, kind of stretched because my thighs are a little big. (I wear a size 5/6 in jeans). very comfortable around the waist, not cutting into you.",4
437725,"Nice belt, the buckle it's not exactly the size that i was thinking but it's good for the price. The polyester part is well made and it feels very lightly. The black paint of the buckle seems delicate, the secure system of the belt is ok, like others quiksilver belts. I recommend this item but is not for daily use if you want to keep the painting in nice shape. See the pictures for details of the Quiksilver belt",4
761383,I am short-waisted and didn't have time to spare in getting this dress before a wedding rehearsal dinner. My friend's fiance is from the Philippines and loves bright colors so this was the perfect design if it would fit. I had ordered from Jessica London before and the sizing was perfect and the wrap style let me control skirt length by creating a blousy effect with the top of the dress. The wrinkles disappear once it hangs on a hanger.,5
641943,"There's a loose flap of fabric in the back that can't be held in place.  It goes under the lacing in the back.  This dress is difficult to put on.  The shoulder straps had to be shortened.  The worst part is we have no confidence that the back view won't reveal underwear or bare skin at the worst moment.  It's a cute dress, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who didn't have access to a seamstress.",1
320184,"This looked like it might be cute. I ordered it in silver. Unfortunately I missed the description where it says it is made of alloy. It does not look like silver, but a really cheap light silver color, hard to describe, just imagine what costume jewlery looks like. I have yet to wear it since I hate the look of it. I have ordered cheap jewlery before that at least appeared silver in color, this piece unfortunately does not. I gave it 2 stars because it was included in the description, my fault for not paying attention.",2
146442,Gorgeous! The crystals are an ideal size and the sparkle they give off is that of a high quality diamond making this tennis bracelet look so believably real. I have a real tennis bracelet that doesn't sparkle as nicely as this one does. It's my new everyday piece. I don't leave my house without it.,5
206134,The product is nice but the sizes run way to small and I was disappointed that I emailed the company about the size issue and they were suppose to send me stuff to send back to them haven't received nothing I just want to exchange for a larger size so their sitting in a drawer not being used pretty much a waste of money,2
23114,"This stretcher is able to get down into my new work boots easily and operates easily enough. It has quality construction with some pretty heavy duty metal hardware. The reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because the choices for positioning the plastic inserts is a bit limited and it took multiple uses with different inserts to achieve the stretch I needed. That being said, it did the job it was meant to do. I would give 4.5 stars if possible.",4
713425,"Super comfortable and a medium actually feels like a medium. Has enough stretch and isn't too snug, just right. The product came in the mail unlaced and I didn't look closely at the picture but the strings are just kind of loose ended at the top, and you can just have them loose hanging at the sides or tie them. Can't wait to wear it with so many things.",5
288609,"I've worn this several times already and i can honestly say it certainly holds your shirt in place looking nice and fitting. It's takes a bit of getting used to if you've never used one of these, but once you do, say good bye to the bunched up shirt around the sides looking like a muffin. From my military uniform to dress shirts it looks and performs great. Well worth the buy!",5
570188,"I looooooove these beanies!!! I don't normally look great in beanies, but in these I actually do!! They are the perfect fit (for an average sized head). They are dang cute and I'm always receiving compliments on them....I say ""them"" because I have multiple colors. Colors are true to the pictures. Shipping was fast, as always...but seemed exceptionally fast this time. Basically, I couldn't be happier.",5
671564,"These are super cute! They fit the 2 year old perfectly (just over 3 feet tall, 29-32 pounds). I know pajamas are supposed to be snug for fire safety, but the 2 year old really doesn't like tight pajamas and these were snug enough that I felt comfortable and loose enough that the 2 year old felt comfortable. Plus, the 2 year old loves his dinosaur legs and roaring with these pajamas!",5
232920,"This wallet is fantastic, it keeps my cards tucked securely in it ( the elastic holder is key for this ) my only complaint would be the key holder is super thin and broke after only a few days. It may be fantastic for a backup emergency key that you rarely use, but i tried using my housekey here, and the constant 'strain' on the little strap was too much. Minor issue. The wallet itself is top notch and i plan 100% to buy another.",4
120548,"First, the sizes are WAY too small. Second, I ordered a 24 month (for my 7month old by the way) and they sent me a 3T (which I didn't realize til I washed it and we were at the pool and that was all I had). The 3T wasn't even that big  however for my 18 lb baby. The design is cute but I wish I would've went with a more adjustable brand of reusable swim diaper",2
246022,"The padding was wayyyyy to big for the cups size. The padding litterally came in folded in half inside the cup. I got a small but the cup size isn't as proportional to the size. But it's okay I guess for 6$. But again, it could be a lot better.",3
69237,"I bought this item for my wife. Size is good and looks excellent on my wife.
I am disappointed b/c the packaging states the stockings are optional?  What the....if this accessory is ""optional"" that point should be evident before purchasing the product.

FALSE ADVERTISING",2

It's very sexy with no bra underneath, but also cute with a tank top or bralette. I wore it out in Vegas with a black belt & nude heels and felt great- sexy AND comfortable! (I did use some clothing tape to prevent wardrobe malfunctions)
It's a soft rayon, so be prepared to pull out the iron!",5
4235,I bought this item for my adult daughter for a party she was to attend.  I had it send directly to her apartment.  I even paid for expedited delivery.  I was delivered on time but it was stolen off her front porch before she could retrieve it!  She lives in a gated community!,1
101869,"The hat is adjustable, so that he fit is perfect. Love the safety breakaway in the chin strap. My baby doesn't mind he chin strap and the fits perfect so I don't have to fix how it sits on his head. UVB 50 is great, my baby didn't get burnt",5
398376,If anything this will get your kids up off the couch. When they bend forward and the wings start flapping its hard for them not to start giggling and take off running. Pretty fun to watch. I even had to try it and I think my other half got video but I will not be posting that. Pretty solid build. Kids have other toys to play with so its been shelved but it will be fun to bring it out every once in a while.,4
99765,"I bought this handbag for my wife who is a handbag addict.  She is enjoying it immensely.  It was bought to downsize from her usual jumbo bags, so she doesn't take ""everything but the kitchen sink"".  It is working out great!  She also loves that the bag comes with a shoulder strap to free up her hands while shopping.  It is an attactive bag and will go with most anything she is wearing.  She gives it a big thumbs up.",5
789506,"I bought the 8g pair and I really like them. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was because they like to get caught on my pillow and blanket when I'm trying to sleep.

The skirt fits great, looks best worn high-waisted. Also, your butt will totally show with this so don't expect to be able to wear it as a costume... Or do, if you're into that. Lol Would definitely buy again. Also, arrived very quickly with prime 2-day shipping.",5
489340,I love these booties. They look better in person than they do in the pictures. Priced very affordably and I always get compliments when I wear them. Great for a casual night out or you can dress them up. They look great with skinny jeans or leggings and with dresses and skirts. I only wish I bought them in black too. I am VERY HAPPY with my purchase!,5
444437,For some reason the zipper always goes sideways when I wear them...it;s so uncomfortable because I have to constantly twist my pants so the zipper can stay at the right place( in the middle ) as it should. I guess they were just put together the wrong way. I love the blue color. Just wished I don't have to constantly adjust them.,3

I plan to get some in other colors now!",5

Super glad I got this ",5

It's also tight.  Not so tight that I can't get it on, but it's definitely form fitting.  That would be fine if it were 4 inches longer.  I'll wear them once and I'm sure I won't see them again after they go through a wash/dry.",3

For a woman carrying a purse, the item would work just fine and if I didn't already have a similar item, I would use it, and still may for cards, like rewards cards.",3

The chain is very beautiful and a very good match for the pendant.  I'm very pleased with them.",5

Just wish it was the right size since I don't plan on going past a 2g.",3

I got lots of compliments on the classic look of the dress and the vibrant summer color. I did tie a medium blue ribbon around the waist of the dress as an extra accent but I think it also would have looked nice without it. I definitely recommend this dress for anyone going for the 50s look.,5

If you're looking for a bag to carry a wallet, glasses case, lipstick(s) and any other small items, this is an excellent choice!

The sizes tend to run small so buy a size up.

If they sizes were more accurate and the cloth a little sturdier I would give it 5 stars.",4

I am on the shorter side (just under 5ft 2 inches) so the cover up was longer than I had hoped for & it would fall off my shoulder some.

I would find it on the floor or in the parking lot next to my car.  I love the look.  It is very comfortable and secure.  I felt the price was reasonable.  Some have complained about the smell of the leather.  I did not have that at all.  I'm very pleased and would order from this company again.,5

A couple reviewers said they weren't big enough for an adult, but I could use one if I really wanted to. The strap is plenty long enough (I'm 5'9""). The purse itself isn't big, but it wouldn't be bad if you only needed a pocketbook, phone, and some small items.

His narrow wedding band was a 9 and he ordered a 10 in this because it was so much thicker. Wished it came in half sizes because it was a little loose on him but not enough to be a problem.

Great price, shipped fast, we both love it!",4
167572,"These pants work great. I bought them for my fiance a little over a month ago as a surprise and she loves them. She has told me that they are one of her favorite pair of workout pants that she owns. I would recommend these to anyone. Although, be cautious when choosing a size because they fit just a little bit smaller than expected!",5
54179,"This is a great sun hat...protects my little guy's face, and neck from the harsh sun and it's very breathable so he doesn't get too hot!  The fabric feels like it will dry fast, when wet, so it'll be perfect for the pool and beach!

I searched hi-and-lo for a sun hat that was affordale, and actually fits my 4 minth old...most ""infant"" hats we tried were way to big and fell into his face, but this  ""newborn"" hst works great with the adhustable drawstring...he has room to grow too!  LOVE this hat and he does too!",5
75854,"I am a size 22 pants (big gut, some hips, no butt) and the sz. 4 bella band fits great. The plastic non slip part is supposed to be downward facing, which took me awhile to figure out since there were no instructions or clear pictures. Before I figured that out, I had an embarrassing day of my unzipped pants zipper peaking out under the band. Since then, I've been super paranoid and am constantly checking my belly... since I've been wearing it right side up, no mishaps!",4
178648,"The bottoms fit as expected, but the top is WAY too small. I normally wear a medium and a 36DDD so I ordered a large for a better chance of it fitting reasonably well. I was wrong. The bottom fits fine, but the top is tiny. I would doubt anyone bigger than a cup (maybe a C) could comfortably fit.  Send silly to me to have a full coverage bottom with an itty-bitty top.",2

876356,"This dress is very light weight and comfortable. I like how it just flows on the body. The only thing I dislike about the dress is how it fit around my bust area. It looks like the dress would look better with smaller bust area as how it shows on the model in the picture.
I got this dress at a discounted price for an honest review.",4
76980,"This watch is beautifully colored and styled; however the band could have wrapped around my wrist twice and this is a traditional buckle type band.  I would have been fine with the size of the watch,  if the band was sized to fit a women's wrist as it is a women's watch,  not unisex.  Needless to say it had to be returned...",4
202900,"I'm leaving a review for the gold and gray color necklace.
I received my necklace before than the supposed date (only 9 days) that surprised me. Anyways, the necklace looks just amazing; I can't describe how beautiful and eye catcher this necklace is.
I'm in love with it; if you are hesitating about ordering I would tell you to order it it's worth every penny. Price? omg it's nothing compared to how good this necklace is. Order it now !!!!",5
825787,"I love this dress. It is a beautiful vibrant blue and the material was not at all what I expected but I was pleasantly surprised because it is perfect for summer weather. I ordered a size up and was still a bit too snug for my taste. But, it is really pretty. I got lots of compliments. I am currently losing weight so a few more pounds and it will be great!",5
325198,"These hats are cute and they fit well, but 1 of the 2 I ordered smells AWFUL. It almost smells like chemical weed killer or something. It's very bizarre and was noticeable the second I opened up the box my order came in (despite both hats being packaged in separate plastic bags). I'll definitely be washing them before wearing!",3
339825,"These tanks are adorable which is the only reason they're getting 3 stars. I'm 5""8 and  bought these for workouts, but they're too short to workout out in without constantly riding up. They're also incredibly undersized and really snug. They'll be good for lounging around the house/working from home/PJ-wear, but definitely too form fitting and too short for me to exercise in until I lose more weight. Bummer.",3
220532,I love these beanies! I have about five of them in different colors. Only thing I can think of that bothers me is that sometimes they can get itchy if you sweat in them at all! I love the way they fit on my head! There is no weird bunching at the top or limp sock look. It fits very comfortably and will definitely keep your head/ears warm! Favorite winter/fall head wear!,5
767359,"This swimsuit is very nice for the price! It's obviously a knock off of the original suit but is still money well spent. I am usually a medium but I looked at the reviews before hand and got a large, which was a very good idea! The large is actually a little bit too small still. The material is a little thin too but still fairly comfortable.",4
541925,After carefully reading the other reviews I noticed that the shirt fit small so I ordered a XXL and it fit perfectly. (I normally wear Large and sometimes XLarge) so make sure you go up two sizes and the shirt will fit great. I did not expect such a great quality it was actually a great color and the quality of the material was very good. I will definitely consider ordering more colors in the future.,5
70273,"Great hat, fit is a little larger than I expected.  This hat is missing a chin strap though.  The hat looks great, and is fine for around town, but forget wearing it in the wind, on a boat, or even if you need to run without it blowing off.  A strap would improve this from a good hat to a great hat.",4
864417,"It's a little on the flimsy side.  I'm not sure how long the tassles are going to stay on.  But, it's cute over a suit.  Fits well.  Totally see-through - you need a thick tank or a bathing suit.  But you are going to have to be careful with it.  I received this at a discount for an honest review.",3
703420,"I love this style of necklace very much, in fact I have a similar one in red.  The purple color really  stands  out and the style is attractive.  I did have one problem however, the large circular pendant part fell off the minute I took it out of the plastic. I was able to attach it back on so all turned out well in the end.  Looks Great.....",4
29337,"While very soft on the outside, the thick knobby knit on the inside is very uncomfortable for me. I have neuropathy, so am probably over sensitive, but I think modern wool socks are more comfortable since they are smooth inside and thinner. The one pair I tried, I can wear inside-out comfortably enough.",2
543145,"Really nice wig! True to the color and thick, blonde hair. Came in about a week and a half. Shipped in a nice net and package. It even has a slight widow's peak- which is perfect because I have a natural one as well. Its perfect for an elf cosplay, which is what I'm using it for. I would buy from them again!",5
578348,"I love this shirt for a couple of reasons. It is perfect for Christmas; and it can be worn without having to use a necklace to dress it up.  I have had many compliments on it. The sequins make it possible to choose a variety of bracelets and/or watches because they go with practically any other jewelry (such as earrings).  if it is still available, I will order the black top as well.  Fit is perfect for me.",5
382108,"It was way to small, definitely not a good product for busty women. It isn't too see through in the cups, but it's too big in my shoulders and torso, and too small in the cups. Would not recommend for busty women.

I did just recently get good bralettes from Victoria's Secret for $20 and they fit great!",1
688085,I purchased size 4XL.  It's actually a large in fit.  Instead of returning the coat (which looks great) I gave it to my Dad which fits him perfectly!  I will think twice before returning.  The sizing chart is not correct!  I'm normally a 2xL.  I sized up just in case but it still was received wrong!,1
93982,"At first it was kind of gambling for me cuz for this price i thought its not leather or with cheep and bad quality , but its awesome
i was looking for gloves with over 200$ price tag but this one gives me all i need
great product and i love it
on and it is with soft leather with shiny steel + Kevlar string for stitches great job
worth it totally",5
423106,Over time I have enjoyed Scully products but this shirt has disappointed.  Followed care instructions for cleaning the shirt and it now has major wrinkles that can't be removed.  Can't wear it anywhere since it is looks terrible. Because it is a 100% polyester shirt one can't iron out the wrinkles because heat will only damage the polyester fabric.,1
737440,"These are great replacement lenses. Shipping was fast and packaging was excellent. These lenses perform as described - they are polarized and reflective (my choice).

However, after a few weeks, the inside of the lenses developed what I thought was a deep scratch (these are not abused. My eye lashes may have made contact though). After further examination, it seems like the film on the inside has degraded. Otherwise, great lensss.",4
360462,I ordered a lg. It fits i wish it really came down to the knees. Im 5ft1. 150 lbs and its a little less than mid thigh and 3 qt sleeve on me. Im going to see if i can have fabric added to the dress. I love knee length,1
648199,"This hat is super cute... I bought it because a previous purchase of a ""floppy"" hat turned out to be more like a wet blanket on my head!  This one has a very fine bendy support around the rim with which you can control the shape.  Really makes a lot of sense!  And the straw bow is a lovely touch!",5
25508,"I have planters fasciitis in my left heal.  I walk miles each day, fast-paced.  If I did not have these insoles, I would not be able to accomplish this.  My Brooks running shoes are a big factor in allowing me to walk like this, but the insoles are wonderful.  No pain.  None.  I highly recommend anyone with this affliction to purchase these insoles!  Thank you so much!",5
359256,"These pants are ridiculously comfortable. I usually wear a size 14/16 and find that the waist is just right on them. I'm only 5'4"" so I also really love that the legs of the pants have the elastic. They aren't see through at all either. These are great for hot days and look great with a lot of summer camis and tank tops. I highly recommend these if you're going for that summer boho look. I'll definitely be buying more in the future!",4
223660,"I wore it for the entire day after it arrived. It's soft & comfy. It is the cheaper material but I like it because it's light. I'm 5'4 & it covered my belly button but you could still see the hanging charm from my belly button ring, I like it but I don't know about after washing it. Don't like how tight the neckline is though.",4
39908,"These do not seem as well made as the ones I had before. The top strap is not of as good of material as my old ones. The sole does not seem as firm yet cushion like. Because the top strap is more flimsy, they are harder to slip my feet into. But as far as flip flops go, they are still the best.",3
119670,"I knew I play reusable swim diaper ran small because of a previous in store purchase, so I purchased a 3T for our 2 year old (she wears 18-24M clothing, 2T is a little large for her) and this size is perfect for her. They are meant to run tight in case of accidents, so I believe 2T would also fit her fine, but she was uncomfortable with too tight.",5
656967,"These tanks are awesome for a base layer for a casual winter day. I put one on my daughter almost every day under her school clothes and she likes them. They're soft and the colors are nice, sweet, girly pastel colors. They come looking huge and feeling a little stiff, but after a wash & dry, they shrink up to the right size and soften up.",5
597017,"This shirt fit way too tight. I am a small girl -- 5' 3"" and 125 lbs -- and I ordered a Medium. It was hard getting on and taking off. I don't even think a Large would fit me. The bottom of the shirt would barely fit over my hips! I will be returning this and will not be re-ordering.",2
860830,I purchased this for my husband to wear to a flamingo themed birthday party and it was a hit! He felt it was a little snug but according to the measurements we should have ordered a larger size. I would recommend checking the measurements before purchasing to guarantee a better fit but am overall pleased with my purchase. :),5
421208,"I was looking for a specific look for a photo-shoot theme, however they did not fit or flatter as I expected. Sadly, they seem to look as awkward as they do in the photo shown... I am a size 6 in womens and I ordered a medium, and they were STILL too small! very strange! I'd order a size up if you want that classic flowing look.",4
408738,"We got this for halloween.  It's oversized, cheap fabric, and quite see through.  But, it's pretty much as pictured, worked just fine with our costume.  My husband won't be wearing it to church or anything, but it's in good enough shape to wear again for a future costume.",3
1390,"I purchased this necklace for my wife for Christmas or 2007. Not only did it arrive on time for Christmas, the packaging was very stout. Just from seeing the box and the packing material I had no doubt that the necklace had arrived in tack.

My wife loves the necklace! Plain and Simple. She says that it is great because it is interchangeable with a number of pendants that she has or it looks elegant by itself. I hit a home run with this great little stocking stuffer! You cannot go wrong with one of these necklaces!",5
840242,At first I loved it. I bought two of them. Jimin B for me and jungkook B for my bff. Now he's is perfect no problems but mine after having less than a week the writing is already half faded off. Plus it came in a bag and both sets of photo cards were crumpled and ruined.,1
157329,"I bought the black leggings with pleather insets. For the price, I wasn't expecting very good quality to begin with, but when I saw the material, it was laughable how poor the quality was. Let's try a simile: if the quality of regular $4 leggings from Forever 21 was like paper, the quality of these leggings was like off-brand tissue paper. I immediately returned them! The elastic waistband is also super dorky. I bought another brand of very similar look (LOCOMO) and the quality was just as poor! Thank goodness for free returns via Prime!",1
792883,"I listened to the other reviews about ordering up in size. These fit great, but must run incredibly small. Pre-pregnancy, I was a size ~2-4. I have not put on that much weight and my gain has really just been in the bump & bust area (thus the desire for the V-front), yet the XL that I ordered were the ones that fit & feel like they have enough room to keep wearing until delivery... I cannot, however, imagine who is wearing the smaller sizes!",4
55958,"I bought this for a tortoise and the hare costume for a half marathon. The ears were great, comfortable and stayed on without the chinstrap, even in the intense wind. So there's no doubt it would stay on for a party. I thought the tail was cute, but I pined it to my spandex and it kept coming off when I sat down.

It's a good ensemble to create a bunny costume and still leaves some creativity for the person wearing it.",4
621215,"Product arrived with only lenses, no ear socks (which was really why I had ordered this). I contacted the seller and they sent the ear socks fast. Like other people have mentioned, the ear socks are slightly short, but it's not really anything anyone will notice. My Oakley no it's 2.0s are almost 10 years old and one of the original eat socks had started tearing, so short or not, I'm thankful to have these replacements. Not sure about the lenses, ad I ordered a pair from another company I like, so won't be trying lenses until they're needed.",5
619561,"Jacket took 13 days to deliver, but it's totally worth it! My husband was SO surprised and SO Happy! Zipper was kind of tough, we put chapstick on it so that it'll slide easier. Looks like it's worth the money. Please note that seller also communicated with me as needed. Thank you!!",5
170470,"These fit perfect - went to a meeting and looked down and a three inch tear was in the seam and my lady parts almost fell out.  Had to dart into a store and buy pants right before my meeting.  Loved them, fit great - soft - but I had to throw them in the trash.",1
789643,"Absolutely LOVE these!!!!!! Do not have second thoughts about ordering as this is the most quality of work out pants that I have owned!
Size is true to fit...I wear a 14 and I ordered an XL...fit me like a glove. I've worked out in them and they've went through many washings and STILL look brand new!!!!! Plus...I love all the compliments I get on the style. Feel like a million bucks in them!",5
718642,"The leather jacket in brown is also beautiful and fits perfect in a medium.
I purchased a second one for my first cousin, Nephew to my Dad who was an Original Tuskegee Airman in Size large. Perfect fit for him as well.
I now have the leather, twill jacket and have ordered the wool jacket as well from Big Boy manufacturer .",5
762534,It gave me an infection and when I pulled out the belly button ring after only wearing it for ONE WEEK I had all this blue and green nasty stuff.. it was so gross and it hurt to take out!! Don't buy this!! If I could I would not even give it one star!!,1
262175,"I have struggled with a replacement back for my diamond earring for months, it never fit right and finally it fell down my bathroom sink.  Thankfully I found the luxlock.  They work wonderfully, so much so I took off the other original back and use just these lux locks now.  They are great and I highly recommend them.",5
597717,"Good colors,  but it was advertised as they fit small.  That being said, I ordered mediums, afraid that the small would be too small.  They hang off of me and there were stains on the backs of some of the tank tops Overall, I was really disappointed",1
229999,"Do not buy this unless you expect something that came from the dollar store! I was so disappointed when I received it & id never wear it, not even to the grocery store! I won't buy jewelry that comes from China again~You don't know what you're getting & you have zero chance to return it!!!",1
807957,"I wear 34F in Curvy Kate and Freya, and ordered the same size Annalise.  While it fit width and length wise, and my hubby liked the design, the underwires dug into my breast bone. They sat very high on my chest and left red marks because the shape wasn't a good fit for me. I returned and ended up buying a Freya Deco plunge tankini that fit me just like the bras I love.",3
259805,"I usually wear a size M shirt, but when I checked the measurement chart for this one, it said I was an XL. I figured, OK, maybe it's jr sizing or something? But no, it is WAAAYYY too big. I should have just gone with a M and ignored the size chart, apparently. The shirt material feels cheap and it also isn't as long as it appears in the photo.",2
273522,"The top in the picture looks somewhat lose but the actual product is actually quite tight (not uncomfortably) for the right size. I ordered the white top and it's see through. I don't mind that it's see through, it's white after all so what can you expect. For the price, the product is amazing. Will be buying again.",4
336075,Very nice watch box.  My son loves watches and never had a neat place to keep them. I gave him this case with another watch for Christmas. He absolutely loved it. Looks great in his room too. Plenty of room for up to 20 watches.  It says 10 slots but it came with a drawer underneath that held another 10 watches. I received this product at a  discount for an unbiased review,5
351673,"I ordered a medium as this had mixed reviews on sizing. I'm not a big person, 5'3 and around 120lbs. I typically wear a size 2 in jeans. The sizing was ok, but a little snug. They would have been ok, but I need looser leggings. I just had hip surgery, so nothing tight as they irritate my screws. Maybe I'll try the large size.",3
732000,"I was very disappointed when I received this ""sweater"" in the mail. It looks adorable in this picture but it is not a sweater by any means.
They have since changed the description to ""jacket"" but the material says it is a cotton blend, I'm not sure what the blend is but it seems more like a spandex/ polyester something or another.",1

 ""Nvie design's,"" has yet to disappoint.  With their ultra-quick service, incredible sales, and truly unique and yet contemporary products, NVIE remains one of my favorite amazon stores.  The coin-purse is quite large, and definitely could be used as an evening bag as it has a solid bottom, lovely fabric, and an intricate design.  It is also perfect as a child's bag, although i would hit it with the scotch-guard first, very lightly, drying between coats.",5
428150,"Seems like a very well made product I use mine for business cards, not sure how many fit but quite a few fit inside it. It has a magnet that keeps it shut and the magnet holds well. Id buy again if this item wore out but I don't see that happening for a while. Ill probably replace it before it breaks.",5
334671,"I expected this to be smaller due to the reviews but it's true to size. Pleasantly surprised at the quality as typically pleather tends to look way worse but I bit a bullet.
Luckily I think all I need to do is use a safety pin to fit instead of retuning and going sizes down.",4
862320,"Cute shirt, made well and soft material. I chose the Black color. Looks great with jeans. Please note that this shirt is short as the picture suggests, so if you don't want your tummy showing, this is not the shirt for you! If you do, it's cute and stylish.

Please note that I received this item in exchange for an honest review.",4
407198,"I have used this brand and style of sailing shoes for racing for about 6 years. I can't live without them and have had a hard time finding them in the US. They have soft soles that stick to the deck. The inserts inside the shoes come out so you can put custom inserts with more arch support. I never wear them on the dock, only on the boat to conserve their soles.  I put footies on the shoe inserts and don't have to wear socks. Awesome boating shoes. Thank you Sebago",5

I will say though, if you have big wrists I wouldn't order it. It's kinda small, but I have tiny wrists so it's perfect for me.",5
692551,"I didn't realize that the fabric of this tank wasn't cotton and is more of a clingy synthetic material, but it is very cute and if I can wear it without looking like an overstuffed sausage (is very stretchy, thin fabric, and runs a bit smaller than expected), will look great dressed up for work, or dressed down with jeans on the weekend :)",4
49744,"best purchase ive ever made, i started wearing it the day after i had my son and my belly definitly went down alot, it also gave me a lot of back support. if i was having more kids i would def buy it again, i always recommend to my friends",5
792921,Arrived very quickly (paid for expedited shipping). Beautiful upon first glance but expected the ribbon used to lace up the corset to be black like pictured but it was bright blue. This ribbon is also sewn so poorly that no matter how you lay it it shows ugly seams... Both things are irritating but I would normally not give a bad review but the thing I can't just over look is the fact that there isn't even the same amount of loops on each side to lace it properly.,1
389103,"The bag is great! - Fits my iPad - Has plenty of pockets and easy to wash. I bought one for my mother and once her best friend saw it she wanted one. A month later - her granddaughter loved it and we got a third lol. Now the bad is BIG - so if you are a traveler or likes to bring a lot of stuff - its a great bag.. Good Baby bag too. There is a small size one which I own, I'm on my third color with that one. Love it too.",5
217999,"Very misleading. I purchased 1 pack believing there'd be more than one in the package. Spent $8.00 for 1 button.. You'll notice if you increase the packs up the 10, the price only goes up to $10.00 meaning it's a 1.00 a button, but if you happen to choose 1 pack, it's $8.00 a button. At $1.00 a button it would be a good buy. At $8.00 a button it's a complete ripoff. Very much dissatisfied with this pricing model.",1
679551,"I somewhat liked it but two major flaws was that the neckhole was a tad too big compared to my other XXL shirts. Also, the YES logo was obviously a google search image just cropped and pasted onto the shirt. You can even see the pixels in the image. I should have gone to the official YES store and bought a shirt there, which I just did. When that new shirt comes, I might just stuff this one in the closet, never to be seen again.",3

Leggings would be necessary for me to wear this dress in public, if I had a size that fit. I won't return the dress because I have to pay return shipping, which is twice what the cost of the dress is. So, to Goodwill it goes.",2
657172,"These are very comfortable to wear and I enjoy wearing them around. Iam a 4'7"" tall adult, and therefore Iwear kids shoes so finding quality shoes is very difficult. These Iwould say are about midddle of the road. The materials feel a little bit on the cheap side and plastic-like, but Iwon't know if they hold up until test them out some more.

Pros:
nice look
very comfortable
fits as expected

cons:
feel a little cheap....concerned about durability",4
262262,"I was a little disappointed by how short this turned out to be. I'm 5'3"" and petite and it barely covered my hips. However, I do like the material and I think it was sewn nicely. It'll work as a coverup for the family trip to the water park with the in laws and the annual florida trip with my family.",3
252001,"It gathers tighter at the bottom so it makes your tummy look huge.  Also, the seam is right down the middle.  Why?  You couldn't put that on a side? Weird.  Also, Its so short you have to wear it with tights unless you plan to NEVER bend over.  I don't know if I will ever wear it.  It's not expensive enough to bother with sending back so it will probably just leave it to waste space in my closet.",3
325995,It looks just like the picture. I think it's a bit short to wear as a dress but looks great with my skinny jeans. The only negative is that it clings to the body without anything to make the mid-section look smaller so it makes me look a little boxy. A nice thing is that the top has a bit of give so I can make it lower cut or higher just by tugging.,4
427379,"I was looking for a crinoline to fill out the bottom of my A-line wedding gown a bit more, and this fit the bill. I wasn't looking to pay $70+ for one of these from the bridal stores. I was glad to find them here on Amazon for less. This has a tie at the waist so you can adjust to your size- it appeared to stay up when I tried it on at my fitting but I have not worn it for an entire day yet.",4
267956,I liked my first pair of silk pajamas so much I ordered several more. They feel luxurious and when the pjs arrive they are boxed beautifully. I went one size up to give myself a relaxed fit and am glad i did. I've checked around and this is the best price for silk pajamas. The other ones will have a blend of polyester or will be satin...which doesn't breathe like silk or any natural fiber will.,5
281683,"My two-year-old is swimming in the 2T size, but we just rolled up the sleeves and it's fine. Lots of room to grow. The robe is super soft, and he loves to wear it while he brushes his teeth after he gets out of the bath. Hilariously, he LOVES the slippers and insists on wearing them to walk from the bathroom to his bedroom, but they're loose and flimsy and way way WAY too big, so he shuffles slower than a 90-year-old and it takes forever. The robe is awesome, though.",5
664181,"I really love this dress.  You cannot beat the price.  The fabric is form fitting, but not transparent.  It does cling to every inch of you so proper undergarments are suggested.  It's the most comfortable thing I have put on recently and will be great for layering.",5
249812,It was a really great necklace. I had ordered one before from a different seller but it tarnished after a while. This seems like much better quality for sure. I did have trouble with the clasp as it seemed to be fused shut but that's not really an issue for me because I make jewelry so I know how those things go. It's very shiny and it definitely allows for room to adjust depending on the neck. I love it and I am happy :),5
811001,"The ball on this is bigger than I would like it to be. I was expecting something a lot smaller.  It's simply not flattering to me. May work on someone with a bigger nose, I feel mine is average size. The quality seems good, it's just the size that I hated. The seller was very cooperative and communication was fast and clear. Seller was understanding and allowed me to return for a full refund.",2
840754,These are very beautiful.  I have sensitive skin and it is hard to find jewelry that I can wear for more than a couple of hours.  I was able to wear these longer with out discomfort.  I really like that they came with two kinds of backs for the posts.  Thank you for letting me purchase them at a reduced price.,5
234318,"These are my son's first pair of light up shoes and hes a big fan. They seem comfortable, he played all day in them without any complaints. They do seem to run a bit small however. Overall they are pretty cute and seem to be well made. They so seem a tad on the pricey side but I guess everything paw patrol has it's price!",4
322916,"A great way to keep a tie in place without damaging it. Much better product than the other one offered on Amazon. These are thicker and more substantial but cumbersome. These don't rip, tear or bend so they last longer. I bought two additional packages because I can't seem to remember to put them into my jewelry tray each evening.",5
36147,"I purchased the adult size Totes Bubble Umbrella and it was way too heavy for me, so I saw this one for kids. It doesn't protect as well, but I decided to keep it, because I am hoping that when I walk in the rains & it's WINDY, it will not collapse upward, as many of them do.",3
271801,"These are super cute, I bought 3 sets so all my lobe piercings match. I love how they screw on so I don't have to worry about the backings falling off. They tend to get stuck on clothing, but that is a minor issue. I wish they came in more color options, especially green.",4
209696,"This is my second purchase of the ""Lace Effects"" edition. I LOVED the first ones I got. They were very pretty and subtle. The ones I got this time are cute, but definitely not the same and not subtle. Also, they have a print, but it looks nothing like lace. The description did say assorted colors, which I expected, but it did not say colors would vary.",2
501097,"I saw this dress on Pinterest and had to buy it! I was weary about ordering anything from Sheinside based on other customer reviews, but I'm glad I did! It fits fine, quality isn't that great - but you pay for what you get! It is completely see-through so I will be wearing a bodycon black slip underneath. It's really cute!",4
776985,"I purchased this in hopes that my baby could wear it for the 4th of July. But I will be returning it. I washed it by itself on cold with a gentle cycle and the red stripes bled onto the white stripes. They are blotchy pink stripes now. I also noticed  that the sequin heart design is significantly off center, to the left. White stitching is visible on the straps and across the neckline and it is not of quality you would expect for clothing.",1
352765,"I have been a 29 for a few years, every pair of pants I have is 29. I got a new pair of jeans in 29 like a week ago and they fit perfect. These aren't super tight, but a bit uncomfortable on the waist band. BUY A SIZE BIGGER THAN WHAT YOU ARE. They look really nice though.",3
111705,"Looks like it can be a nice bracelet most suitable for a young girl.  Cute little charms set on a bracelet composed of 2 adjustable wires.  However, had to return it.  One of the wires was completely tarnished.  Wonder how long it was sitting on the stock room shelves.  Too bad.",1
833407,"love this top but ORDER YOUR SIZE!! the people complaining about sizing are probably one of those vanity sizers and buy sizes that barely fit them anyway. I got a size bigger and its a bit large but i'm hoping it will shrink down in the washer. I normally buy a size large, but went with an extra large. will buy a couple more colors because i like this shirt so much! nice cotton material.",5
335087,"Having a triple E width foot, I can't always find cute shoes that I am able to wear. These fit well and I have worn them all day at work with minimal problems. I am very happy with the durability of these booties. They are unique in the cutout design, which shows socks (make sure to wear pretty ones). You won't regret these! Durable and well made, run wide.",5
131081,"I purchased this dress because of the flared, pleated skirt. The top part is lace and stretchy, which was an asset. The waist in seam is a little too high (just barely under the breast). I wore a wide belt to fix that flaw. The skirt is kind of short so one has to be very strategic with movement. I paired the dress with a pair of matching Mary Jane pumps. The outfit will be great for a daytime, sunny outing or brunch. I am satisfied with this purchase overall. Thanks.",3
482478,"This hat fits perfect for my head which is a 7 3/8 fit. I like it because you can form it any way you like. I've gotten a lot of comments from people because of it's rugget style. The box that it was shipped in was very small. Once I opened the box, I was impressed with how it can reshape to a nice hat.",5
360748,"This is so naughty and I'm excited to surprise my boyfriend with this! Everything about it was great for me! I'm 140, 5'5 it fit perfect, not too tight not to loose either. I wear a 36C and it was just perfect in that area. The material was also much nicer than I had expected, very soft and also very comfortable which is a big deal as a teddy is not always the most comfortable to wear. I highly recommend! - Works on all body types. Thank you Queen. M will be purchasing more from your line.",5
418434,"This garter belt is incredibly high-quality and fantastic for all of my costumes! I was incredibly hesitant about putting forth so much money, but I'm so glad I did. This beats my plastic clasped garters by a tenfold in utility and looks. It also holds up wonderfully as I have worn it probably about 20 times over the last couple of years and they are still in pristine condition-- no holes or snags anywhere, even in the mesh! This is such a classy, beautiful garter belt set. I would really recommend you to purchase.",5

I am pregnant and none of the sizes fit to perfection with me , I got into communication with them , send them my size , and I sent him NOT just perfectly, but it came to me immediately.

Love this dress , and I am very grateful to the seller!",5
612607,Used this as a Halloween costume my 11 year old wanted to be the rainforest so I spray painted the fabric green and layered flowers and greenery on with safety pins. I also created a waterfall down her back all held on with safety pins even with all the added holes I created to hold the suspenders system and lights on the waist band this held up. I put this thing through the wringer and it made it through Halloween with no issues,5
49841,"The picture shows a model wearing a long sleeve top with a barely scooped neck.

What I got was a 3/4 sleeve top, with a neck that was so broadly and deeply scooped, it was very nearly off the shoulders. Already have one of those, and it looks better than this. Thanks for nothing!",1
802740,"These are super cute and have bought them countless times as a gift.  They are tiny but I quite like them because they can be worn for every day.  The only downfall to these is that they are pretty sensitive, so much that they'll usually bend.  Overall, I'm pretty happy with them and the price, hence why I order them repeatedly.",4
338734,"The center strap won't lay in anything but an awkward looking way under one of the side straps. It also does have an odor that's not great. But, since one of the straps came out of the clasp, I can't wear it. Not returning, for the money it's not worth it.",1
606407,The beads are well strung and I like the strong elastic so I can wrap them around my wrist or wear them around my neck. The sandalwood smell is nice and one of the reasons I bought them. The removable charm is good quality and has a lobster clasp. Very nice.,5
152222,I used this for the Tinkerbell Half Marathon. I was Ariel. It stayed in place nicely. I never had to adjust it. It was very comfortable. The band that sits against your forehead is very soft and wicks away moisture. Nice wide bill to keep the sun out of my eyes. Only problem was that sequins fell off everywhere. Oh well. Not a deal breaker.,4
285242,"This necklace is extremely cheap, and I imagine that if it got wet it would turn your neck green.

However, LOOK AT THAT PRICE! It's unbeatable. Of course the jewellery will be ""cheap"" at that price. Personally, I was expecting a pretty piece of dainty, cheap costume jewellery and that's exactly what I got. From a distance, while you're wearing it, it still looks beautiful and you can't tell.

When I ordered this, the estimated shipping was almost a month. Still, it arrived in less than one week.
I would buy this product again.",5
341381,"I am 5'3"", 145 lbs.  These leggings fit just fine, I had to fold them at the bottom because they were a little long for my height. Very nice material, not too tight in the legs. I read mixed reviews on the ""see throughness"" of them. I definitely could see through them on my butt. They would be just fine with a tunic or long shirt, I could not see through on my legs at all. However, if you have thicker legs, I think they would probably be see through.",4
225146,"The underwear is OK but not used to the big band around the top...a little tight and afraid after washing will get more so.
Also the label in the back is bothersome...will have the tedious job of taking it out...sticks out too much.
Wanted a brief-brief and this sort of fits the bill but am used to Jockey bran similar but no big band and no big label.
Joseph Abboud DOES have one almost like the Jockey brand but did not show up on his or Amazons site.",3
695777,"Has a nice feel, good weight, more solid than a lot of the d-ring belts I've tried. Thick and textured so it does not slip out of the loops as easily when I'm wearing a phone holster. The texture also keeps the belt from loosening in use. I will buy these again.",5
213701,"I like the look of these tights, but unfortunately the legs are ridiculously short. I am of average height and weight, and I fall into the mid-range of the sizing for M/L. These tights, however, hang about 4 inches down in the crotch area, making them very hard to wear comfortably. I find myself having to pull them up constantly and trying to stretch the legs. I don't recommend them. I'm sorry I spent the money on them.",2
180434,"It's a nice hat.  Unfortunately, it's not sitting properly on my head.  I think it may be the fault of the brim.  I would have to keep pulling it down.  It does have adjustable strings inside, which is nice, but doesn't help with the brim issue.  It will have to be returned.",3
120950,Great for travel! My little boy loves to watch the colors change as he is drifting off to sleep. In the mornings I hand it to him to occupy him while I do his first diaper change. I love that is has a secret off on switch. So glad the previous reviews had great info and glad I took the chance and ordered it.,5
516621,"My 18 month old has an average sized head, 46% for her age, and they were not only too small but she took them off and then tried to put them on herself and the arm broke off as soon asnshe did it. She didn't use excessive force or try to brake them either. Not impressed. Her target ones lasted five months.",1
651839,"I bought these for a mad gatsby themed party, these are fantastic!!!! I was nervous I would rip them when I put them on because they are fishnets but they went on great and are exactly what I was looking for. You can't beat the price. I'm 5ft and a size 6/8.",5
460954,"This necklace is absolutely beautiful.  I bought 2 and gave one to my daugher and she loved it.  For the price it is well worth it.  I sparkles and hase brilliance that is noticable from a distance.

My only complaint is between the v charm and the chain it will snag your clothes.  However, all in all I would not return it or exchange it for anything.",5
483487,"I bought this belt a little over a year and a half ago.  After 18 months of daily use, the buckle finally gave out, and I am buying a second one.  I think it's the longest I've ever had a belt.  I'm a ""between"" size on most belts, and have to make a decision between breathing easily or keeping my pants up -- these belts let me tighten to the perfect spot, and work great.  They're stylish and attractive, and definitely durable.  Very pleased.",5
769075,"They are too stiff. My dog (bichon frise) was walking awkwardly wearing them, just like Cuba Gooding Jr. was with the submarine suit on from the movie Men of Honor [...]. I'm not a vet, but using common sense, I don't think they are good for the joints. Would not recommend.",1
180610,"I ordered this without looking at the review and after I read the reviews I was expecting that its too small because I ordered small but when I recieved it its still little bit big to me, maybe Xs is fit to me, So I repair bought side to make it fit to my body and also the sleeve because little bit long and big to my arms. After I saw it its now perfect its fit.",3
780485,"I can't even remember how much I've paid for but it was not worth it at all.
I ordered in black and white. I normally wear small. but since it was in Asian size, i ordered XL. white shirt looked like XXL but the black onewas about medium or even small. weard smell and very cheaply made.
I was VERY disappointed especially after waited for a month to get here.
I can't even return it because it's going to take anothet month to get there and I have to ship it as International. don't waste your time and money.",1
554847,"Nice quality setting, but set much too high for my tastes (tends to catch on clothing and scratch things you reach for).  Did not rub the ides of your fingers, so it was comfortable.
The center stone has a nice sparkle, but the side stones are surprisingly dead.  It was as if they were made of different material.",4
109042,"I like my wallets thin. This is pretty thin with just the right amount of pockets (four outer pockets, two inner pockets, and the elastic bands on each side). It's perfect for anyone who likes to keep it light.

The stereo design is pretty fun and looks exactly like the picture. Pretty good over all.",5
747402,Very thin material.  It is not stretchy without pulling out some stitches on each side of the sweater.  I did not pull it too much and it kinda just fell apart at the seems.  It's also almost totally see through so just be mindful that something MUST be worn under it unless you want all to see your goodies.,2
304849,"They ft fine, but I find it very hard to do yoga in them. When I stretch, the fabric doesn't, so if there is any twisting at all on the legs, the pants get tight on my legs and I have to interrupt my practice to pull them straight again.",3
740296,"Bought these for one of my grands who has definite tastes and not always easy to please.  They were perfect, light enough for Spring and Fall but can wear layers under in cold weather.  She loves them and plans to get more.

Also washing and drying is a breeze and colors stay true.

Would purchase for my other grand but she is allergic to acrylic.

Good product, good price and I will buy again.",5
88400,This costume was very fun to wear. I wore it to the Halloween Party at DisneyWorld. I didn't like the ears that came with the costume and purchased Minnie ears at Disney. The one thing I didn't like was that the costume kept bunching up on the sides (around the black middle) and I had to fidget with it all night - perhaps I just bought a size too large? Not sure. Overall I liked the costume.,5
412782,"Why did I wait so long to get another pair? For me, it took only a few days for my feet to get used to them. I can wear them around the house all day without any pain. It's as if it 'hurts less' when my feet really needs the accupressure!",5
184803,I purchased this bag for my international trip and when i opened the package there was an odor. Not even two weeks later the lining started to separate from the bag and the zipper is broke.  This was a poorly put together project.  I will never purchase from this company again.,1
453663,These pjs are so cute on my son! They did fit as expected. He wears a 4t in most pajamas since they are made to be snug fitting. In daytime clothes he wears a 3t. He has only worn then once so we will see how well they hold up!,4
42549,"Yeah I ordered these last year, had to open up another one from the pack, the part that goes over your ear was broken. I thought OK that's alright...opened another one, same thing. Two broken the same way from the same pack??? Not sure if I can be compensated now for it...am afraid to open any more at this point....",1
695651,"If you have a long torso, this is the swimsuit for you!  I guess if you have a short torso, it would work too. The ruching is not sewn, but is caused by elastic and the bunching up of a very long suit. I bought a Medium, based on other reviews, for my 11-year-old who is very square-shaped. It's cute and she loves the color. It does have padded cups, which I may cut out because she is only 11 and not in need of them. It fits her because it can bunch up in the middle.",4
621771,"Pros:  1) This shirt has a great design and logo. 2) shipping was fast.
Cons: 1) I wear a standard US XL.  I ordered 3XL and it barley fit and I'm afraid if I wash it it will shrink and be too small.  2) The DD logo is ironed on, it is not a silk screen. 3) The logo should be a couple inches higher on the shirt.  4) The logo is a slightly different color red than the rest of the shirt.  Buyer beware.  I would not order again from this seller.",2
455540,"These definitely run small! My 7 month old is 50th percentile for pretty much everything and she is in a size 12 month for this diaper. With that being said, once we had the correct size this was amazing! It's convenient, easy to wash, easy to clean. Highly recommended for summer fun. Keeps in the poo of a breastfed baby really well too!",5
287830,"The sleeves are not quite as long as they appear and the back has a lining that helps position it on your shoulders. I'm not crazy about this lining as I would prefer a looser fit. However, it really is beautiful, fits true to size, and I have already received many compliments. A great buy for the money and I would truly recommend. The material looks and feels like high quality and the picture is a great representation of what it really looks like.",4
556279,"This small case was what I was looking for to hold various loyalty cards. The lower rating is because it is NOT leather as stated in the description; it is vinyl. For the price, I would have been surprised if it was leather. Also, the color is more bright pink than red which doesn't matter to me but it might matter to others.

A feature that I like is has two snap locations.",3
161484,"Super cute! Since there doesn't seem to be a sizing guide I wasn't sure what size I should order. I went large based on the reviews but I needed a smaller size. I don't think I would buy it again without knowing the correct measurements, but I would like this a lot if it fit nicely.",4
157037,I got this as a gift for my son that is learning to tell the time. I thought it would be a good way to learn since it has the seconds minutes and hour hand. Now i went behind my son's back and got him the one i liked and not what he liked and to my disappointment the numbers to help him read the minutes on the outher part of the watch is missing. Not what i was expecting would have chosen a different design had i know,3
343549,"IT FIT! I'm 22 weeks ago about 200 lbs, 5'5"" and very busty. I odered the XXL and it fit nicely. The bottoms are a bikini cut and tie on the sides, i found a pair of womens board shorts to wear over them to make me feel more comfortable.",4
431235,"I absolutely love this sweater.  It looks very elegant, and is light and comfortable, but also warm.  I have received many compliments on it.  The only thing I would suggest changing, is the buttons were a little too large for the hooks.  Very difficult to fasten.  I replaced the buttons with smaller ones.  I am very happy with my purchase.",5
67580,"For the price this is a very pretty ring.  I gave it a 4 star only because the stone is very light color in the one I received, in most lights it looks almost clear.  It does sparkle and looks well made for the price but does not look expensive as some of the reviews have said, at least compared to other rings I have.  It is very lightweight.  If you want a fun sparkle for a night out then I would recommend buying this ring.  It does look like the picture.",4
141312,My daughter purchased this bag to use as a camera bag - it arrived quickly but when she opened the package the over the shoulder strap was missing and one of the loops that the shoulder strap connects to was stuffed in the back zipper pocket.  She will be returning this item.,2
405807,"I bought this for my mother-in-law, who had been searching for one like it for months.  It is very roomy and has lots of compartments for keeping things organized.  However, the strap came apart from the purse a few months later.  Maybe the kitchen sink was more than it could handle.  This would probably be great for someone who doesn't have to have the whole house in their purse.",4
640776,"Bought via Amazon Prime, not via measurements. It is not the company's fault I am on a very short timeline and have a large chest... the materials are good and I didn't realize that it does have some light boning. The reason I docked a star is because the buttons and beads seemed a little loose.",4
383619,"I absolutely love this brand's leggings & have many pairs (6 or 7) of the full-length, plus-size. However, these do not fit in the waist like all the others; they actually hurt! I'm 5'10, sz 16, & these cut into my waist to the point I couldn't wear them more than an hour?! I thought maybe I was sent a regular size, not plus, but I wasn't; the tag says plus. Frustrating, because these are so comfortable & the material is unbelievably soft! Super disappointing.",1
354217,"I ordered two of these based on other reviews saying it was too small but I found that it fit just fine.  I am petite and thinner, so maybe that's why it fit ok.  Super cute though and everyone was jealous of it at the color run I wore it to.",5
138578,"These are awesome pregnancy work out pants.  Worn from the time my lulus got uncomfortable, 7 months now and still fit great.  I am 5""8 and almost 200 lbs at this point in pregnancy.  They stay up love the v back, I prefer these crops to the longer version for working out.  Only complaint is that they pill a little bit in the thighs.",5
215064,My boyfriend wears an XL in all of his shirts but this sadly was way to big so he wasn't able to wear to a Luau party we went too. I would suggest buying a size smaller then your actual size. The quality and style of the shirt was really nice!,4
476838,"The Caribbean Joe Women's 3/4 sleeve V Neck Side Rouch in the Dry Papya is just beautiful, fits perfectly, true to size, the colors are so vibrant and the fabric is quality and very well made, not flimsy at all.  I will definitely purchase in other colors and would highly recommend to everyone.",4
706024,"I liked the style of the vest. It looked like what was shown in the picture. The followedreviews people posted about the vest fitting too small. Many recommended ordering a size larger than your true size however, I am a small and ordered a medium and I was swimming in it.  Had to return it.  I requested an exchange but the co.pany issied e a refund. Too much effort when I to this order. Not worth it and I have no vest.",2
542692,I was looking for a hat for my daughter's wedding shower with a Jane Austen theme.  I couldn't find anything closer.  I was very pleased with it when it arrived.  I looked better than anyone there.  Now what in the world will I do with it? !!!  Ha,5
786000,"Excellent purse, authentic.  Perfect for spring.  The color is very beautiful.  The purse is roomy, has a large zipper compartment in the middle and the leather is very soft.

My purse is finally organized and easy to reach anything I need,  I am very happy with this purchase.  Thank you!",5
412230,"I bought this shirt for specific wear under my scrubs. It's perfect for this as the shirt fits very tight, but still soft and comfy. Color is very bold. Sleeves go all the way past your wrists slightly. I can't imagine wearing it any way but under something, as it's just too form fitting (you'd see every line of a bra).",5
54948,"I bought this as a gift for my son who is into Alvin and the chipmunks.  The shirt was a cheap tshirt with what looks like an ironed on yellow ""A"".  It does not look like the picture that they show you.  I wasn't expecting much, I mean it's a tshirt but was upset when I saw it and how it didn't resemble what is pictured as the purchase.",1
778905,"5'4"", 140 pounds. I got into these but they were a little tight. Also, they are a little see through, though you'd be okay with a long shirt. Finally, the product doesn't match the picture. The ratio of stars to stripes is bigger, ie: one leg isn't all stars like the image suggests. (I also bought two other versions of the same legging. These are all the same product with a different name. I returned them all.)",2
582275,THIS WILL BE MY HAPPY NEW YEAR'S OUTFIT!!! The only thing I didn't like about this outfit was when I got the jumper out of the bag I saw no gold cuffs like its shown on the picture. However with the way it fits me I can over look this small error. I'm 135 & 5'5 I order a small.,5
460925,"I love this dress. I would give it 5 stars if it fit me.... And that is my own fault, not the dress'
However, It is too small for me, and not stretchy enough to fit me.(if I want to breathe) bc I'm curvy, with a large bust.
I will keep it anyway bc it's such a good $ deal
I will either give it as a gift, or wait until spring when I always drop weight.
(my weight seems to fluctuate with the seasons)
Anyway, awesome for the price, and cat prints on anything RULE",4

The dress has a decent length to it. I'm about 5'8"", 140 lbs, my waist measurement is 28. My order came with 2 black belts I don't know if that is normal though. One belt was a bit thicker than the other. Sorry for the pictures I only had my nine year old brother available.",5
829072,"Bought for younger brother, it fit him perfectly and that kid would not take that sweater off even if his lofe depended on it.

Don't expect to carry your whole life story in this wallet but it's good for a teen who is say going to the mall for a day. Few pockets and 2 hidden spots is about all. But nice wallet. Good weaves nylon feel and the emblem is sure to please any fan. I've gotten compliments left and right.,4

I wet the foot thoroughly with 75% alcohol, 25% water before using it and they came just great,  Since you stretch each shoe separately, I wrote down how many times I turned the handle so they would come out the same width.",5
616741,"I haven't had a chance to use it yet, but compared to my old rain gear, the fit is much better!  I probably could have gone smaller and it would still be fine, but, for golf, a little loose is better than too loose or too tight.

All in all very pleased with the purchase.",5
219763,"This shirt is cheap quality. The makers need to stop modeling shirts that were not cheaply manufactured and probably made especially for the picture that does not at all represent their product (which I've bought a few from). Their design concept is decent but the quality is about as bad as it gets. This particular shirt had a fake seam (at sternum/ mid-chest) that ran totally crooked and the buttons were sewed on this crooked, fake inseam. It's so bad it was funny. But, you buy a 10$ shirt from HK or wherever it's from and that's what you get.",2
786217,"It's so beautiful!! The fabric is a little heavy for summer but would make a great fall skirt. I bough XL because that's all they had in this pattern. I just had a baby and I'm 5,6 and weigh 175 and it's a little big on my waist. I would order a large next time",5
696655,"This is a very nice bag.  It is a good size for my needs.  It allows me to distribute my somewhat heavy items in a manner, which makes them less of a burden to carry.  The color pleases me.  It fits with many of my outfits.  I do wish that the handles on it would allow me to shorten them a few inches more.  At my 5' 2"" this would allow me to carry the bag more comfortably near my waistline.",5
268395,"Love the soft leather. This purse can be used as a wristlet clutch or crossbody. Very nice hardware. There's an outer zip pocket, fits my iPhone 6, and an inner zip pocket plus two slip pockets. I was even able to squeeze my sunglasses in. The only thing that would make it better would be if the crossbody strap were all leather instead of cotton webbing on the back.",5
224894,"It took a exactly a month from the day I ordered the scarf for it to get to my front door. That's a little longer than I was hoping for, but it was WELL worth the wait!!!! This scarf is so soft and well made. The colors are bright and as pictured.. Honestly I can't tell the difference between this one and my old Zara scarf that I lost!! GREAT buy!!",5
734102,"The pattern and fabric were okay, however it was just one sheer piece of a silk - type of material sewn into the shape of a tie.  The skinny end wasn't sewn into a point, instead just a straight end. I was told it wouldn't arrive till the end of December,  but I did get it before Christmas  (meant as a gift for my boyfriend). After finding out each tie is especially made and that they are shipped out of Germany, I am all-in-all disappointed with the quality.",3
50793,"I'm 10 days postpartum with our second child, and I can button my pre-pregnancy jeans. Sweet!

Sizing Note: I was right on the border between two sizes, so I sized down. I had to wait a few days to wear it, but it will be more useful to me in the long term.",5
370195,I really liked that this was able to have a bottom portion to it. It fit really well and I was able to wear it if under my form fitting dresses. The clasps in the front are really good in helping the overall shape. The one thing that I do caution is that do not try and make the front clasps close more than they should (for example if it only fits to the first clasp do not try and make it pull to the second clasp) it will leave some ridges and that looks unflattering.,4
267409,The costume was made perfectly to fit my wife.  She ordered a large and she wears a size 12.  She wore black leggings and knee high boots since it was long enough to cover her bottoms but too short when bending over.  The fabric and design is of great quality and I loved her in the costume plus she received many positive feedback from others.,5
568838,This is a rather large bag which contains a smaller one of the same color and material.  I chose the smaller one to meet my needs.  My daughter was thrilled when I gave her the shoulder bag.  I have received several compliments on the color of orange.,5
282040,"I get that sizes are determined differently depending on country and manufacturer but when I order an XXL - I mean XXL.  In American terms, this is more like a 10 or a 12.  (And yes, I did check out the sizing chart).  Also, the quality or feel of the material is very poor.  Pretty design and color but I wouldn't wear it even if it fit per specification.",1
809171,I love love love these gowns and I have one in every color. The white and black is my favorite but the red and blue are pretty too. They're perfect for work or even a night out and they're so comfy. I would buy even more of them if they were offered in other colors. It can be hard to find dresses that flatter my body because I am plus-sized and these dresses do just that.,5
764234,"Love it!  A perfect fit and comfy on hot days! Be careful when washing,  and use bleach. Otherwise the black die bleeds BAD!  I ruined the last dress just hand washing in cold,  because there's so much dye. It's now gray n black,  so this time I went ahead n used bleach n the washer,  and there's no problem!",5
780538,"This shirt is the ugliest piece of clothing I have ever seen, made from the lowest quality materials I have ever seen. It looks nothing like the picture. The return policy is such that it costs more to send it back than it was purchased for. This product and company are exactly why people are, and should, be hesitant to buy clothing online. The quality is so poor that you can't even use it as a rag, it might work as sandpaper.",1
133936,"I've been really obsessed with printed leggings lately and these were a great purchase. I got them in the mail eleven calendar days after I ordered them so I was really surprised by the fast shipping time. The material is really smooth and nice. They're a little baggy around my ankles but I'm only 5'3 so they may work for you if you're a little taller than me. Overall, I would recommend them and I think I'll be ordering form this seller again.",4
62052,"Nice fit, comfortable though the silicone pad doesn't exactly sit on my scar unless I pull the c-panty down a bit.

I'm 5ft and at end of day the c-panty rolled at top like pantyhose do...such is life for the petite! That said it was nice to be able to wear underwear that didn't hurt when touching the scar.",4
556386,"I really like this shirt! It's super cute and looks adorable on my son... it's just too small. I bought it in the 18mos size, he can still wear some 12mos stuff, but this one will be put in the hand me down pile probably by the end of this month. So I paid $20 for a shirt he only got to wear it for 2 months.",3
866660,Great Cooperstown Twins shirt. Works as a women's top. The shipping was fast when I paid for expedited shipping and the customer service was really great too when I reached out to ask if they could get it to me by the date needed as the shipping had a date range. Shirt is nice and soft as well. Does shrink a little but I knew that going in and purposely put it in the dryer to shrink it up a little. If you don't dry it you won't have that problem.,5
56688,"I really wish I had gotten these in my first pregnancy. I am living in them now going into the third trimester. They offer nice support and help smooth areas that have extra pregnancy weight.  They are also helping with pain from varicose veins when I am on my feet a lot, but without having to deal with full length support hose every day.",5
33097,"Ive had this jacket for less than a year.  IT IS NOT LEATHER AS ADVERTISED.  The jacket is peeling and rubbing off on the sleeves and back of jacket.  If I could return it, I would.  A nice jacket, I get lots of compliments, I am disappointed that it is not leather, I expected better wear.",2
310251,"The shirt itself would probably fit if the sleeves were made of a ""giving"" material. Not sure of the material but it reminds me of what a windbreaker jacket is made of, i couldn't bend my arms at all. I even needed help getting it off after trying it on!",1
693483,"I got it as a halloween costume... but was secretly hoping that it would look like the model. It was close, however, there wasn't enough fabric on the top to have that effect... in fact, it was tight in the crotch and I was uncomfortable. I am 5'5 and about 150lbs, and I got a medium.",3
95559,"I went online specifically to bulk order the overpriced pantyhose that rips too easily. I ordered Q size cuz Im quite spacious for a short girl.....and lord almighty, these are tighter than Bs that Ive bought in stores. To their credit: they definitely don't tear or weaken easily. But they *will* cut off blood supply to every part of your lower torso. Hate this purchase and will not order again. Fat ladies need tights too.",2
88178,"I love avaitors. I also am a self-proclaimed klutz. If I don't break my glasses, I lose them. Three glasses in a pack helps keep me from being shadeless (one pair for the car, one in my purse, and one in case something happens to one of the first two pair), and they look great! I've been wearing them for a month and haven't scratched them. I will buy these again for sure.",5
782321,"I just got the dress and it was packaged beautifully, the dress was folded and slightly wrinkled as to be expected. The fabric felt wonderful and the dress looked exactly as pictured. It looked beyond beautiful on and fit perfectly with a little bit of room. My boyfriend said it looked so beautiful he even teared up. Needless to say I will defiantly buy more.",5
89428,"I am 5'7 160 lbs and a curvy build. I am not large by any means and expected the medium to fit just right, but they are huge! I understand that scrub like bottoms are suppose to be a little big, but these swallow me. They are long and definitely flare legged.. a little too flare for this girl. Based on the product review from other customers I though I would love these pants but I am very unsatisfied. I will be returning these.",2
319820,"The medium was small and Im 4""10 but have curvy hips. The lace on the dress did not match the lace on the cover up. It comes with two pairs of string for underwear but I not taking it back because of timing. I recommend that people buy large... The medium is a small.",2
549305,"Wore my new ""tennies"" to work and got lots of compliments. Big Bronco following here!! The shoes are well made, roomy. They are very flat, so if you need support or are on your feet all day, these may not be for you, or you will need insoles. I am really happy with the shoes.",5
276479,"Good looking glasses. I have a small face and they fit me well (I'm a guy, if that helps you with how big these will be), so definitely look somewhere else if you've got a big head. Sturdy and haven't come apart yet. They are a little cheap feeling, but they are cheap. Polarizing on the lenses is really good. The shape is a bit more round than you might realize.",4
397387,"I bought this pair of earrings because I felt my previously pierced ears were starting to close (I only wore earrings sporadically over the last 2 years), and wearing cheap metals were irritating them.  So I bought this pair mainly for the titanium, so my ears can heal.  They did not irritate at all, I wore them continuously for 3 to 4 weeks.  Now I can wear any earring without problem.  I still wear these to bed.",5
800977,"I love my my glasses holder. It is a smart design that makes me feel like I am protecting my lenses every night, not just balancing them on wood. The lining is so soft, and the design looks great on my bedside table. Knowing what i got, especially for the price,  i couldn't recommend this product more.",5
322988,"It's literally the perfect size for my piercing. I need a tiny ring like this (clitoral piercing) color everything. Looks just like the picture. However -- literally spent 40 minutes trying to get the head back in. I used tweezers, a piercing clamp; everything under the sun. Could not get it back in. I've had this piercing for 12 years plus-- never has such a problem with jewlery. Ever. So now it's just sitting. It's not worth returning; so I guess the seller wins on this one.",1
324816,"I have the light blue cap and it fits perfectly on my big head. Just got the medium blue and dark blue caps today and found that the dark blue one fits ok if I adjust it as large as the little straps allow. however, the medium blue cap will not adjust enough to get a comfortable fit (too tight). To say ""one size fits all"" is not the case. I think I can do some thread and needle custom work to loosen it up so I'm glad this was not an expensive purchase.",3
415406,"The product I received is not the one pictured, It has the brand name ""Amput"" on it, which I found nowhere in the description. It was also scratched on the weighing area-- damage that certainly didn't come from shipping. I can't vouch for it's functionality, for I plan to return it asap. It also smells weird.",1
442593,"I had to order these twice.  The first ones were way too big, and the second ones, ordered at a smaller size, were too big too.  After washing them in hot water, two shrank enough to wear, but the third was still too big.  Don't waste your time.",1
539574,"It's a very nice set. However, the earrings are so thick that I can't put them in my ears, they don't  slide in thru my ears. Also, when the set arrived the first time, it was missing the bracelet. I contacted the seller, and received my bracelet later in a separate shipping free of charge.",3
480641,This is an adorably sweet necklace. I love how the turtle looks and the timepiece hidden behind the shell. The knob to set the time is a little difficult to turn but it keeps such good time I never need to bother with it. It doesn't leave any tarnish marks or a rash either.,5
237011,"While this look very pretty on, they are not made for people with large earloabs. They hurt, and when I got them, they were stuck together, as in welded together. Had to break the two apart, which thankfully they did  not get damaged, except they hurt to wear for any length of time. So, hopefully if you decide to buy, this does not happen to you. And since they come from China, what else can you expect, and to send back would cost as much if not more than your originally paid.",3
198148,"I absolutely love it! It fits just perfect, i read the reviews and that helped me size it. It looks just like the photo and is just as bright! So I'm 5'6 and about 121 lbs and i got a medium, i wear about a 32c and sometimes 34b bra. My pants size is about a 2. I love it. The only reason i gave it 4 stars was because it came in a bit late, and it also smelled heavaly of new clothes smell, it's not bad but not good.",4
841841,"I like the quality of this product.  I had read the reviews and noticed that a few mentioned the product was too small or somewhat small for the
age child they were meant to fit.  So I ordered a larger size - a 2T to fit our very big boy of 14 months and they fit fine.  Will buy the next size up for
the second pair as he is still growing fast.",5
543331,"It doesn't look anything like the picture.  It doesn't hang as freely as the photo they have would suggest.  It has a snug feeling, not because it is small or anything.  The feel of the knit is not so friendly to the touch.  I was really hoping for more.",3
112720,"It is a simple box that holds an acid testing kit. The one that I received is not like the picture in terms of the slots. I have eight slots for acids and a slot that fits a loupe, test stone, and samples. I like the box a lot either way because my acids will be stored upright and out of direct sunlight.",5
573881,"I have a few of the Out of Print T-shirts and they all fit as expected and are great quality. This is the second time I've ordered this particular shirt. Both times it was small for an ex-large, and both times it came in a men/boys crew neck instead of the women's round or scoop neck promised. The second time I ordered it came more than a week late and the image was all smeared. I didn't even take it out of the package. Amazon really should police its sellers better.",1
212945,"Great little wallet. I recently swittched to slimmer fitting jeans so I had to downsize my old Trifold. Its slim, it holds 6 cards with ease in the 3 slots on the left side, I've got another two cards in the flap under and there is issue with bulk or trying to get them out. The ID slot is easily accessible with a cutout in the middle to help slide it in and out. As long as you don't stuff it with too many bills it stays nice and slim. For the price you can't beat it.",5
353192,I received the laces on time in USPS. They look and feel nice. They are 72 inches long and look like the products picture. I am not using them for boot laces. I am using them for a leather tie down on my motorcycle because leather is resistant to engine heat and the color matches the other leather products on my bike. I can not speak to the tensile integrity of the the laces.,5
175893,"I really should not have expected much for $13. I can confirm what other reviewers have noted in the build quality feeling incredibly cheap. Folding the glasses takes a bit of effort and unfolding elicits a ""cracking"" noise that is worrisome. I feel as if I am going to break them. Style-wise, they look great even if they are a bit on the smaller side. If you have a larger head I would avoid. Also--these sunglasses are non-polarizing. Not the best for driving but they'll do for the beach or a day out at an amusement park.",2
696972,"I bought us6/4 and I'm 5'9"" 135lbs This bikini fit my ample-a bust without any strange puckering or extra fabric. Bottoms are super flattering. There is also a subtle mesh detail between the cleavage and on the hip that can't be seen easily in the photos but classes-up the whole thing. Great purchase.",5
811563,"The beads itself are pretty good quality. The material used to hold the beads together is not just a normal string and it holds together really well. I tried twisting it around to break it but it's too tough so I couldn't. Don't be afraid of your wrist/arms being too big for the bracelet since it'll just stretch to your size. Overall, I'm glad I bought this bracelet since it was one of the cheaper ones that was above decent quality and I'm recommending this to anyone that are interested in purchasing bracelets!",5

427368,"I think I expected for these to fit like they do on the model as my legs are of a similar build. However they do not. Instead, they squeeze into the uppermost part of my thigh and honestly I feel pudgy in them. I wanted to look sexy! I wanted to like them more.

You may want to order a 1/2 to a full size up.  The material was a little stiff too and looked like if I had gotten the correct size, it may have cut into my foot...but I'm not sure.  The shoe looks softer in the picture. I love the height of the heel, which is why I gave it a try...I'll keep searching.",2

Anyway- I recommend.",5

They are very long and on the inside of the leg so very noticeable up the inside thigh.",1

I took them out for eating, drinking and smoking. So I'm not sure how that affects them. Overall they were a great buy.",5
575052,"It had perfect measurements. I'm 5'6 weigh 200lbs have stretch marks on my belly. Went to the Dominican Republic for vacation And this outfit was perfect except the top of course.

793448,"So, its a very cute suit. Unfortunately, the bust area is way too big for me so I can't wear it. Its kind of a firm cup that would stick out if you don't have big enough bust to fill it out. I love the boy short bottom, so its disappointing the top doesn't fit",3
349208,"want to like this piece very much as it is extremely delicate and beautiful. even so, the clicker is not well secured and slips in on itself frustratingly far too easily. it also has a bit of a strange construction so that it hands in just a slightly awkward way from the septum though it's so light it doesn't have enough weight centralized to balance itself.",2
657298,"Although I haven't worn them yet, these swim capri's appear that they will work well for those of us that don't care to display thighs at the beach or pool. I returned the first pair for one size larger (20) than my usual (18). I think that is usual for swimwear. Also, they don't  have a panty liner. I took away one star for that reason.",4
806882,"Really cute and good for the price but the chest area was too tight for me. I got a large in the dark blue. I am 5'4 and 140pounds. I wear a size 32C/D. I normally wear a medium/large on top, but since this isn't stretchy I got a large. It pulls funny on my chest so if I order again I'm getting an XL so I'm more comfortable.",4
74061,"I really don't like shiny stuff, so this ring was my attempt to get a wedding ring I would like and wear every day.  Mission accomplished.  It has the nice gunmetal gray to it that some others did not and the brushed finish really tones it down.  Order 1 full size down from what the mall jeweler tells you.",5
123318,"Purchased for 3 yr old daughter. We were surprised with the quality stitching and material for the price.  She loves to put her chap stick, markers and other small toys in her purse and parade around the house. We also purchased a similar one for our niece's birthday. Very pleased with this purchase and will consider this brand again.",5

The grippers are adequate, and keep him from sliding around on our hard wood floors.  I would definitely buy these again.",5
760851,"I bought this boot half a year ago. I really liked the fit but the sole is very slick. I was slipping on wet sidewalks and on snowy/icy sidewalks. I wanted to really like the shoes but I ended up having to abandon them and purchase new ones that had soles that weren't sliding around. They were slick from day one, sadly.",1
801893,"I would not recommend this dress. The material is shiny and cheap. If it was in cotton modal, 5 inches longer in the rear, and the chest/front would stay 'closed' (it was too large) it would've been fabulous. 1 star, for arriving on time. It would cost more than the cost of the dress to ship it back to International location. Therefore, it is at my local consignment store. And yes, I did inquire about an full refund. The seller gave another option.",1
20625,"Kid hates it but I do like the option to make it tighter or looser in the back. recommend buying a rash guard with a hoodie. For some odd reason, my kid didn't pull the hoodie off at all. Probably because nothing is tugging at this neck so it's more comfortable.",3
875894,"I have to return these sadly, they where too big. I am so used to sizing up, and this was my first pair of lucky. Wow the fabric is so soft,it was so comphy on. But when they say curvy fit the mean it. I need a size down but it costs twice as much as of the writing of this review.so sadly I must return and hope to catch the 22 on dale, oh and they do run a little long too. I remember when my inseam 29 was normal. Even at 57 they are a tad long",5

Exactly as pictured. They changed the shipping time after I placed my order but it still arrived in time for the holidays. A fair price until you add in the almost $6.00 charge for shipping. Might order again IF there was free shipping, or a sale.",5
811587,"The quality is exceptional.  I especially like the neckline and the design of the piece.  The fabric is soft and flowing.  The colors are vibrant, just as depicted.  And the embroidery is very lovely.  I wear the top with cropped leggings.  However, if I were younger and had the figure for a short dress, this would suit beautifully.",5
164399,"I would have preferred to find a very small crossbody strap wallet-purse, but there wasn't anything available that met my needs in RFID-secure. Sooo, I bought this instead. The leather is nice; it seems well made, roomy compartments, true to color in the picture. The slots for cards ARE very tight, but I imagine they will loosen up with use. For now, I'm just not sticking things in all the way.",5

The words written on it are gibberish, lol. Just cool looking words in English... ""Free Person at Time""...

The little pocket can't fit most cell phones made after 2007 but it fits compact mice well. Mesh side pockets are great for pens and security access cards.

Really high quality for the price.",5
25023,I like the comfort of the insole and it stays in place. I wish I would have read all what each insole has to offer therefore I would have ordered the correct one. I am still happy either the one bought but I will be purchasing  the one I need now that I know they have such a variety..,5
567199,"Adds a decent layer of warmth for casual temperature changes, from inside to out and back again.  Form fitting so they are not detected under pants.  Only complaint is that there is absolutely no room in the front for male anatomy.  Constricting in the front, but has enough stretch not to be ""gelding"" when sitting.",3
640906,"Nice large vintage style sunglasses.  Bought them for my mom.  These are nice expensive glasses, without the expense.  If you do your research, you will see that this is a top quality brand that typically offer glasses for several hundred dollars.

I have this same pair in black. They're fantastic. This style runs just a little small.  I'm normally in between a small and a medium in workout pants/capris.  Medium is perfect: 5'8 126lb.",5
100097,Very nice quality - have received multiple compliments on it. I travel globally and value the fact that the public isn't always able to see what's nationality I am - that is helpful (as an American traveling in places where Americans may not be viewed very positively).  I would highly recommend this. I think it is very high quality.,5
266794,"I purchased the white in an xs, and for the most part, I absolutely love it.  It is of great quality, the material is thick and not see through.  The fit is perfect, hugs your curves yet it is not restrictive. The only negative is that it is a little too long. I love the fishtail but might hem it off because it's not a length that I love.",5
281063,"Not bad. Strange fit. I have a beer belly and it the waist/chest area fits just fine. However, the sleeves are tight. The material seems pretty good. I will use this mostly for kayak fishing and perhaps some bank fishing. I don't know if it will irritate me casting my line out some many times with the sleeves being snug. I'll update more after testing it out.",3

They have been the best and I've worn them off and on almost 3 years. My new puppy finally chewed thru one of the straps. Believe or not, I fixed it by sewing it together w floss. But this purchase is my second pair and I expect them to do as well as the first! Puppy knows better now.",5

I'm a small-framed person, and haven't gained much weight during my pregnancy, so I can only attribute the poor fit to the design of this garment. If they could tailor it better to the growing belly of a pregnant woman, it'd be a wonderful dress.",2
374482,"This should come with instructions. I have had it a few weeks but have only worn twice because it is hard to understand how to get the same. It is also difficult to use the restroom, so I would advice not wearing this when you expect frequent restroom runs. I like the material and the color for me is fine but not good to wear with pants. Probably should only wear with skirts and dresses so you don't have to unknot and re-knot",3

610305,The chest area is too small in proportion to the size of the dress. It would not zip all the way and I am skinny and smaller chested. and the straps are super cheap looking. The dress is somewhat like the picture but the proportions are off. I recommend getting one size bigger if your willing to make alterations. The dress is a 6.5 out of 10. It has potential but some adjustments are necessary.,3
810049,I usually wear a misses XL ..after reading the reviews purchased an XXL and glad I did shirt definitely runs small! Shirt kin da lays weird in the front around the gathering ..it's blouses out a bit and kinda makes you look like you have roll..however if one has a larger midriff that blousing will camouflage it nicely,3

Doesn't look like the dress in the photo, but still cute

ZIPPER NOT MADE CORRECTLY.. The material is uneven at the top of the zipper. It looks STUPID

Since it is a size too small, I have to give it away :(

124432,"RUNS BIG...Decent quality for what I expected- I guess, still not sure if it's worth price though.
I followed the sizing chart & it was way to big for me. I'd look @ the sizing chart & order the size smaller than it recommends. According to the sizing chart I'd be a size medium. Medium was way to big, small would of probably fit perfect. And the fabric has give some give (stretch) to it, so that should ease your mind if you choose to follow my recommendation of ordering a size smaller than the sizing chart says",3

I'm 5'1 weight about 120. Got it in a small and it was a perfect fit. Perfect length. Not too short and not to long. No adjustment but I was able to use it as a shirt also.,5
277640,"This is an amazing product. I'm 5'4"" and weigh 120Ibs and I got a size small and it fits perfect. The reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because one of the middle hooks came kind of loose and after wearing it once it came undone and is now barely hanging on by a thread. It looks like it might fall off soon. Also the the smell but you get use to it lol. Overall it's a great product and fits to size. I would recommend to anyone looking for a great waist trainer",4
576307,I love the coat!! Very warm an cozy!  But I ordered it 1x because I'm between large and 1x.  I figured it would be better loose than tight!  But I definitely didn't need the extra room.  But I kept it anyway because I hate returning things!!!,4
578429,"I purchased these socks on a lightning deal. They are stylish to the point where multiple people have commented and asked me where I bought them. The material is soft, thick cotton. I've washed these multiple times and the colors have not faded. The size is PERFECT! I wear a size 12 shoe and these come up to no mid calf. They are snug and don't slide down during the day, yet they aren't too tight and constricting. I'd have to say that these are my favorite socks of all time. I will be buying them often.",5

I got many compliments that night on the dress. If you are still debating on weather or not to purchase this.. BUY IT! You will not regret it!",5
563574,I have an hour-glass figure with a small belly.  If you have a short torso and a small belly it looks weird because it's tight around your belly and loose above it where your waist is smaller.  The length isn't as flattering on me with the short torso.  Love this shirt otherwise and will probably get it altered to remove some length.,3
389133,"the size is great - not too big nor too small. You can fit a good amount of stuff inside.
There's also 1 big pocket and 2 small pockets inside. 2 in the front and 1 at the back. Which is good in separating and organizing things.
The bag handle is made of strong and nice material.
The bag is made of multiple layers of materials which made it thick/strong enough and also able to retain its shape after putting things in.
The color is nice, the same as in the photo.",3
526357,I bought three of these just for around the house. they are too large in the armpits in my bra sticks out. I am able to alter them on the sewing machine and that took care of the issue but I really didn't want to have to buy something that I had to alter.,3
44650,These boots look a little too costumey to wear out and about for my tastes. Would wear for like a bat girl costume though. If you're not used to wearing shoes like this you may be uncomfortable after wearing them for a while. I have slim legs so they fit me okay and aren't too tight around the top. But if your calves are on the bigger side you may consider looking for something else. The deliver was quick and the packaging was fine. Good buy for cosplay and other stuff like that.,3
814213,I am extremely pleased with this dress!  It arrived quickly and in great shape along with bonus jewelry from the seller!  I took advice of previous reviewers on ordering a size down and I am glad I did because the dress fits great.  This turned out to be a fabulous buy!!  I got a beautiful wedding dress for half the price of my fiance's tux rental!  Looking forward to looking like a princess at my wedding next month.,5

High insight, I'd go one size larger because it does have draw strings, that appear to be nylon, so the sides can be drawn in to fit better. But, I have to admit, the overall fit is sexy and it looks good on me. I simply could not do better for what I paid.",4

However, I will caution that if you have any sort of belly fat you need to wear Spanx or some other supportive undergarment as the dress is tight in that area and will definitely emphasize that particular bodily feature.

766037,"Bought this for my sister and it didn't fit her at all size was too small. What a disappointment, she was going to use it as part of a costume and now has to borrow from a friend. I got a medium for her. But didn't fit and all her pants are medium size.",1
317617,Nice looking ring.  Leans more towards wedding band.  The blue topaz is a VERY pale blue and the CZ quality is not as good as I was expecting.  But it's still a nice looking ring at a disposable price.  You can tell up front that this ring will not stand to constant wear and I fully expect the CZs to discolor after a few months.,4
829792,First I got this shirt and it's way more see through then it looks. I was expecting cotton and got poor quality fabric. Second I ordered the smallest size they had and it says it runs small so if anything I thought it would end up to small but it was way to large and very long in the front. Lastly I wanted to return it abe can't because they want me to pay more then what I paid for the shirt to send it back. Won't shop with them again.,1
593755,"Cute blouse. It's sort of what I've been looking for in an open shoulder blouse but I didn't  really like the panel material. So I cut it out instead and now the blouse is more like an open arm one. I'm modifying it so that it will be a cold shoulder blouse. Other than that, it's made nicely! I would advise ordering one size up.",4
114639,"It gives you the smooth hold you want. Only two problems:

1. Don't wear without a bra or at least some cups. It'll give your breasts a weird shape under your clothes if you wear it braless.
2. The bottom clips hurt.

I usually wear this with baby t shirts and jeans so I don't look like I drank two gallons of water. LOL. So I usually don't button the bottom. I may cut the snaps off and attach two some shorts or full cover panties.",3
539679,"i got this 26 days after i ordered it and let me tell you... THE WAIT WAS WORTH IT!! it fits just as i expected and its very light and not constrictive. It has a lot more blue than i expected, but all the same its still very lovely :)",5
705817,"I loved this sweater when it arrived, the fit is great and the color is exactly as pictured. The problem was that the buttons on the side fell off right away, and there was a hole in the arm. It looked as though it was sewn weird. I returned mine, I am going to order another and hope the quality is a little better.",3
789126,This product came incredibly late and to top it off the pants were 3 sizes too big. My daughter won't be able to wear them until she's two. The shirt is good material however I am unable to pair them with the pants as I would like.  Overall I don't buy not worth it.,1
415989,"I was a bit skeptical about purchasing this ring at first, but i'm so glad I did!!!!!! I lost my wedding ring so as a replacement I ordered this one. Yes, the product is inexpensive but it's the symbolism behind it that matters. I wasn't expecting much but after receiving my package,  DAYS earlier than the estimated arrival date, I was very pleased. The entire ring sparkles and fits perfectly. I am 110% satisfied!",5
285842,"Terrible product! Do not buy! I wasn't even able to wear these once. When they came the backs were bent flat so they couldn't be worn. I had to bend them out to the original shape to wear them and the post completely broke off one of the earrings. So I'm left with one earring, and the other with a broken post so I was unable to even wear them",1
804291,"This was really just too cheap to worry about sending back, so I didn't bother. The flowers were obviously made for being on a stem for house decorating. the back of the flower was pointed and hot glued onto the clip, which had teeth  on the part that is supposed to slide into your hair, so it unsurprisingly snagged and pulled my hair when I put it in and took it out.

I ended up throwing this in the garbage and finding a better flower clip at a local Claire's.",1
335839,"I loved the skirt at first and when I wore it for the 1st time it was beautiful, even flick it was too big. The 2nd time I put it on I noticed  the waistband came loose. I washed per instructions and the fabric is not very good quality.",1
88265,"These glasses arrived in a very small box.  Since they were smushed in the box, they were all bent and/or damaged.  Upon trying them on, they didn't look very much like the images on the purchase page.  Like others have said, the mirrored lenses are very dark and make the clarity of the glasses pretty poor.  I returned them and didn't mind paying the shipping costs to send them back.  That's how much I disliked them.",1
737310,"The specs are off and therefore the sleeves are incorrectly made, way too small and therefore way too tight which is abnormal and not supposed to be the case and a coat or jacket and this is a 100% fact. I had read this in the reviews before I purchased it and now have received it and agree especially from the standpoint of being a fashion designer. I will be returning this jacket.",1
870136,The wallet is really cute but does not fit a lot. I cannot use the coin purse and have all the cards I need in it at the same time (Debit cards/ DL/ Insurance Cards). I still like it and just moved all the cards I don't use on a daily basis to a pocket in my purse. :),4
102481,"This was the first time purchasing t-shirts on line.  I usually get them at a department store.  These are not as soft or thick as what I'm used to.  Apparently there are levels of quality i.e.: comfortsoft, our most comfortable, etc.  I will check more carefully next time.",4
155352,Looks and feels cheap. Have only used for about two weeks and the corners started to bend out. The card slots seem cheap but held up well for the two weeks. I have since trashed it as the corners were bending out and looked as if it would fall apart in me.,2
313230,"These are great easy tops! Fabric did not seem to thin to me (I read previous reviews). I am 5'10 and about 200 lbs. Normally I wear a L to XL. Based on reviews I purchased a 2XL which seemed big but it fit PERFECTLY. So definitely size up. They are nice and long which tall girls understand can be hard to find! I will definitely buy more of these tops, arrived relatively quickly as well.",5
671443,"I adore this necklace. As a Game of Thrones super fan, I bought this because Daenerys is my favorite. It's the perfect size, the dragon is adorable, and the quality of the necklace is amazing. It shipped super fast, and arrived in great packaging. I will definitely be buying more necklaces from this seller..thank you so much! I get so many compliments on my new necklace :)",5
451744,I was very happy with this camisole style shaper (although it's more of a tank top style as the straps are wide enough to cover bra straps.. It was slightly ruched in the front and cut high enough on the back of the top to cover a wide bra band. Smoothing without constricting. I bought both colors. Worked very well even under thin knit tops.,5
446668,"I ordered Large size because I'm around 200 pounds...OK, I'm fat, I know, but this is to large for me..the quality is very nice, soft and the color its shinny a little bit...I found a consumer immediately and because I liked the pullover I ordered another but Medium size...Take in consideration that the size what you will order will be more with one size then what you wear..",4
308373,"I have purchased 4 of these in different colors. When I first saw it in person I thought it was the prettiest scarf I had ever seen. I'm not exaggerating, and no one is paying me to say this. This design is beautiful. My favorite is the cream colored one, as shown in the photo.  It's real silk too. It looks wonderful with a dress or sweater of any solid color.  I love mine.",5
537994,"Sooo cute and plenty long, covers most of toosh. I usually wear a small, but bought s large for my DD boobs and it fits great. I can even close the clasp. I could have gone with a medium but wouldn't have been able to clasp front. It's cute either way, opened or closed.",5
371909,Glasses fit a bit snug behind the ears but not so tight that it causes a headache or become uncomfortable. Not as dark and I would like and lenses give a bluish tint. Very lightweight and love the fact they have a 2 year warranty. All in all for the price these are a great option!,4
402196,"As a hostess for a busy high end restaurant I have to look good and fashion can be painful on the feet. Standing all night is a killer. Desperate for a feel good shoes I bought these. WOW.
SO comfortable and look just great with all my black outfits.

I would recommend these to anyone.",5
86521,"This dress is truly stunning. It fits just as expected and feels soft to the skin. Everyone loves the pretty collar. It's so cute.  Wore it to my work Christmas party and they made me strand in the front of the picture as 'Mrs. Clause', of course it helped that I accessoried with a wide black belt. ;-)",5
524870,"Very sexy. However, after a couple uses the ankle strap did tear off. That's why I'm rating 3 stars. I was so disappointed! I still wear them...just walk more carefully, and I'm not that bummed because it's easy to find strap replacements. I love the blush metallic though, I get compliments on them all the time.",3
79011,Looks better on site. It's made in China and after wearing it twice it unravelled.  The rhinestones are not shiny at all. It is fragile as it is too skinny and hard to take on and off.  It should only be $5.  Also the back rusted. I would not recommend it and will be contacting the vendor. This all happened within 1 week after the purchase.,1
761170,"I am very excited to try this on the beach, it fits lovely and the bottoms fit great too! The bikini top does have padding but i'm a pushup girl so I'm happy with it! Only complaint, the colors are way more vibrant then the pics show. I ordered the rose and is came as more a hot pink.",5
88246,"The glasses are nice and pretty sturdy for the cheap price, but they aren't what I was expecting... According to the pic they are more of a matte mirrored finish and that's what I was looking for, but when they showed up they were just the regular mirror finish, still nice glasses though...",3
227139,"I like the style, it runs very very small. The sleeves are supposed to be long but on me, they are more like 3/4 sleeves. Also the material is not 100% cotton, so it does not breathe well. That's on me though, I should've checked the material before I bought. Over all, this tshirt looks ok, but I wouldn't buy another one.",3
347223,"The Med (US small) was way too big...the sleeveless version. I am 5'3 123 Ibs... 34-26-37 the top (near the side of breasts) as well as the mid back bunched to leave gaps making the dress look odd. Not sure if it was just faulty sewing or a size issue, yet reviews said to order a size up & this was the smallest available.",2
360790,"This is wayyyyy tooooo big!!  Unless you have very large ankles, don't bother buying this!  Disappointed as it is very pretty, but unfortunately I can't wear it!  Asked for a refund and they gave me $1.00 back.  Wow......  Oh well, at least it was cheap enough to not lose sleep over!",2
399417,"I bought this case for my 80GB iPod Classic. It fits fine. I had problems with the silicone covering the click wheel. The click wheel wasn't sensitive enough to work properly so I got a box cutter and cut out the silicone that was covering the click wheel. ITS GREAT!! I am VERY happy I didn't spend another $20 on a different case.
Also, this came with a plastic screen protector. It is hard to put on without getting bubbles under it but it actually doesn't interfere with the screens view.",4
123343,My two year old daughter loves this purse. If we're ever missing something this is one of the first places we check because she puts everything in there! It's very well built and seems like it will stand up to heavy use and even multiple runs through the washing machine.,5
28541,"I have plantar fascitis and I have tried so many different inserts and shoes it makes my head spin - these are by far the best for the money - they do the job and do it well.  My podiatrist recommended them - these can fit in almost any shoe that has enough depth and they really, really, help your foot.",5
446816,"For the price you can't go wrong! It was a hit amongst all the other dresses that evening. Everyone had paid in the 100's for their dress but not me.
the color is fabulous, a true red which is hard to find. Very light weight which makes it easy to dance and especially sit. Overall I love it!",5
624094,"I was really nervous about the quality and size of the top, but I read other reviews and chose an XXX large (I normally wear a US large or XL) and I'm so glad I did! Looks great, wish it was a softer material but it's super cute. I want a red and purple one!",4
644747,"This is a very cute dress it is true to size. even though it is a beach dress I wear a tank under it and where it out in public because, it's so pretty and the colors are so bright it looks like a dress. I get lots of compliments on it.",5
304544,"The swim dress is of excellent quality!  The sizing is probably fine too.  I am a bit small for the 6-8 and a bit large for the 4-6.  I went with the larger because I probably won't ever get wet anyway.  If I was a water person, I would probably have got with the smaller since they usually get baggier when wet.  I would certainly recommend the sit for style and quality.",4
458372,"The perfect sunglasses if you want to show out. The lenses are also really reflective. Too dark for inside use (for all the dusches out there)  Only problem i had was i wasn't sure how these would look from the two pictures that they gave. Also the screws on the arms were a little too tight (easy fix). Overall, great product!",5
439480,"Awesome glasses, Got these to replace some Oakleys I had lost at the beach, Didn't want to pay $150.00 again so was looking when I came across the Natives, Like them lots better than the old Oakleys. They will fog a little when working but not half as bad as the old glasses I had. Would recommend and buy again.",5
49520,"It gets a crease in it if you sit or wear it for more then about 3 hours. Its great for right after you have a baby but I only wore it for about 4 days. Its something you can wear while your standing, but if sitting it get a crease in it, when the wrap is suppost to stay stiff/straight",3
855901,"It is a bit sheer, so be sure to wear a slip or undetectable undergarments. Of course if you are dark like me DEFINITELY go with a slip. Other than that, it is super cute and fits well. I am 123lbs and 4'11 and decided to try the M. It is a little short but fits just fine everywhere else. 10/10 would recommend as it is a nice summer or spring look that is easy to work as something laid back, or dressed up.",5
31136,"These are loose fitting on the legs, as others have noted.  But I find that comfortable.  The length is a bit long because the elastic at the ankles is also quite loose.  I wish there were pockets.  But then, for the price, they are a great deal.  Just make sure you have somewhere safe and convenient for your keys/wallet/phone/whatever while wearing these.",3
46865,"I should have been on notice, since the reviews were so diverse.  I cannot wear these due to the discomfort of having my ears being pinched by the snap-on mechanism.  Plus, they really don't feel like they are very secure.  Sending them back. I guess I will go with the old-school ear muffs.",1
267339,"They are super soft which scared me at first, thinking they woukd tear or something, but they are actually pretty strong and elastic. I usually buy underwear in M, but i bought these in L, AND THEY FIT AMAZINGLY. So if you're thinking on buying a pair, or two (like I did) DO IT, you will not regret it. BUT remember to go up 1 size to what you usually wear, ok.",5
436738,The jacket was somewhat ok but the sleeves were kid of long and the pants were to small in the upper leg (thigh) area which made it uncomfortable to where. Would've returned it for a refund but it was too close to Halloween so we had to make it work.,3
106144,"looks like an olive oil dress or 70's spinster outfit.... be aware of the details that cause this look... I made myself wear it for a day just to learn the lesson if ""unfortunate Amazon purchases"" .. the friends and family had a good laugh. May work for ugly sweater party though- you will win.
  Also, dress shrinks one full size when washed, which worked for me as it was too large, hope this helps.",2
127798,"It fit perfectly - the costume is well made aside from the roughly done details for the paint on the little parts on the front which isn't really noticeable. Besides that though, everything fit as expected and I love it. I purchased this for Rhode Island Comic Con and I'm excited to wear it.",4
374918,"Very thin, lightweight shell, highly visible color. Inside is well laid out. Only 4 stars because of 2 staple points sticking into the inside of the case at the joint of the zipper closure, 1 on the top, 1 on the bottom. Was able to push them over enough not to snag skin or clothing.

During these extra-chilly New England days lately, it's been great to keep them close.  Also, my mom knits the mittens, so it's rotten when we lose one:) and she doesn't like the choking hazard idea of the old-school string.",5
114873,"Bought these as a backup to the first CliC glasses I bought in 2012. I have used and abused my original glasses on a daily basis and they are still going strong, just are very worn. Good product much better than what you get off the rack in the department store.",5
809179,"Was way too big even though I ordered based on their measurements. Was not fitted, looked like a sack. I returned it and did NOT get another. I like some GownTown stuff, but this was just cheap slick polyester fabric and I did NOT like it at all. No structure at all.",1
704610,"I loved this outfit, however it fit too small. The small skirt is really sized for an x-small. The small top was slightly large. The sizing proportions just seemed WAY off! But, the fabric was smooth and the white colors matched on both pieces I received. Too bad it didn't fit and I had to send it back!",3
569852,Fit perfect for my gorgeous plus sz 16!! With room to be comfortable!! Is a beautiful dress & looks much more expensive than cost!!  I had ordered 3 other dresses from a mall store...at 100$ each to get the best fit & dress. This was the best by far!!! Love this brand!!,5
120866,"I loved the hat, just wish they made the sizes a little bit smaller instead of a hat 0 to 6 months which of course is going to be big for a newborn . But maybe if they did one like 0 to 3 months so it would have a better chance of fitting.",4
701986,"The only complaint that I have is that there are no pockets. That is the only negative about this item.

Fits perfectly. The shorts isn't too long or short. It's a right length for me.

I ordered the green one and I love it. The short isn't as dark as I thought it would be, which is ok with me.

Item came faster than expected. I think I'll purchase from them again.",4
647345,"The top of the dress is a little large. I shortened the straps all the way. I'm glad my mother is a seamstress! The pattern is as shown. The material feels cheap, but what can you expect for the price?! Shipped fast. Wear skin-tone undergarments or they will show through.",4
402177,"I bought this ring for $50 around the holiday, and it's so cute that I would've gladly paid the retail price!
The chain is quite thin, but I wear it all the time and am sure it will last. The star is about the size of a nickel, which I am really happy about.
Everywhere I go I get compliments on it. Definitely a good investment!",4

231206,Hubby can't be more happy since being introduced to saxx underwear. He's not one to be picky st all and was skeptical about paying so much for one pair but quickly decided they were well worth the money! No more adjusting or trying to unstick if you know what I mean.,5
188203,Extremely small! The material is cheap and I noted there is no size tag anywhere on the material. I gauged it at a size medium and was right.

Fits about 25 business cards, give or take. And by the way, packaging is not what is pictured. It's the package that it comes with if you were to order it directly from Kate Spade. The brown pouch in a Kate Spade box. Nice but just don't expect a bow.",5
177372,"I am very pleased with this dress! Still wearing it at 7 months pregnant! Getting to the point where I may stop though, it is a material that tends to show a lot. Nice length (I'm 5'4"", so it's harder to find maxi dresses that are). Cute, comfy and easy to throw on!",5

698449,"Amazing quality for the price, I'm very impressed. I originally got this red little number to be part of a betty boop costume but it seems more like a quality party dress a little too fancy for a dress up Halloween costume but im not going to complain that a product was ""too high quality"" bc that would be arbitrary lol. ten to ten I would buy again if I needed a dress for a wedding or something. a really great buy all in all especially for the price",5
724396,Exactly as I had seen and imagined. Falls very well and doesn't swing around when walking. Well made and nice seams. It has the faintest wiff of some chemical but then that's expected when the material is not leather. But the smell goes away in a day. Even though it doesn't have a zip I don't feel worried about things falling out as the shape of the bag makes the magnetic closure sufficient.,5
810976,I love the dress! It is super sexy. I thought it was more of a bbq/ family event type summer dress. It is a wrap around. The top of your breast will show some what. You will see your whole thigh when you sit or walk. If you are looking for a date night dress or you are really daring then I would order it at your regular size. If you want a bbq/ family summer dress then order a size up.,5

The only problem that I wish I had paid closer attention to is the graphic imaging. It's a personal preference, nothing wrong with the shirt itself, but there are multiple religious symbols on the top, all to do with the occult. Something to be aware of.",4

I am 5'4"" and it's too short also I fit in size 6 pants and the leg opening is too small. The worst is the pocket placement, might as well not have any pockets. The pockets are a good 8"" from the waistband. Not a good purchase, run away.",1

I ordered a large. I doubt the jacket could fit a large woman or a large 12 year old. It was a waste of money, I  cant wear it. Again, if the price is too good to be true, it is. You will likely get what you pay for. Don't fall for the okey doke, like me.",1

I love it so much I messaged the seller asking where I could get more!  My hair is super thick and long and this band has just the right amount of elasticity and the material is thicker than a normal tie so it doesn't pull my hair out.  The cost is definitely more than I'd normally pay but its worth the price keeping your hair up, in place and damage-free.",5
476691,I ordered the wine colored and I really like how it looked when I received it. I didn't have any problems with the fit as I think this coat runs small so I ordered up a size.

527032,"Wouldn't wear it to the store (too thin) but for wearing around the house in summer (why I bought it) it is perfect. I was looking for the lightest material I could find, but still breathable. This is it. It also does NOT touch my neck; I can't stand anything touching my neck, and this is perfect. Sleeveless, good length (not too long or short) Almost feels like I'm not wearing anything, which is what I need in the heat of summer. Pretty colour also (as pictured.)",5

The legs in particular were uncomfortably tight as there is no give or stretch to the material. There was loose fabric that bunched in the tummy/crotch area - very unflattering. I am a true size 4; at 5'4"" 120 lbs, I ordered a size small. I considered trying a medium but ultimately decided against it.

when I put them on everything was blurry. My husband and friends had the same problems.

675289,Was a bit hesitant to purchase at first but glad I did. The quality is top notch and the pin itself has great detail. I was a bit worried it wouldn't be detailed as the picture but was pleasantly surprised when I received it. The item has two pins and holders that ensure this item doesn't spin around - that was another concern I had. Would recommend to anyone especially for the price!,5

We are an adventuresome family and it was perfect for situations where you don't get the chance to make a full change after getting wet, water fall hikes, beach camping, you get the idea. Flattering feminine fit. Oh and long enough. I'm not a fan of boxy short shirts. I am 5-7 and 140 lbs.",5
537977,"For starters it's more silver then camel and kind of has a cousin it look. It is all one color but it is a decent price, I've looked around and for the same type it's double to price.  It is better made then I thought it was going to be, it has pockets and is lined on the inside nicely and it long but tight. I am 4'11 about 105 lbs and I like that it fits length wise like the picture but doesnt close up with out being a little snug.",3

Docker's stretch belts bite.  Don't waste your money",2

I've never had any type of skin irratition either. People frequently ask me about it because they like the looks of it. I highly recommend it. Their warranty is also great, although at this point I doubt I'll ever need to use it.",5
426549,"This watch looks as good as it does on the Amazon website, and I love it already! The design is classic and it is lightweight and easy to get on and off. And I am very happy about the lifetime battery replacement guarantee. The service was outstanding--I ordered it online last Thursday and received it today (Monday), well-packaged and in perfect condition. I would highly recommend this watch and this vendor to anyone who wants classic design and good value.",5
779657,"I know these are for men, but i bought these for myself. I just like wearing these around the house because it's comfortable. with that said,  the material is stretchy and soft against your skin.

They were exactly what I was looking for.",5
79909,"This ring is exactly what I wanted- a ring I could wear as a wedding band for those times I do not want to ruin my real wedding set.

553427,"Good customer service in resolving an issue I had with the size. If you are planning on buying this product, I suggest to consider the size. The size is notably smaller than expected. As for the product, the jacket is a nice color green and is good quality. The design is quite nice and matches well with the colors, especially green. I'd reccomend this product and the seller especially",5
101763,This dress was very nice for the price. I'm 4'9 and 100lbs and the xsmall fit perfectly. Of course the top doesn't actually go down my shoulders like in the picture but it fits so well and looks so nice with the scrunchy neck I don't care. And I'm grateful others described their body type so that I was able to pick the best size for me. Overall I love this dress.,5

Although there was a tag on the dress indicating if removed, dress could not be returned, this dress had been previously worn as was evident by the stain in the center of the back of the dress. I should have paid attention to the other reviews with regards to the sticking zipper. Will need to replace zipper to correct problem.",2

I have to make a V-cut into it on the front to loosen it up and unfortunately couldn't cut hardly more than an inch because the graphics are situated so high on the front, it wouldn't have cut into the graphics. I made it work but still the neckline is weird.",4

812328,"This somehow fit me surprisingly well considering I am more ""pear shaped"" body-wise. It manages to look cute and not too matronly. But there's gonna be cleavage everywhere, for sure.

I did not get a replacement as I did not like having it sitting out on display.  Cheap looking as well as not working for me.  I now pick up the watch every other day or so to personally wind it up. My watch is a Seiko Kinetic, which I have found out do not wind in these types of winders.",1
18285,Bought a grey 6-18 month one of these over a year ago and I still love it. Great size that my son wore from 12 months and is still wearing at 30+ months. Wanted one for my daughter and bought a lavender 9-18 month one because that was all that was available. The 9-18 month one is so much smaller than the 6-18 month one. Doesn't make sense. I was very disappointed.,1
37658,"I bought them and didn't try the on until a month later. Unfortunately they are not what I expected. They are huge and they don't have pockets. I usually order my sweats in size large, because they tend to shrink. They look like I was a kid in the 90s wearing my dad's pants.",3

282014,Very happy with this purchase! This backpack is perfect for outings with my toddler since she loves to walk and run around it helps keep me hands free. The outside pocket is padded and the perfect size for me to keep my kindle! I would definitely recommend this backpack to anyone!,5
747466,"I'm very happy with this purchase. Being a man I'm always a little worried about bracelets, especially if they are described as unisex, but I have to say this is really substantial and it fits great even though my wrist is not small. You can really feel the weight of the piece and it looks great. It also arrived on time and in a really nice package if you want to give it as a gift. Based on the quality and price I will likely be buying future pieces from this vendor.",5

My 26 year old son who is very picky about what he wears also said it was a nice hat and wants one for the beach.",5

However, I was slightly disappointed by the fact that they aren't completely opaque, but rather somewhat transparent. They also were much smaller than I anticipated, and difficult to put on and take off. However, they looked great for my dance, and the service was great! Take warning if you have big hands, though--- these are more flattering on tiny hands.",3

Could have probably gotten away with a size 8 but I was afraid it would be to small. So I would say it's pretty true to its size chart . Definitely follow your bust measurements . Dress is pretty, a little wrinkled , but overall for the price I'm pretty happy.  My daughter loves the dress.",3

The opening of the square neck area is much larger than in the photo making it feel like it is barely sitting on your shoulders.  It runs extremely small.  I ordered a size medium, I usually wear a size small.  Also was not happy with the shipper.  It was supposed to arrive between August 9 - 12.  It didn't arrive until August 15th.",1

He wears 4T clothes, but is skinny and has no booty. These run bigger in the behind than the 4T Gymboree brand underwear which seem to fit him better.",4

I've tried many different types and brands of nipple covers, many have given me rashes or just don't adhere correctly and you can still see them, but these are practically invisible under any clothing. I've even worn them under my white bikini top at the beach and in the water and they were still there and sticky after returning home and washing them off. The case is great too for travel.",5

I instantly had to take it out and put my retainer ring back in due to an infection since the product is ""Plated"" the plating started coming odd revealing it was not even painted very well, it's copper and fake surgical steel. NOT worth the money",1

I like to wear it under dresses or tight clothes to give myself a little extra ""umph""! The only reason I'm subtracting one star is because I didn't feel it made my behind as large as I was led to believe it would  in the photo. It's still great and I wear it all the time though! I love the way it adds definition to my waist and makes me look like I have a hourglass figure.",4

594176,Very very pretty. Looks better than I thought this set would. Gifted my mom with it. Might have to get another for myself.  Nice purchase at a bargain price ( wish the earring posts were a little sturdy though and the ring is a little fragile looking).  I would definitely recommend this.,4
513895,"If i could give zero stars I would. Do not order this.  Horribly made.  To say this runs small would be generous.  Its about two sizes smaller than normal. If you order a medium, they send you an extra small, type deal.  The stitching is so bad you can gently pull on the scem and the thing streches and falls apart.  Very disapointed.",1
610070,"Beautiful Sneakers but the seller left the MSR (Manufacturers Suggested Retail) and it stated $75. I was mortified. With shipping I paid almost $200 for these sneakers. On the flip side, they are gorgeous. My almost two year old gets compliments on them constantly. They are super easy to clean. All in all, I don't regret the purchase- I regret the fact that amazon would allow a seller to double the price of a pair of sneakers. I might as well have gone on e-bay.",3

I can't find it and I'm upset that that piece could even fall out.",3

118508,"This dress is so cute, just a little snug! I'm usually a 10 or 12, so I ordered a 12, and it's just a bit too tight. I'm a very hourglass figure, though, so it could just be my shape. But I do like it and hope that when I lose a little more weight it'll fit well. If you are busty, I'd recommend going a size up.",4
360044,"Great quality. Great customer service. Great product. Highly recommend these sunglasses. Not only are the well made but they are a great conversation piece, which is a nice bonus. Only had them for a few weeks and have had several people ask where I've got them. Will definitely be buying more pairs in the future.",5
700624,"Great idea for a product, but terrible execition and cheap. Within 2 days of using on our trip the zippers on both pouches we bought broke. Then on day 3, my entire pouch ripped at the top seam and I could no longer use it. My wife's also ripped at several places along the seams. I would not buy this product due to how cheaply made it is and how quickly it fell apart. There was no abnormal wear and tear, literally just unzipping and zipping the pouch caused it to rip at nearly every seam immediately.",1
85825,The quality of the belt is great. It looks like an expensive belt. Only thing to watch is the sizing...I wear a 38W trousers so I got an XL but since the belt is expandable an XL leaves to much belt and it flops over. If I had known I would have bought a Large and everything would be fine. Only way for me to wear this is to put a couple inches on my waist. Expensive solution for an inexpensive belt.,5
636024,"I will say that I LOVE the look of this dress, the lace is very nice. However when I tried wearing it I couldn't stand the feel of the inner lining. It may be that I have sensitive skin but I couldn't stop itching, the material was so scratchy! Not only was it scratchy but the arms were so tight that I couldn't really life my arms. When I ordered this dress it ONLY came in small which I didn't think would be a problem because I generally wear small but this was pushing it even for me.",2
114191,"This is a exquisite piece of jewelry from a quality seller. The comments about the chain from other reviewers is misguided at best. The white gold chain is delicate, not fragile. The chain shouldn't take away from the focus of the piece. Fabulous perfectly round pearl. Couldn't have asked for better at twice the price. I shopped local stores and found similar for a lot more money. This is a jeweler I can trust and will go to them first in the future.",5
112855,"I sort of knew this was going to be a bit of a joke when I bought them. No illusions. I wanted to wear them with the stupid one piece blanket i had bought before. Worth  a pic on facebook. But these are SOOOOOO bad, I couldn't even justify the few dollars. Should be sold through TOYSRUS as a toy for tots. If you live in a highrise, open your balcony door, take the money out of your wallet and let the wind carry it away. Way more fun and value than zoomies.",1
684879,"Beautiful jacket for the fall/spring. Definitely go up a size, I am 5' 8 and 155 lb and usually a medium, but I got a L in this jacket given all of the other reviews about the snug fit. Even with the L, it is a little tight around my bust, so if you're bustier, I'd definitely recommend going up a size. Otherwise, this is a great light jacket and the price is fantastic.",5
141889,"At first glance, the bag looked great. It was a great size (not so big that I'd lose stuff in it), and I really liked the color. But when I further inspected the inside, I realized that half of the lining hadn't been sewn/attached to the bag. The stitching went around one half and then completely stopped, which meant that the lining was completely detached. Very poor workmanship. Even though it's an inexpensive bag, I still expect it to be sewn properly.",1

93203,love the idea of these shorts and by far are the only ones i came across that i really love. I would recomend a size bigger that you wear. I needed these swim shorts for coverage and although it is spandex i feel the bottom leg of the shorts they should of made them a little bit for loose so when you wear them and sit down your flesh is not buldging out making your leg look for fat. otherwise these are very good shorts.,3
821424,"This product is terrible. I ordered size large and it fits my 23 month old just below the knee. Also, the shirt does not have a label; therefore, I don't know the actual size of the shirt. It came packed in the bag without any receipt or label. Do not buy. Terrible product.",1
703386,"Based on quality alone, I must give these four stars. They look good, are well made and have progressive dimming which fits perfectly into my daily lifestyle.

For the price, I am sure that one could find better sunglasses. That said, these are Rayban and I understand that I paid for the name.

Only downside is that Amazon says these were made in America, RayBan says they were made in China and the glasses have ""made in Italy"" written on them. Nothing wrong with this, but I was trying to buy American.",4

805379,The bathing is a lot cuter in your hands but runs short in the attached bottoms.  It's like it's been sewed too short and with not enough material.  I feel like I have somewhat of a wedgy I'm going to be returning it only because they don't have a bigger size.  Too bad because for the price it's not bad.  Listen to all the other reviews and when they say it runs one size to small.,3

Good:
1. The girl pattern is adorable and there are some subtle bedazzling to the hair that I didn't notice when I ordered it.
2. Nice and soft, comfortable fit

Bad:
1. The white ruffle on the sleeve makes me think of a linebacker. Haha (still debating if its quirky enough to grow to like). However, my daughter loves it (puffy sleeves and all).",4

407193,This DVD Game is really bad.  You have to solve problems with the DVD remote control which the games does not respond to at all.  You press a control button and a minute later something happens which of course is too late.  Have not made it past the second clue.  Don't waste your money on this game.  How do I go about getting my money back on this one.,1
147832,Bought this ring to replace my wedding band than had a carbon fiber inlay that was starting to turn yellow. I never take off my ring so the yellowing is in part probably from me getting it dirty. I'm happy to turn back to a simpler time and just have a solid ring I don't have to worry about turning colors on me. Comfortable ring overall. Id recommend,5
515121,Alright so it shipped fast to be coming from China but these look so.... I don't even have a word for it. You can't tell these are handcuffs at all. It just looks like two hoops latched together. Where the keyhole should be is just a circle. I'm disappointed but I guess you get what you pay for. Spend your money and time else where.,1
259331,"I bought the L size. It was a little tighter around the arms and neck than other HD clothes I've previously bought. Given that it is ""performance"" type clothing, I expected the fit to be a little closer rather than loose. However, the cut around the neck can get uncomfortable. Other than that, I do like the shirt. It looks great and I also like the reflective print. I would wish that there was some reflective lining on the back as well so that drivers could see the rider from the back as well.",4

Will keep you posted!",5
593856,I purchased this for my daughter to use as part of a minion girls costume. I have always preferred to make or put together Halloween costumes instead of purchasing a store costume. The color was true and it definitely matched the minion yellow! It worked great and kept her warm on a chilly trick or treat night. The fit was slightly small though expected for a baby/toddler hat...and my daughter has a large head at two and half years old so maybe it is that her head is big instead of the hat running slightly small.,4
480833,It doesnt fit exactly as what it is on the picture. The strings were sewn far from each other which made spaces larger as compared to the dress that model is wearing. I had to cut some strings and sew it again for the sake that i would have not thrown money i spent for this dress. Such a hassle.,2
464866,What good is a pin without the back?  I bought this item to add to my son's collection.  What a disappointment!  Toy Box Collectors Shop should have indicated that the backs are sold separately.  I'm not sure if they are but they weren't included in my shipment.,1
569592,Its a good thick sweater. Havent been cold since I got it. Its just a little shorte in length than Id like. Im 6 3 and its rides high on the waist. Id have given 5 stars if theyd make them 2 or 3 inches longer. Overall a tough sweater thatll work great under your coat or over.,4

It zips and yet it has room to breathe and adjust to fit your figure perfectly! Love love it! Highly recommend! (and I don't usually post reviews!),5
52565,"I do like this hat a lot for our 2 1/2 year old.  But the brim is a little on the large/floppy side.  I am all about keeping the sun off his face, but to the point where it blocks his vision?  The hat needs to sit a little back on his head so he can see, but then if he runs or there is wind, the brim will just blow upward, defeating its purpose.  Just wish the brim was a bit more firm.",4
113432,I LOVE these butterfly wings! They are lightweight and very comfortable. Super cute!

678071,First off I'd like to say that the sizing isn't all that accurate and if you are a medium US you are better off buying a large. I personally ordered mediums and returned the items and reordered bigger sizes that fit more appropriate. I would also like to say that the seller is awesome in terms of fixing their mistakes and keeping in contact. I would highly recommend that you buy these shirts if you like them. Their overall customer service is excellent and I appreciate them keeping in con tact through emails and such.,5
821602,Comfy but not sure what was up with the fabric.  I wore them for a summer and the butt tore along the pocket stitching.  I do not keep a lot in my pockets and all I can figure is the cloth was maybe over dyed which can make the cloth fragile,3

713392,"This shirt was perfect for my husband to wear for halloween, our daughter loved it on him. The fabric is good quality. The picture of olaf is also clear and god quality. The only thing was it was a bit big for a medium, but other than that its a great shirt.",4
69785,"Softens and moistens leather perfectly. I used it on my jacket and it is now suptle and soft.  Plus, it's made from the tears of vicious minks that would tear you apart with their needle-like teeth if they had the chance.  Don't give them that chance.  Protect the children and only use genuine mink oil on your leather goods.",5
175188,fit as described in measuring the shirt is so nice light weight but slinky the cross on front is made well not printed on actual studs but the studs don't poke through the other side like some annoying shirts. Washed it and it held its shape didn't loose any of the studs still very soft,5
495227,It looks just like the photo ! Its kinda got shine but not too shiny. It's kinda too big on me and I order small but that's because im skinny with a booty. But other than that it was really cute and sexy. I love it I made sure I wear jacket over it. But it's really cute!  Took about two weeks to get here! I hope my review help you out!,5
670539,"I'm usually wearing size S, after reading the reviews I ordered size L, I can fit in it but looks soo small, my bellybutton is showing, and u can see thru the shirt. It's nice material but I should order XL or even larger, so it would look like on the picture.
I'm 5'9, 135lbs.",1
413515,"This is the nicest winter jacket I have ever owned.  The zippers function well and there are many good pockets.  The liner makes for a nice light weight jacket and it zips in and out easily.  Very comfortable, and very warm.  We had a cold winter - some days of -4 with -15 windchills and many days around zero - jacket was great.  Also, easy to clean.  A design of jacket that seems like it was very well thought out.  I plan to buy the waist length of the same type.",5
452796,"Not true to size, should have ordered size larger, should have ordered a 9 instead of 7..  Too low on waist,  uncomfortable in female areas and butt, it basically was geared more for a younger girl, teenager maybe as sizes more for young girls, not misses sizes. I did love the length.  Would have given a 4 to 5 if fit properly.",3
47050,"These earmuffs are the best! I am a hat hater, they always make me way too hot. And any of the headband type earwarmers that are out there just give me headaches. I've tried the knit headbands and many others. These are perfect! No headaches and no hot head! I would very highly recommend them.",5
214773,"It fits perfectly, feels great and I've received several compliments while wearing it.
The only complaint is the pockets seem to be glued shut. I can tell there's stitching, but I couldn't open it up, as there appears to also be glue. I know they're not REALLY meant to be used, but I wanted to put a handkerchief in one pocket and can't.
I will be buying more of these, in different colors.",5
567570,FANTASTIC product. This pill box case is VERY well made and is super fun and cute. I wanted something discreet to carry in my purse and this just looks like a little make up bag! I'd recommend this to ANYONE looking for a great organizer that is discreet and darling.,5
87561,"This little dress is adorable, though extremely short. It is not, however, well made, and the material for the skirt seems cheap. Additionally, the hem fell out before I had even worn it, which is the only reason it was of sufficient length to qualify as a dress rather than an oddly constructed t-shirt.",3
355479,"The temples are so short that the tips barely touch my ears! The only reason these glasses don't fall off my face is that they're not wide enough for my head either, so they grip that way. After some use and the temples loosen up, these glasses will be unusable.",2
816197,"As a women in her 50's with curves, I wasn't too keen on going hiking through the rain forest to get to a river for tubing in my one piece. I paired this cute top with the Private Island rash guard skinny shorts (closer to capris) and now I am ready for fun! The top is nice and blousy so it gives everything nice coverage. At the price point you won't find anything better!",5
10310,"My son is only 10, but he has cool underwear.  Don't put your kids in underoos or tighty whiteys.  Boxer briefs are better, but the long legs on them are cumbersome.  These trunks are perfect.  They are a great fit, soft, stretchy and supportive.  Very comfortable and they look cool.",5
20786,"Ii play Baby Flap sun Protection Swim hat. Gray
Cute little hat that gives plenty of coverage. the only down side is that the front flap falls down in my grandson's eyes during swimming lessons. I prefer a bucket hat that he comes out out of the water and can see. Maybe if the front wasn't so long  & if it had velcro at the neck instead of ties it would be perfect. It is an attractive hat for a little guy depending what you are using it for.",4
574939,"I wear a 61/2 so I thought the medium would be big enough, but my toe is at the very end.  Would probably be uncomfortable for someone who wears a 7.  Will get the large if I order another pair.  As for softness and warmth they are wonderful!",5
292930,I got theses for my girl some time ago. At first they took a bit to get on her we discovered that easiest way to get them on here was to place the shield over her nipple and suck her nipple to pull it through. Vary fun and she looks AMAZING and they stay a long time with messing with them she wears them out all the time.,5
564712,I absolutely love Tumbl Wear! This is the 3rd leo I've bought from them and I am always so happy with the product. The material is nice and thick/durable and fits my daughter perfect. They wash well and are American made! Plus you get a cute note on the back of the tag each time. I'll never buy from another company again. We LOVE tumbl wear!,5
739190,"I just got my pair yesterday and first impression, they are really nice, especially for the price. They came with a soft case/bag and a hard shell case, and a repair tool to tighten up the screws. I had lost my Ray Bans and was seriously debating spending $150+ for a new pair, but as for now, I'm pretty pleased with this pair for 10% the cost of my Ray Bans.",5
312150,"I purchased a pair of these in sterling silver to wear with a pair of diamond earrings. The original white gold backs were always slipping and I was afraid I would lose an earring. I put these on immediately upon arrival and my earrings are secure and they fit the posts perfectly. Normally if I sleep in my earrings, I have to check the backs and make sure they are still in place in the morning. I did not have to adjust these backs after sleeping.",5
83215,"I love the lens but the frame does not fit my face. It cuts into the sides of my nose after a few minutes of wearing it. Also, it did not come with microfiber cloth as advertised. I have sent this back and ordered from HSN the original HD sunglasses which I have used and loved them.",2
546596,"I went by the chart that was available for my correct size and was pleased when it arrived, because it fit perfect. The material was more like a silky type that a thicker polyester, but I liked that even better. Colors were nice and bright and it took a little longer to arrive than what I had hoped for, however, it did state prior to  my ordering it that it would be a couple of weeks. Overall I was pleased.",5
791955,"I bought this for my daughter, who loves cats, for her birthday. I took it out of the plastic packaging just to examine the quality & it seems like it is a great quality purse, especially for my soon to be 8 year old. It's really nice & the chain seems very sturdy, even comes with a little pouch to hold the chain when not using. Love it.",5
113244,"Really pretty wings! I bought these to go with my Halloween costume! They were pretty comfortable, however after 8+ hours wearing wings you could start to feel the elastic around the shoulders.  The finger holes on the wings fell off after less than an hour, otherwise i would have probably given it 5 stars. I got tons of compliments wearing these!",4
47144,"I purchased two of these headbands.  One is missing but I like the ease and lightness of this visor.  While it is not a big fashion statement, it is much better constructed than the simple foam ones with only the top covered with glued on material.  This item  is fabric on both sides with a black cloth lining making it look good.",5
339438,Good for a child 6 to 10 or so. One hat worked perfectly and the other one worked for about 5 minutes then the lights went out. Thought it might be the batteries so I changed them but still didn't work. Sadly these are being returned l. My boys really loved them.,3
713885,"these fit as expected. They are very soft and comfortable. I hate boxers and usually go with boxer briefs, but lately I've been liking underwear like this.. a little bit more fashion. I have purchased and will definitely purchase more. I did receive these at a slight discount from retail for an honest review. My suggestion would be to order one pair first to get your sizing right as the sizing might be different.",5
684005,"This item seems very large for the size that I ordered, which is rare being that I am curvy. It's not usual for a medium to fit so loose. It looks like a mechanics uniform on me. There's just way to much excess material. I feel like I should be working on someone's vehicle when I put this on.",2
722763,"Long wait, but not a lot of choice of vendors, but still arrived a lot earlier than the projected latest date..  All cotton but seemingly durable.  The front pockets both a had a section that was sewn shut during the course of sewing some other seam.  One opened up with the force of my hand, the other I had to cut.  As long as nothing else comes unstitched over time, I saw no reason to remove a start.",5
774575,"I have gotten a lot of compliments on this sweater.  It is not a dress by any means, but more like a long sweater you wear with leggings.  I am an X Large and I ordered a 2X and it fit just the way I wanted it to.  I have ordered other items in my size and they are too small.  I am learning that you need to go larger in size when ordering.  The pockets are more like folds in the material, but they come across as pockets.  I would recommend this sweater.",5
876113,"I am obsessed with Duduma sunglasses! This was my second pair and I loved the color and the fit! They are not as dark/tinted as some of the other sunglasses I own, but not to the extent that they weren't effective. I bought these in the pink color and they are very mirrored which was exactly the look I was going for. You also can't beat the price!",5
434048,"Made my feller look sleek, svelt, and dapper. Although, the facial mask part he kept off most of the evening because he couldn't see through it, and felt like he couldn't breathe. The zipper was a pain to get over his hair - recommend a bandana or something to aid in that process. Still, it was a great costume and he is eager to wear it again. We'll just have to figure something out about how to see better. Was probably because his eyes didn't match up with the eye sockets on the mask.",5
43645,My 3 year old granddaughter loved hers! Along with her rain boots it's fun to go walking in the rain & jump the puddles. Love that you can  see her through it as she wanders ahead. Also like the dome shape so I don't get jabbed accidentally with the spokes. These spokes turn  down rather than out.,5
619931,"Came earlier than expected. Beautiful! Decent quality for the price. My foots a little wider by the toes, so I had to really work my door in to the bottom part, but by the end of the night the shoes had stretched and were comfortable. The heel part is VERY narrow so walking on uneven ground is tricky, had a little trouble with the zipper getting stuck.
I LOVE these shoes!",4
34689,"I had bought this for my mom because her purse was ruined. She loves it and now carries it everytime she goes out or have an appointment. It is a nice size Purse and fits all her things in it. Such as:books,cell phone and other items. Bag is made of nice leather and with a adjustable strap.",5
167568,"These are awesome yoga capris.  I kinda stepped out on a limb as I don't like to buy clothes online without being able to touch and feel the fabric, see the stitching, make sure they fit... but with these I scored on all accounts! The fit is amazing, and they are quality made.  I received these at a discount in exchange for an honest review and I'm so glad that I did.  They are my all time favorite yoga pants and I want them in every color now!!",5

Review of Bag King:  ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!  I paid for the bag at 3pm on a weekday, the 12 noon the NEXT DAY the mailman was delivering the item to my door.  I literally had to go back and check the invoice to be sure I wasn't mistaken as to when I had purchased the bag.  AAAAAAAA++++++++",5
148771,I needed more nursing clothes after the arrival of my baby. I bought the pink flowery one and wore it home from the hospital. It fit my belly which was still big after giving birth. Now I wear it around the house and to sleep. I'm wearing it as I type with the sleeves/top pulled down to air out the nips. Its easy enough to pull the sleeves back on when visitors come over. I think it's so comfortable I bought a second one in blue.,5
643045,"I ordered a brown one and a black one, and they are terrific. Perhaps as good as the ones on Amazon (and widely advertised) for 2ce as much money. I purposely ordered mine a bit long and lopped off 4"". Better too long than too short. Additionally an unexpected benefit came about. Once you insert the belt in the buckle it pops out the other side and automagically threads itself into the first loop on my pants! :)",5
64279,"Material is SUPER stiff and scratchy for my 22 month old's skin.  After a couple days of wear (we washed according to instructions before wear), he developed a severe red rash on his bottom where you pull up and down the underwear.  Seems like the best way to go is to purchase simple solid colored toddler underwear, instead of the popular character choices, which are often stiff and uncomfortable.",2
105167,"i followed the measurement chart and my top is perfect. i am 5'5. bust 37"". the top looks just like photo. just so elegant. i intend to wear nice fitted grey or slate slacks and almond top pumps with this. maybe a long soft pearl necklace to boot. i'm happy with my purchase.",5

63107,"I bought a turquoise necklace from this seller earlier, and liked it so much, that decided to get a coral one too. It's a beautiful necklace, definitely looks more expensive than what I paid for it. The color is nice deep, warm red. The necklace is pretty wide, and is shaped to hug your neck in a nice way. It looks very much like on the picture, I certainly wasn't disappointed. Beautiful piece of jewelry! Highly recommended!",5
157118,"I was excited to see a review from a woman taller and heavier than me had purchased these and they had fit, so I purchased them. I have a large booty and was disappointed to find that I can't get them over my bum. They are right and uncomfortable on the rest of my body, anyways.",2
758927,Although the dress is beautiful the fit was very small.  We provided measurements to be customized. Skirt is not as full as picture.  Can not wear a petticoat or hoop skirt as the skirt was too short.  Skirt is a little different from the listing picture. Dress fits about 2 sizes too small.,3
483193,Bought these for wife at  Christmas after a hint. She had ordered some previously after seeing them on a TV  infomercial and loved the way they fit. Only problem it took forever for them to arrive. I was relieved to find them on Amazon. Although not Prime they still arrived fairly quickly. She says they are the most comfortable bra she has ever worn and highly recommends them.,5
501666,"Ordered this for my sister and normally she is a medium, but because of the reviews I decided to order her a large. However, that being said, the large was still not big enough for her which is surprising because of how petite she is generally in size and stature. Most likely will be returning because it still doesn't fit.",3
438918,"The coat itself is stylish. It smelled kind of funny coming out of the package, though. That wasn't really my beef with it. I ordered a men's XXL for my husband, who is a M in American sizes. He could barely get both arms in it. Only order these coats if you are a very small person, and then order as if you were a giant.",2
573795,"I haven't worn or washed it yet, but it feels and looks great!  I found it to run true to size, despite varying reviews from others.  I absolutely love white cotton gowns, and have been disappointed since Victoria's Secrets stopped carrying them.  These are very reasonably priced, good quality, attractive packaging.",5
149812,"I think with good care it will fit my baby for a couple of years. Bought this for my 4 month old. It's spring now, so she won't use it til Winter comes. But I tried it on my 4 year old and it fits him as well. I like it.",4
1542,"I find myself just loving these hats,  I've  written quite a few reviews of many Henschels that I have.  For me, they are well worth it; comfort, style, practical, and well made.  All you have to do is try one or two or three!!!  CoolMax band is unique and adds to comfort, I am from Louisiana, and there is no shortness of heat and humidity here.",5
386883,"It doesn't completely cover my rear as it does on the model, but I'm 5'9"" so perhaps that's to be expected. It covers less than half. I got a medium, and I generally wear a medium IRL, and this fits fine. If you want a longer fit I'd go up a size.",5
329800,"Love these sun glasses, I always get compliments on them when I wear them. But they are very fragile, one of the glass in the frame slighty popped out after only a wear or two so I had to pop them back in place. Other than the quality they are a nice pair to have to leave an impression or if you don't care much for breaking them.",4
400284,"I was quite impressed when these arrived and wrote a review which was never posted...so I'll try again. The topaz earrings arrived almost immediately, well packaged and then additionally housed in a lovely lavender presentation box. Even more surprising than the perfectly matched gorgeous deep London blue color of the stones, was the fairly heavy weight of the silver. They will make a stunning gift.",5
40517,"These seem to come untied more frequently than other shoe laces. Maybe it's due to the metal tips being heavier, I'm not sure. Also the metal tips make noises when they tap the ground as you walk but mine might just be too long for me. So I stopped using them. I do love the color though.",2
55264,"My son got a fractured nose during basketball. No one sells them locally, so we ordered one. He missed one game but it did arrive sooner than expected, fit was fine, and was easy to clean. He didn't like it because he said it was difficult to look down without moving his head, but at ,east he was able to play.",4
601332,"I used this for a fursuit head, actually. It's the perfect size!

If you don't know what a fursuit is, still keep reading.

The quality is really sturdy for a cheap novelty gift, but take note, the lense color is not accurate to the photo. It's not clear, nor is it 'sunglasses.' It's somewhere in between like a light grey tint.",5
6321,"Every time I buy a pair of Carhartt carpenter pants they turn out to be a slightly different material and a slightly different color and different pocket configurations.  I wish I could get a pair like the first ones I had, they even had a little tab to hang a tape measure on.  These are okay, just not quite the same.",3
210002,"Excellent quality for the price.  The band does not pull hair, as another reviewer has suggested. It fit's a 22mm opening perfectly and comes with the spring pins as well as a pin removal tool. You really couldn't ask for more at this price.  Buy it, you won't be disappointed.",5
845714,"Other reviews are correct. The dress slit will ride up HIGH on you. I fixed that problem by picking the perfect spot where I don't want the slit to go any higher and sewed it really quickly with a few stitches. Problem solved.

Other than that, it is a cheap and is a comfortable dress to wear.",4
803812,Highly recommend!! Very absorbent! My little guy can wear one the entire day & he never gets wet underneath. The snaps hold firm & the fabric is thick & great quality. I've washed them several times already & they're holding up very well. The grey colors also go with just about everything.  I'm so very pleased with this purchase!!,5
674167,Ordered this dress for prom. It looks awesome.  I was a bit nervous about ordering a dress online without trying it on.  Wow! I am so impressed. It is fabulous. It's very full. No need for a slip.  It said that I would receive the dress in mid January.  I got it in just 3 weeks of ordering it. Very fast delivery. I will definitely order more dresses from this company.,5
832595,"This is a well made dress, but I had to return it.  I usually take a medium or large size in dresses.  The fit was just right, but the front was way too short.  If the length in the front had been about 3"" longer, it would have been perfect. I also loved the color.",5
80236,"Fits perfectly I got a medium and I am 5'4"" and I weigh 160 lbs (I do not have a lot of chub at all I am mostly muscle) I have size 36 c  the thing fits perfectly as well! This product is awesome and yes it is stretchy so if you have wider hips or bigger boobs you will just flaunt more !(:",5
630835,I purchased a large at first and had a problem-free experience exchanging for a smaller size. The large was so big that I ended up changing to a small which was perfect. I am 5'5 normally 135lbs and usually wear a medium in all tops. I didn't take into account that this was a maternity t-shirt which makes sense why the large was ridiculously big but I am surprised at how much room I still had at 18-20 weeks pregnant with twins while wearing a small. Loved it for Halloween!,5
342733,This purse is great. It's just the right size for me. It also has two pockets inside and a zippered pocket on the back. The lining is nice and the stitching is good. This bag won't fall apart after a couple of uses. I get a lot of compliments about this purse. I might order another one in a different color! ,5
443412,"I love these boots, they are stylish, durable, dressy, yet casual, go great with jeans, or skirts, excellent no slip soles.  I like to wear them with leggings tucked in and a nice long length pull over sweater.  I get many complements on how nice they look, especially tucked into jeans.  They are very comfortable, and no slip grip sole is well made.",5
158870,"I love this pants!  I bought a small in light green and coral, both great!  I purchased a 2nd pair and thinking of going for a 3rd.  I'm 5'8 and they are really long (good in my case) and a bit big in the waist (130 lbs) but I'm completely ok with that. So comfy, so cute.",5
65764,"Omg! I love them. So many for such an awesome  price! All kinds of different barbells with Huge variety. there are so many different colors and designs. Typical price for these run about  $14.99 for 4 at hot topic. So far through digging, I have found skulls, pot leaves, hearts, spirals, tippy designs, and really bright neons. All of these for under what I usually pay for 4. I am incredibly happy with this deal andy friends will be too as there are enough to share!",5
187702,"I adore this skirt but it's quite short... if I have my arms at normal length to my sides, my fingers go past the length of the skirt. I wouldn't recommend buying this skirt if you are over 5'5 (my height) or weigh over 125, because it simply won't fit quite right.",5
609122,"It's ok for the price (I paid $14ish), it's not as soft and it's a little thicker than I'd like, and very short but as expected by the pic. It also didn't come with one of the hooks for the ""belt"". It's ok for what I need it for (hospital for birth) but since it's quite stiff, I wouldn't purchase another one. Maybe with more use/washes it'll be better, if so, I'll update this review.",3
83586,"However the rubber cusions on the earpieces tend to slip off after short use. The lenses will pop out if the glasses fall, they can be put back in, but it's a pain. Once the lenses have popped out they never seem to stay in well afterwards.
The glasses last much longer than the ""Seen on TV HD glasses, pretty much the same HD color and clarity.",4

I don't like the material, it has a very synthetic feels to it, does not feel very good against your skin.  I gave it away.",2
454150,"The fabric on this onesie is nice and lightweight, perfect for summer but could also be paired with pants for the colder months. I have washed this quite a lot and its held up thru everything my 5 month old has put it thru. I will say it does run just slightly small in my opinion. We love it!",5
80015,I wanted to purchase them for me toddler she has a lot of pink outfits but when I got them  it's nothing like the picture I got more yellow and orange color socks.....I wasn't happy with that at all. The only good thing it's that they fit her well.,2
405455,"I bought this to go with the fairy pink wings for my daughter's 4th birthday party.  I was pretty impressed, it was a good price and very detailed, it wasn't cheap looking or poorly made.  Now, my 18 month old daughter got a hold of it and beat it on everything she could find and the stick eventually came apart from the butterfly (but I can't really rate it poorly, it took quite a beating).  The butterfly is still very much intact and we repurposed it now as a darling little wall decoration in her room.",5

I got the large and I'm 5'8"" 170lbs and fits a bit large but after a few washes it should be perfect!! The XL is for 6 feet plus imo.  Very happy with my purchase and the sellers were great as well! Everything came in Versace packaging and looked gorgeous! Thx again-",5
325120,"Keeps everything simple and light.  If you need to carry a lot in your wallet it's not for you, but if you down size it's perfect.  I've had this wallet for awhile now and it works for me so well that I ordered 2 more to give as gifts.",5
813161,"This dress just didn't look right on anyone that tried it.  It looks fine on the model in the product listing, but it was cut strange under the arms to work with the straps.  I started a return and then forgot about it so I just donated it to a thrift store.",2
466456,"This is a thick, heavy sweater that feels very cozy to wear. Its texture leans more towards the coarse side, but still feels soft, It is also very comfortable and warm, and the soft brown coloring is perfect and goes nicely with other neutral colors. It makes for a fantastic throw on in cooler weather and washes easily.",5
87059,"As expected from the photo, this top is a bit roomy being an XS. With that said, it is a cute top with the bow attached. I like the ruffle detailing and it's not overly done. It does need a little ironing but what Allegra K product doesn't. Great when paired and tucked in with just about anything. When purchasing, keep in mind it does run large so its expected to be a little roomy which only adds comfort but doesn't compromise on style.",4
572312,"When this scarf arrived, it was frayed & falling apart at the seams, and had to be returned. I would much rather have just exchanged it because I do love it. It's just broken and falling apart. (Packaging was completely undamaged. I noticed the damage to the scarf after removing and unfolding it.)",1

Disappointly the medium size I picked was too big even though it was listed as 7..It would be nice if the manufacturer would review the hat sizes as the sizes listed are misleading. Worst still, I couldn't return the hat as it would have cost too much to return as my uncle resides in a different country where I already sent hat as I live in the US.Long story short.....another unwanted item.",2

If you want to talk about convenience, user friendly, and a product that eases frustration, then this is the product to talk about. The other morning, after spending about 3-5 minutes, I grew increasingly frustrated trying to button my shirt. I then remembered that I had this tool and viola... shirt was buttoned and I was ready to go. I love this. I even used it as a collar stay. Great product. I will be purchasing these for my friends.",5
70726,"We were looking for the His/Hers matching titanium wedding bands but could not find any we liked in the stores. We ordered this set just a couple of days before the wedding. It was risky, but we got them and are very happy with our choice. I get a lots of complements on the rings.",5
17771,"I get many compliments on this ring.  It really is pretty without.being too flashy.  I wear it at times as an eternity band and at other times as a wedding band to leave my expensive set at home.  I've had this ring for a little over a month now, and in no way have I taken the extra care to take it off for dish washing. Or cleaning.  It is still all in one piece with no stones lost thus far.  It's a great value for the money and runs true to size.",5
50179,A versatile pair of shoes great for the boat and also casual trips around town.  I've bought many pairs of Sperry's in the past and so was confident in the size I needed.  I like to buy my Sperry's a little snug and they quickly stretch to fit my feet.  This color is one of my favorites and I find myself wearing them often.,5
468852,"Exactly what I expected from a company that has outfitted our troops for a century.  The boots are comfy right out of the box, and the ""sharkskin"" overlays on the toe and heel look like they will offer extra protection.
As with any footwear, fit is everything.  I will try formfitting bedliners over the ones that came withthe boots.
Haven't worn them in wet conditions so I don't how the waterproofing performs.",4
71108,"My baby was baptized at 2.5 months and he was 11 lbs and 22 inches long. I went with the month suggestion rather than pound suggestion as 6-8 lbs is TOTALLY inaccurate. Even with that, the outfit was still quite large on him. I imagine it would still fit if he was 26 inches and 15 lbs.

The great thing is, if you pick the wrong size, you can send it back with free shipping.

I did not use the hat, but the outfit is great quality, lightweight enough for the summer heat and comfortable material for the baby.",4
578369,"The product arrived quickly. The tights are baggy on me and i'm average size. 5'5"" and 130#. When I put them on the first time I discovered a run over the left knee. Since I had just put them on fresh out of the package I don't think it was anything I did. I wear them to keep my legs and feet warm at night with a niteshirt so how they look isn't important but if i had ordered them to wear as tights I would be upset.",2
829022,"Slip is the key word here. Not dress. The material is very soft and silky, and THIN. The length is really short, and if you are curvy of course you know your curves will eat up most of the length. I decided that my slip is now a shirt to wear under other shirts. It's cute, and depending on your level of modesty it could be a slip, or dress. I think it's multifunctional.",3
586287,It arrived pretty timely and looks really nice for the price! Ive been wearing it for a few months and it hasn't broken and no gems have fallen out. I originally put it in a newer piercing and it got a little irritated so I waited awhile before putting it back in and I've had no problems since,5
382553,"Definitely order a size up from what you usually wear. I'm 5'3, curvy, 36C and I got an xlarge. Very cute. It's really short but it'll still cover your butt, but I would definitely wear shorts underneath or leggings. Thin material, almost like a t-shirt. I would still recommend though just because it looks nice",5
132995,The stones are exactly as advertised.  The size is what I expected based on the description and the diamonds sparkles.  They are very clear and brilliant.  This is my second set of diamond earrings from this company and both pairs are of excellent color and brilliance.  The diamonds come with authentication certificates.,5
683926,"I really like this piece, but the sleeves are ridiculously too long! The pattern is really pretty and the length is longer, which is what I wanted. I contacted the company and they offered to give me back half my money. I thought that was a really good deal so I kept the piece and will have the sleeves hemmed. Once hemmed, this will look great with jeans.",4
316371,"This is the 2nd pair of these that I have bought (lost the first pair). Yes, they're thick and bulky so it's difficult to do much in them, but I live in Chicago, so I'm picky about one thing: warmth. I have about 15 pairs of gloves (some very expensive, some very stylish, some both)  but I wear these every day. These are soooo warm and soft. That's it. Very warm and very soft inside, which is what I assume people are looking for in a glove like this.",5
553582,"These are *very* thin long johns with essentially no support in the crotch.  I suppose the lack of support makes my junk look bigger, but it's weird to have it just flying around like that.  Very little insulation due to the thin, silky material, but it feels good, except for the strangely placed seam in back that rides up your butt crack.  Hard to get used to that...",3
199341,It's cute but much bigger than I expected. The bottom part of the ring covers the entire belly button. And the top part that screws on is about the size of the normal bottom jewel. It's not subtle. Looks like a piece of glamour bling. Not bad if that's what you want. But I wanted something more simple to have in when running or spinning.,4
86544,"The dress does not look like the picture at all. It is made with a very thin material and you can see through. I am not returning it because I bought it for my daughter to wear as a costume in a school play, otherwise I would not have kept it. Do not buy it!!!",2
361422,"These boots are awesome! Though they feel slightly snug on my wide feet when I put them on, they don't rub anywhere and are comfortable all day. I am not good with heels, and I love how these look like more heel than they feel like. The sole is very sturdy and I feel very stable in them. I got the black suede and they are super cute. Terrific with a dress and leggings or a pair of ankle jeans.",5
760719,"This dress is really comfortable. The fabric is nice and it fit as expected. The size charts are an excellent guide to help you choose your size. It is not too short. It can be worn well with or without tights. If they had more colors, I would buy them all.",5
607937,"Great for work or family events where silicon tunnels are frowned upon. Don't use alcohol to clean, it strips the coating over the peal part, soap and water will clean them just as well. Not really great for wearing while swimming, showering or bathing, the tunnel and pearl bulb are hollow and will hold water. Other than that I love the girly and feminine look and feel of the gauges.",4
645359,"so disappointed in this. the back would look great if it wasn't super deformed and wrong- fitting. I am 92 pounds and got a small- it should have fit perfectly. the bottoms fit ""ok""- a little cheeky, but I don't mind that. the top looked horrible on and was made so awkwardly. now I have to find a different swimsuit for summer :(",2
298025,"You will not find a better boho sundress at this price! I'm 5'6"", 137lbs and ordered a Medium. It fits great. The straps are adjustable so you can play with the length a little. I ordered the same dress in both blue and black. I'm so excited to wear this on my Hawaii vacation! Other reviews detail that the dress comes very wrinkled. This is true, but nothing an iron can't fix.

Edit: I washed this dress once (no dryer) and it shrunk. I would recommend hand washing it.",5
25983,"I have maybe 3 pairs of these in different shoes. I have flat feet and if I'm on them without them in my shoes, I end up with arch pain and develop posterior tibialis tendonitis. I keep them in my running shoes and hiking boots and have no problems with a break in period.",5
823394,"Comfortable lounge pants.  Great for this springtime weather.  Appear to be well made and durable.  They are not paper thin fabric.  I have a 34 inch waste and there is plenty of room to spare.

I received these at a discount in exchange for a fair and honest review.",4
54009,"This hat was a perfect buy! The strings helped my son fail at escaping. And it truly does block the sun. My son has extremely fair skin, little hair, with a rather large head, and this hat is perfect for all sizes. You can adjust the circumference if baby's head is smaller! Great buy!",5
29201,"The pair that have the printed fabric are not soft at all and are much smaller than the non-printed pair.  I would need the next larger size for the printed pair to fit me.  I ordered large size (as usual for me) and I have a 38 or 39"" waist, depending on whether we had pizza the night before or not.",2
390781,"I am 5'5"", weigh 145 pounds and this dress fit like I expected.  I ordered a medium.  The dress is comfortable and cute.  It did come with a small stain on the skirt part but with the pattern it doesn't stand out enough to hassle with a return.",4
588884,I love my peeper-keepers and own several pairs in various colors.  I really like the quality beading.  They are lovely and I can coordinate with what I am wearing.  The rubber grips stay put on the eyeglass frames and do not slip.  Would recommend this product and I will continue to purchase more colors as needed.,5
84491,"The top i got looks like picture the material is heavy but nice. I ordered two sizes too big trying to shrink it washed in washer and dried in dryer no problems with material, it has not shrunk. It's huge so i won't wear this in public nice to wear around the house super long.  Item arrived in October happy with purchase.",4
121762,"Just got my lifter today and it looks great , shipping was fast I ordered Oct. 12 and got it on the 15 . It fits perfect I went one size up (med to a large) & I was completely shocked when I put it on , this product is amazing and the price is a plus . I'm thicker than honey now ",5
242991,"This ring looks just like it does in the photo. Many of the tungsten rings I saw were a slightly darker metal, a bit more gray. This ring has the polished color of white gold. It shipped quickly and looks just like other rings I saw for a much higher price. I am very satisfied with this purchase!",5
304155,I bought these to wear during childbirth and thereafter to help heal (since I did not breastfeed). These bras are great because the zipper is located in the front and the inner padding can be removed. The colors are very nice and they wash well. I would have given them 5 stars but didn't because they fit pretty tight. I tried to get the size for me by guestimating (estimated by guessing) and bought the medium size (I'm a 34B in regular bra). Last time I checked sizing guide from the makers was non-existent.,4
294143,"Keeping only due to being to cheep in price to return.  Color right on, size a bit smaller than expected, and the smell, AWEFUL, HORRIBLE, smelled like petroleum product. Had to wash my hands twice with lots of soap to get the smell off.  Hoping washing removes the smell or they will end up in the trash.",1
203543,"This is a beautiful dress - fits a variety of sizes without being too loose or too tight under the arms - PLUS the belt is not attached, so it will lay wherever you want it to and you're not stuck with a belt that is too high or too low !",5
121371,"I love the look, but it is hard to clasp closed, and the glass topped bird pic, though I love, seems to make it heavy and always wants to turn to the underside of my wrist. The ring that held the chain for closing also came apart....twice....probably from me pulling it to try and clasp. I wasn't tight, it was just heavy and awkward.",3
767014,"Great glasses, received them in perfect condition, not a scratch, didn't have to adjust anything to fit them right, great for driving, not too dark, and with the bifocal glass at the bottom, it makes it easy to read the radio..., when you want to see things in detail, if you need reading glasses, all you need to do is tilt your head back just a little to see everything clearly. Will buy one more pair for my other car. Great for outdoors too, can check your phone..., without having to switch to reading glasses all the time.",5
867182,I was hoping the size was what I needed and it is perfect. I love all the pockets so I don't waste time searching for items. the strap extends really far so it is great for wearing cross body. The waterproof material is just a bonus. Great color as well (I got purple). Highly recommend!,5
435431,"Received the 12/13 size as a gift. As a woman with size 11w feet, I was concerned that they wouldn't be wide enough to fit comfortably. However, I was quite pleased when I put them on and they fit perfectly. Great for any Jack fan!

Word of caution: Do not wear these when walking up or down stairs and be careful on smooth surfaces, sliding may occur!",5
469856,I AM NOT ABLE TO RATE THIS DRESS AS YET BECAUSE I AM STILL WAITING ON IT.  I WAS HEADING TO JAMAICA AND WANTED MY DRESS TO SHOW OFF AND WEAR AND IS STILL WAITING.  JUST DISAPPOINTED ABOUT THAT ORDER AND SORRY I DID.  MY RATING IS NOT ACCURATE BECAUSE I STILL HAVE NOT SEEN IT YET.,1
857755,"The design on the shirt is embroidered on and the ringing on the top and bottom is nice. Good quality item and my daughter LOVES the design.

Update: I took it to 4 stars from 5 because I noticed that the print on the shorts is upside down. My daughter doesn't mind though, since they look right side up to her.

I did not experience the fading issue described by some reviewers. We have washed them twice now and have not seen any significant fading. We bought the size 7 in Feb 2017.",4
212916,"Very good price. Good quality. I keep a few dollar bills, three or four credit cards, and so forth in it so as not to have to tote a fat wallet around. Previously I used a wallet type of enclosure for my cell phone, and when the sort I wanted was no longer available, I turned to a light traditional wallet. The Hammer Anvil does the job well.",5
407197,"there were some complaints. first, it took some time for it to be shipped out (4 days).  i had it shipped expedited 2-3days and it took 6 days to get to my house.  second, its cheaper on the website (10% off).  third, three of the diamonds were really dull and under size compared to the other ones.  the necklace wasn't as sparkling as the photo showed.",2
70554,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it, it is made well and a looks wonderful on the wrist. If I had one negative it is a little difficult getting it on and getting it tight enough for small wrists. I would definitely recommend the product.",5
394654,"This is the favorite of all my Amazon dress purchases. My cat agrees that it's very flattering. I wasn't sure, given its body forming fit, whether this would be a work appropriate outfit or not. I've decided I'm going to wear it anyway and see how that goes! It's just too cute not to.",5
502278,"I get a lot of compliments on this dress. It took a long time to arrive and had a small hole in the seam after 1 wear, but it was able to be sewn easily and I still wear it regularly. I love the color block and the material is comfortable, not too thin.",4
582280,"Well I didn't receive my Gold cuffs, though I recived a gold bendable belt, I was so happy it was just in time for my Birthday, the sleeves were tight to slip on and off, I think U need to go up a size, but everyone loved it as well.",5
821305,"I love this purse!! It's punky enough for my style and the design has yet to fade since I've bought it almost a year ago. It's been through travel, thrown around in the vehicle with my son and easy to clean. It's nice to know I can have a nice thing!",5
87638,"The label says ""dress with belt"", but no belt. I guess it's a hit or miss w/ the belt.  The top is see through, that was unexpected...I'm 5'1 so I can wear it as a summer dress, or pair it with leggings if you think it's too short.  You need to iron the bow, looks like it's dying, ha!",4
791903,"These shorts fit fine around the waist, but shorter than measured and expected! I have the same shorts but with a 2"" shorter inseam, and when I got these, they ride just as high as the others. I was expecting the 2 inches lower on my legs. But, great material!",3
95227,"This shirt looked great on, but I wore it too my desk job and that's when I noticed how small it was because it started to give me a back ache throughout the day. I'm 5'6 and about 140lbs with a chest size of 34C, I ALWAYS buy a medium, but this is just a little too small probably due to the unforgiving material. I won't return it bc it's a great looking design and it's fine when I'm standing and moving around, but I wish I would've known to get a large. Best Regards!",3
491041,I recently nought a few garments from this seller. This one is stellar quality for the price. The other one doesn't fit the measurements at all. This one is very well made. It's practical and adorable. Highly recommend... As for must Asian sellers. Always check check check your measurements and email them to double check theirs. It always runs small or something doesn't add up. So as a precaution do it. I'm thrilled to wear this coat.,5
548563,i love this jacket it was exactly how i expected it to be and more it fits perfect. the only bad thing about this is that the sleeves are short but i was told that was how the style was of the jacket. other than that i love this item and i will  be looking forward for something like this again.,5
84075,"Handy business card holder!  I toss this in with my million other things and know that my cards will remain crisp and professional. The card holder is beautiful, I picked blue leather with stainless; it has a nice heavy weight and I like that it opens on the vertical. I would recommend.",5
52373,"This product was better than I expected. Very cute, it has the strings for under the chin and a draw string at the back to tighten to the childs head so it stays in place. I got the light pink color and its very cute. Very happy with the product. I saw a few comments complaining the edges are floppy but that's what the product is, its a floppy sun hat. It does not impede on my daughtets agility to see and looks adorable.",5
611234,"The size was good. The color is more of a neon yellow than green and the bottom is see through on the backside, so I kept it 'cause I liked the top, but wear a different bottom from the one it came from. Sadly still not the green I expected.",2
851496,"I have never rated any product less than a 4 stars before (I usually don't rate it if the product isn't in my favor), because I understand that it is not easy to have a small business. But this Tank Top  is the worst product I have ever purchased online or in store! Worst Ever!
The tank top is very thin and cheap looking!",1
842838,"This scarf is huge!! Very light and sheer. Could be used for a dress up night out. Not for keeping you warm tho. The black seems to be a little light, or maybe a tinge of Brown mixed in. Not sure, but could be a blacker black. Is it silk? I guess so, but seems more like another fabric to me. However, keep in mind I'm no silk expert. It is very pretty and I'll use it often. It has quality stitching and came well packaged.",4
470804,"I bought this belt a few years ago to go with my Queen of Hearts costume and it has yet to fail me. It's spandex, so it's stretchy, and all the materials have held up through several years of costumes. It measures 2.5"" X 22.5"", but can stretch to about 1.5 times its length. Also, it's a bit brighter red than the picture shows and the clasp has more of a pewter look to it. Definitely worth the $8 I paid.",5
117925,"Fits as expected.  I am not certain if there is a 'proper' way to wear it, but i quickly learned that hiking it up higher than I wear trousers made the experience a bit more comfortable.  This has become my standard at-home wear, but I have never been one to wear anything but full-length trousers out of the house.  very comfortable, and looking forward to ordering another kilt in the near future.",5
772480,This dress is well-made and feels great on. I was expecting the waist to be at a normal height but it was actually an empire waist. I'm returning it because empire waists are just not flattering on me but on someone with a different body type this dress would be fabulous. It flows nicely and hangs well even though it is lightweight. A few different ways it could be worn depending on what you wear underneath (if anything) and whether you pair it with a belt or not.,4
402361,We did not like the watch when it arrived. The strap is cheap quality. We sent a mail to Watch Values (using the link provided in Amazon.com - there was no telephone number provided) asking to what address we should return the watch. Never received a reply. We then contacted Amazon customer service and got it resolved.,2
650605,"If I could give this zero stars I would.  Shame on these Chinese sellers taking pictures from other websites of beautiful dresses and then falsly selling us this crap.  The dress arrived not looking anything like the picture, it only came to the ankles, was completely see through and the slip underneath only covered up to my upper, upper thigh.  What a waste of money.  STAY AWAY from this product!!!!",1
727531,"For those who don't know, this is not a leather jacket, it is made all from cloth.  So long as you like that then this is the best you can find. It is very well done.  (I would have liked to have gotten a leather one.  That is why i only gave it 3 stars.)",3
646907,"""The Mountain"" makes damn fine shirts. In fact, in the last TWO years, the ONLY T-shirts I've bought are from ""The Mountain"". They fit perfectly. They don't shrink. The cotton material is just the exact weight and feel. They make perfect shirts.

This MInotaur shirt is killer. At first, I got it, not sure if I would like it, but the printing is beautiful. Like many other shirts from the Mountain, it has quickly become one of my favorite shirts.",5
153548,"Some of the cats don't actually look like cats... like, I'd say about 30% of the shapes on the scarf look like a cat. Some look like pterodactyls, giraffe, a horse, and someone who's fallen and can't get up reaching out their hand. That being said, it's not like anyone looks at it too closely, and it's way cheaper than many of its counterparts. Proceed with caution!",3
629266,"I did not like the look of it with the head band,it was too flat (netting) and it looked like it was ready to take off . I cut head band off and glued a clip in it to make it fit better. I love the shiny feathers, and I have the Perfect outfit to wear it with.",4
144230,This was perfect and really comfortable.  The material is stretchy for a comfortable fitted look.  I want to pick up more!  FYI the vest is NOT detachable but you can unbutton the vest and have it open to expose the shirt also it doesn't have a back so you will ses just the white shirt.,5
254415,"Second Snare purchase. This one fit just like the other. I wear a size 8 and I purchased a size 8. My only complaint is the color of the Taupe is a bit darker than I was expecting. But I will keep them because they're comfortable as always and I got them at a good price.
The heels click on hard floors, fyi. I don't mind it though.",4
620163,"Super cute for a rave themed party! I was a little worried because there was no sizing provided when I ordered, but it fit just fine. I wear a 34C bra and am 5', 110 lbs. A little complicated to figure out how to put it on at first though as there were no instructions included.",5
438436,The belt looks great from the outside. The buckle is beautiful and shines!! The other side of the belt is cheaply made. And the best fits really small...meaning I first ordered a size small and that was too small for me and I am 5'4 and weigh 113 pounds and my waist is probably a 27. So I ended up having to send back the small and order a medium a belt. The medium is better however even it ...could be longer.,3
482760,"My husband loves this belt.  I would buy him a belt every year for Christmas.  He never talked about a belt so much as he did this one.  He has had it a full year, and it is still in good shape.

I could not wait to wash it, so I could wear it again.  I wish they had purple and red available in my size right now.  I like that it doesn't have adjustable straps that would bother me, and it is really feminine.",5

We'll buy more as she grows and seasons change. Great product, great price.",5
108269,"I got five of these; I will probably get more - they are gorgeous and I have so many charms that are showcased beautifully on this chain.  It's not so plain that it looks cheap, and not so flashy that it takes away from the charms, just right.  Sturdy clasp.  Really good value.",5
474613,"The shipping was wonderful, I received my package promptly. The problem I have is that the diamonds are much smaller than I expected. It looks more like little tiny pieces of a mirror stuck into little grooves on the star. The back side of the star is also very disappointing, instead of being a smooth coat of gold it simply reveals the settings of the diamonds which is very unattractive. I would not recommend this product,and would purchase a solid gold necklace instead.",2

754592,"LOVE, LOVE LOVE these earrings! They are my daily go-to! They look wonderful next to my curly hair! They are of a good quality and are very wearable. The shape reflects light outside and the shape causes movement making the earring appear more interesting without being ostentatious. Would definitely recommend!!",5
581327,I love the first one I purchased. I have been using it well over a year. It has held up really well. I have it attached to my car keys and it gets tossed all over. I bought a second one and haven't liked it as much. The ends of the elastic strap petrude to far inside the middle pocket so it interferes with the cards. Would that be a one time defect and others would be like my first one that had no issues??,4
353563,When I first received the shoelaces one was half the tickets of the other. After a review was stated  explaining the problem the company immediately sent me another pair of the same thickness  leather laces.  They handled this error  with no problem. A real stand up company. Will reccomend them highly. Everyone makes mistakes. It is how you hand le it that is important.thanks,5
368869,"This is a great kimono - pretty color, lightweight. It has some nice (very slight) gathering at the shoulders to give it a little more shape in the arms. The only thing I would change is the sleeve length. In the photo they appear to be a more 3/4 length but mine are much longer, just shy of being full length sleeves. Just keep that in mind! As with all kimonos, you can size up or down to match the fit you're looking for .",5
724107,This is the best belt I have bought for everyday use. It can go with a lot of outfits and it's very sturdy and strong. I've been wearing it nearly everyday for the past few months there is almost no change to the form. I know I will have this belt for years because of how strong it is.,5

Usually something that is one size fits most its too long or the waist is just too tight. These were great for me though.",5
61548,"The band the hospital gave me after the c-section was uncomfortable. These provided the right amount of compression I needed in the right areas. With the ban I needed help to get it closed and for most of the day I was by myself with the baby, which meant for the most part I didn't put it on. With these I felt comfortable and didn't need any extra time getting it on and off. I use them now from time to time for a little extra sucking in, without having to squeeze into spanx.",5
255172,"I love this. It's a bit too big on me but that was a misorder on my part. I love it. I used it for my popstar ahri cosplay and it holds up great to wear and tear! Great quality zipper, and the material on the inside as soft. The whole things is very beatable and moves with you.",5
271994,"These earrings are really pretty and seem like good quality so I really wish I could wear them. However, like the other reviews stated the bars are way too short and barely fit through. The ball is also ridiculously hard to twist on and impossible to do without the help of someone else, so I basically can't wear these.",2
816719,"I thought the skirt would be too long, and I was prepared to cut off some fringe.  However, when I tried it on, I realized there is a short skirt and long fringes, so it looks great!  This skirt is an addition to western wear that I love and it will look wonderful!",5
546084,"Was very disappointed, would not fit anyone larger than a petite person properly. That is it could not be wrapped and draped as shown in the pictures. Also the smell was very chemical and after several hours of airing it lingered. I had it on for about 5 minutes and it made me red and itchy..... I returned it for a refund",1
882666,"It is not Junior sizing. I thought it was juniors so ordered an extra large and the sleeves came down to my fingertips. I returned it for a large, which is still a little too big overall and long in the sleeves. I think a medium would be snug with a sweater underneath. I'm 5' 6"" 145 lbs and wear a 10 in dresses. This is not coat for frigid weather, but keeps me warm. Great for the price I paid.",4
298724,"I like the design, but as several others have mentioned, IT STINKS! Some foreign countries use yucky chemicals to tan leather. I let it sit outside in the sun for a few days to let it ""off-gas"" (yes, that's the term used to describe the chemicals that are released by manufactured products). You get what you pay for.",3
406808,"These are definitely attention getting.  They look good and seem to be made well.  Personally I can't imagine wearing them in public or at a pool, but if you've got the stellar body to pull it off then I guess go for it.  For underwear they work OK, but after an entire day they have made my thighs and butt a little sore.  I'll stick with regular underwear and don't even think of using these for working out!",4
850493,I especially like shirts of this material because they don't shrink.  The only downside is that it does run small.  I saw another review saying to size up so I went with a 2X for my son and it fit.  He prefers an XL and this 2X fit more like a large IMO.  In any case its a great shirt for the quality and price.,4
356309,"Worked very well!! I had purchased some saphire jewelry for my bridesmaids
as a thank you gift. I placed them in these boxes and presented them at
dinner at a restaurant were the lights were dim. When they opened them
their eyes popped and jaws dropped! These are way better than the boxes you
get at the jewelry  store",5
671139,"What an adorably lovely skirt for a great price. I just wore it out to a birthday dinner last night and got several compliments. I read another review that someone said you can't iron the fabric, but mine came a bit wrinkled in the mail and I had no trouble ironing it out gently. The trick is to turn it inside out so you don't damage the silky fabric on the outside. I'm thinking about getting a little petticoat to wear under this to give it a cute little bit poofy-ness. Would definitely buy again in another print.",5
736269,"It is ""cute"" .. but, the purple is next to impossible to see .. not impressed. I had purchased several charms for my Pandora bracelet and when I opened it I did not realize it was the purple one until I came on line to see my orders and noticed it was delivered today.  Only then, did I see the purple if I squinted really really hard. I was hesitant to even give it 3 stars :(",3
472376,It's small and dainty but the chain broke the second time weaing it. Thankfully I was sitting down and  noticed it going south. If it had broken and me not realized it I would've been quite upset. The loop is big enough for a larger more sturdy chain. I woukd highly recommend doing this.,4
80633,I bought these for a costume. I wanted flat shoes to wear all night. They aren't the best as far as comfort. I wore them all evening and night. Kind of hurt my feet the next day. Maybe some insoles would do the trick. But very very cute shoes for what I needed them for. Got lots of compliments and people saying they would just wear them for everyday attire.,5
100333,"This Passport Cover is a good value for the cost.  It's not the best in the world - but I wanted something nice, and in this price range, and I feel like I got what I paid for.  Yes, it's a bit ""puffy"", but I'm guessing if I actually use it, it will compress and be fine.  The color (brown) was accurate to the pictures.  I'd buy this again as a gift for a friend or something.",5
15823,"I just got my shirt.  I was disappointed by the size of the stud holes.  They're regular button hole sized.  Also there are buttons that I suppose might be used instead of the studs. The stud holes on the inside are also button-hole sized.  The problem I was trying to solve was the studs coming unbuttoned, due to the holes being the wrong size.  I may be able to MAKE it work by closing off some of the button holes.",3
60602,"Long line bras are difficult to find in stores now days...I purchased this thinking I was not going to be happy, but I was pleasantly surprised.  This bra is very very supportive.  Years ago I would purchase from a dept store, they no longer carry the line.  This bra is much more comfortable then the dept store, especially on my back.",5
68761,"Great water shoes!  We used these at the beach and camping at the lake.  The fit great and stay on even in muddy lake water. They are pretty easy to get.  Great pink color, they even stayed nice and clean in the red, muddy water at the lake.  My daughter is about 2 1/2 and the size 8 is a little big on her but still stayed put!  They are much better than sandles or flip flops because they keep out sand, crabs, or anything else that might be laying around.",5
350674,"I am not sure if I somehow missed the part where the entire back is sheer see through black fabric or what but I was hoping for a cover up not something see through. It fits as expected and delivery was on the day it said it would be in time for my trip. Seems to be made good, I'll find out how it holds up this next weekend.",3
148995,"Comfy, but I have a 36E bra size right now and usually wear a medium. This was MUCH too small to contain my new boobs. I need at least a size up. It is a little snug all the way around even though my other medium clothes now fit fine. I would order a size up if you want to wear postpartum.",3
51040,"At first when I tried this on I thought it was going to offer great support, but within a few hours it was creasing and rolling up when I sat down. It didn't stay in place at all. It did seem to support my back when getting in and out of bed the first few days, but it was extremely annoying to have to adjust it every time I moved positions.",2
247336,"This dress coming from China was not displayed to me until after I hit the botton to submit my order, had i known I would have never ordered it. Although the dress came in a timely matter it was sooooooooooo small. Ladies if you have curves, don't even think about this one.",1
721938,"Looks great in my friend!  We live in San Diego so he won't wear this often and it should last him a long time. Nice texturing, great quality, and a unique camel color.  Hot on this model as pictured and a good go to combo piece for those chilly or super cold nights. Dress it up or wear it casually as pictured.",5
469323,"I really love this hat, but it is too big for my daughter.  I got it to go with her Halloween costume at 7 weeks old, and she could not wear it.  She is now 4 months and wears it, but it is still a bit big.  I can't leave it on her in her car seat or it will slide down and cover her eyes.",4
802941,"I wear a size 2xl and I bought a 3x. It fits well in the waist but the thighs were tight, I guess that is the slimming aspect of it. I wore it to a party underneath jeggings and one of my coworkers said wow I didn't realize you had such a big butt lol. That's the aim right..Overall it's a great item for the price, it does lift your butt and offers tummy control.",4
400917,"The product was excellent, bu the package was terrible, the box the watch came in was not the correct box, so the it was broken, I did not want to resend it because I will have to pay for postage to resent it and have to start all over again, also I need the gift the same week I got it in the mail.",3
144964,"After using the full nylon wallet for a while, I felt that I just wanted a leather wallet again. This is not as thin as the full nylon, but feels a lot more solid and slightly more cushy. It's worth the price, although beware of the ID window. The adhesive on the inside of the window can squish over to the card, which may be an issue for some. It's very minor, but worth noting.

All in all, a great wallet that doesn't bloat up.",4
252726,"I purchased this bag for my husband's flight to Florida to see his mom. It is the perfect size for a bag that goes under the seat on the plane and met the size standards required by the airline.
We were amazed at how much could go into this bag. It is excellent quality and visually very attractive. The pull out handle made it very
easy to tote behind when walking through the airport to his flight. I may have to get one for myself when I accompany my husband next time!",5

And I live the fact that it covers my stomach but it still makes me feel flattering!",4

263813,Amazing so cute and comfortable and still sexy! They are the only one I could find that does not look old lady and is still flattering and comfortable and  ALL cotton! I hope they add more colors! I'm ordering another six pack! They fit me very well. I have a curvy Frame 504 125 and the smalls fit perfectly. I have no issues with ride up or falling down as one of the negative reviewers said. I'll buy these as long as they are made and I'll save the things for when they are needed only!,5
406836,"The bag is exactly what the description said it was. Perfect for quick trips, or just as a really big purse. I really wish this item came in a better color variety. I think it would look great in Pink w/ white cat/blue cat/black cat, or black with a pink cat/white cat. I love this bag, and take it everywhere!",5
197911,I've been looking for dupes for Triangl bikinis because they are just way to expensive so I came across this one and I love it so much! I ordered a size up (normally a size small but ordered a medium) because of the previous reviews  but I kinda wish I ordered a small since the top was kinda loose. For reference I'm 5'3 115 lbs and 34B. But other than that and a couple creases (that can be flattened under some books) I definitely recommend getting it and I'll be purchasing again.,5
161379,"I purchased this for my son who was going to summer camp.
He really likes it.
It held up for his camp and he still uses it, so that is a plus.

The funny thing is that the Japanese price tag was still on the item when it arrived.
It was marked for about $3.50 once you made the conversion from yen to dollars. ;-)

Not an expensive watch but it held up for my son.
He used it on hikes, in the water and for waking him up in the morning.",5

Im going to try again only maybe a medium this time. Maybe the people leaving reviews about it being small are expecting it to fit like a dress? Its not a dress. Its s shirt.",5
426105,"Since I read it runs smaller, I ordered a size bigger. I usually am a size 6 and ordered and 8 but it was still very small. According to their unconventional sizing chart, I should be a size 16!! I had to return it. I did have some issues with the zipper getting stuck with the sequins and some threads were loose. Nothing major though. However, it is much more prettier in person! The picture does not do any justice. It is gorgeous and elegant, very unique.",5
85321,"I love this.... it's nice and long and fits me just great.  I did read one of the reviews that said that the buttons come off easily, they do.  I've sewn back on 2 of them already, but that's no biggie.  Also, the fabric is quite thin, which is fine with me, I don't like to wear big, bulky things.  It's very flattering on.  I'm 5'6"" and weigh about 165, I've had a lot of compliments on it.",4
266504,Asked in advance if ring could be engraved and was told yes.  What seller didn't share is that because of material engraving is extremely difficult and the label on the inside of ring leaves little room.  As a result my engraving is not visible without a jewlers Microscope and I was disappointed,1

I used to wear Silver Tab Levi's, but the cut of the jean is now so messed up I can't fit into them and feel comfortable. So I ordered two pairs of these Carhartts, and I couldn't be happier.

724119,"TL;DR: Hard to put on and adjust. Great build quality and stylish.

Pros:
Great style
High Quality
Great sturdy buckle

Cons:
Hard to put on and keep taught

This belt looks and feels great, but has a flaw that when you're putting it on, the action of looping the belt back into the buckle causes it to slip. You'll have to readjust afterwards and it's a bit of a hassle.",3
827958,So far they are working well and do not slip off.  There are several strips of rubber on the inside of the heel that keep them from slipping off.  They are a bit thin so I would not recommend walking around in them on carpeted flooring.  Only good for use inside of shoes.,4

I normally wear an XL jacket and purchased this jacket in size Large.  The fit is a little big, but that's fine (leaves room to wear a heavy shirt or hoodie underneath it).  The jacket feels pretty stiff but I'm hoping that it will loosen up as I wear it.",4

My biggest problem with this watch is that it keeps terrible time. The analog portion of mine loses about a second a day and the digital part gains a second a day. So the digital and analog are about two seconds apart per day. That may not be a big deal to some, but it drive me nuts.",3

428997,"really nice quality belt and love the way it has the slight stretch to fit perfectly without being binding at the waist. It looks great on and it would be hard to tell that it is a fabric/elastic material. There are no belt holes as the prong slips perfectly where YOU want it, not where someone predrilled holes. Really fantastic design and quality.",5

I went by reviews and ordered a medium. I am 5'2, 120 pounds, and a B cup bra. The medium is just a smidge loose on me, but overall I love it!!! I'm not sure how to add a picture, but it's exactly as pictured. It has a slip, but your panties will show through. I just go commando. ",5

I gave it to my little sister, and am ordering the next size up for myself!",4
275138,"Overall, I like this belt. First impressions are that it works well, and has the design I was looking for.

Things to note: You have to trim the leather yourself. It's not hard, simple cut with the scissors  and there's marked lines so you know where to cut. I foolishly cut on the same line that I wear I.e. If you wear a 32, don't cut on the 32. I wish I'd left myself some extra belt length for several reasons. I can still wear it, but cut larger than you wear.",5
436648,"Usually I do not wear night gown but this time I was looking for a decent one to put in the bag to take to Labor and Delivery.  This night gown is very nice. The fabric feels nice and cottony, the pattern is pretty. It is roomy enough. I like it. Plus it has opening on the front for easy nursing.",5
417978,"I love New Balance and have been buying there shoes for years. That being said this is the first pair i bought that is not true to the size. they are huge. when i got them i pulled out the inserts and put mine in as i always do. I wore them one day and feet were so tired and sore because they felt almost a whole size to big. Cant return then cause i wore them a day and dicarded inserts, very disappointed",5
108407,"This is a really fine shirt, especially for the money. I was looking for a shirt specifically in this color (light blue) and the low price was a key factor. However, as nice as it was, the fit was too large for the size. I'm a true (L), but I was not too disappointed. Get this: During the first washing and machine-drying, it shrunk a bit and now it fits perfect. Amazing!",5
357263,"I ordered this for my teenage daughter, who is a dancer and very slim. The description of the sizes is not accurate. The material reminded me of her dance leotards and it looked like a tent on her. She chose this for the pattern which looks better in the picture than on the actual dress. Based on the description the Asian small is equal to a U.S. xs. In my opinion it fit like a small on my daughter. If you are a true xs, and very thin this dress will not fit you. It is being returned.",1
460429,"I LOVED the inside of these, there amazing! However I was a little disappointed in the fit, most of the leg was a true legging fit, but the ankles were a little loose and the waist didn't have enough elastic so I found myself doing the pants dance all day!",4
68051,"Such a great hat! Not only is it adorable, but it is very functional and keeps your baby protected. It stays on well and is just enough coverage. When trying to decide what sunhat to get my baby girl the sizing was the most difficult part. I purchased this hat for my two month old daughter. She is about 9 lbs. and it fit loosely, but still fit well enough to wear and she has plenty of room to grow into it. The strap is also very helpful and I appreciated that the sizing was accurate. A great purchase!",5
80001,"For the price, the style, the composition, is the best. I didn't find in stores like this, cute, colored, pretty long cotton socks and I am happy with them. The only thing is that took me a while to unwrap them because each one was packed separately with plastic hanger, tape, plastic bag and some clips :)
Oh, and I have different colors and styles, flowers, butterflies, stripes, yellow, orange, light blue, pink, brown, neutral..",5
878087,"These are so fun and we're perfect for my Disney trip! Definitely worth the price. They were snug and kind of squeezed everything in, which made me a little self conscious, so I put on a longer shirt to cover my behind. The material is that firm slippery feel, not soft, so when it stretches it doesn't become see through.",5
464437,"The item is just nice.
As a reminder, if you want to use it as birthday gift, order it earlier. It was shipped from China, and it took ten days to arrive here in NYC.
The only thing I am confused is that the original battery going with the watch may run out someday, and it seems no way to change it.",5
234823,"This charm looks SO cute on my mom's bracelet. She couldn't even tell that I didn't get it from a Pandora store. It feels like great quality - like what you would expect from the big box retailers. It is adorable! My only complaint is that it came in a cheap looking bag so I had to buy a box to give it to her in. Other than that, it looks great!",5
801309,"Shrinks in wash.  Large really ends up being a medium.  Buy a size larger.

Design on shirt flakes off very easy.
I was hoping to wear shirt a little more often than just 'once in awhile,'  but it looks like I'll just wear for concerts.  Sharp, but fades way too fast after washing.",2
610637,Very pretty but i can only wear it as an underskirt or beach skirt as it is so see-through and when i stretched it far enough to actually fit me rather than the 10 year old it seemed to have been designed for- part of the top lacing unthreaded from the elastic wasteband and now hangs down. It would be perfect for a 10 year old....,2
173880,"I'm so very disappointed in these earrings, I just had to share. Not only did they come all bent up out of shape (I was easily able to bend it back though, which might tell you something how long these will last), the backs that the send with them don't even fit on the earrings!  Unbelievable!",1
830885,"This dress is supposed to hang, which I like. However, the size I purchased was based on my bust size (XL- I'm 5'6, 145lbs, 36DD) but I could have easily purchased a L or even M and it would still hang just fine.
Fabric: It is stretchy and slinky. So you have some give. No slip necessary.
Length: mine came down to my knees, not mid-thigh like the picture displays, but this could be bc I ordered too large.

All in all, I'm happy with it. I'd rather order too large than too small; I'll just take it to the tailor.",4
554775,These are very comfortable tank tops. I did order one size up due to reading reviews about them shrinking and I am glad I did. I don't wear them alone but wear them more like a camisole under my scrubs. They are a bit long but that's better than being too short!,5
21697,"We live in sunny SoCal and I wanted to carry my baby to enjoy outdoor activities.  I was worried about the bright sun so I ordered this little hat to protect my baby. He's only 7 weeks old, and I was a little worried it wouldn't fit, but his little noggin fit the hat with the help of that little drawstring in the back of the hat. It's perfect!!",5
285359,"I think this was made for a 5 year old. I'm 5'9 and it fit like a tube top. The back is no where near loose, and the material is more like a thin long sleeve than a sweatshirt type material. I look like I snuck into the kids section of a clothing store, got stuck in a shirt in the toddler section and had to do the walk of shame to find help.",1
638163,"My 11 year old daughter needed something dressy to wear to her field trip to the symphony, the only problem is she is quite the ""Tom Boy"" when I asked her what kind of dress she would like she just said ""a Galaxy one"". This dress is perfect! The ""stretchy-ness"" of the material makes it very comfortable and with a little black sweater and some black leggings and ankle boots she looks great! She is so excited, and who knows? Maybe she will want more dresses (fingers crossed)",4
548240,"I love love love these.
The classical Symphony leggings were ordered last week and not expected to be here until Monday at the earliest, but they arrived two days early.
Packing was small and neat; for some reason there was a tiny flashlight key chain inside which was absolutely adorable. The fit was nothing unexpected; I have large hips, but I still wear a small and even with my muffin top, which I get whatever bottoms I wear. The leggings are soft and very lovely. I highly suggest this item.",5
369046,I love this product. It fits well and you cant even tell Im wearing it under my clothes. Its way more comfortable than other products Ive tried and the steel boning doesnt dig into my skin. My only reason for giving it 4 stars is the zipper is hard to get up and doesnt want to stay up once you zip it. I would suggest adding a hook at the top of the zipper to help it zip and stay up.  Other than that its great!,4
763063,"Beautiful bag, lots of room, very sturdy canvas. Has a zippered pocket in the inside and another one on the outside, which closes with a metal clasp. It looks like a smaller version of a messenger bag. The print is beautiful. Just an amazing bag. I am in love! =)",5
588195,"simple belt-took long to arrive from China. Good enough for my teen but I wouldn't want one as it's shinny red plasticy fabric, kinds cheap looking but once it's belted, it looks pretty. It's easy to tie as there's a hole in the belt to slip onne side through-I think I sew a few after i've seen this design. Prefect for occasional use.",4
210004,"Well, for $10 this is not a terrible deal. It looks great in the photos and not too bad in person. It feels a little cheap and sounds a little Clanky when loose. Again, this was $10 so I can't really complain. I have attached a couple photos as well including where to size the band.",4
597361,The dress is Adorable. Fits my 11 year old daughter a little snug. The quality is great. It wasn't see thru as others described. My daughter is wearing tights with it as it is a little short. It is not reversible like it says HOWEVER it came with a 24kt gold tiny sticker as a gift.,5
355940,"I'm really happy with this dress. It's comfortable and I love the weight of the material. It's light enough for summer, but not so light that when a breeze comes along that you have to worry about a Marilyn Monroe moment. I love that you can wear it as is or dress it up.",5
630813,This was perfect for my mom after her double mastectomy. I was glad we ordered a size up than what we thought. She lived in this for the first month after surgery. It helped carry the drains and was something easily slipped on and off. I highly recommend this robe!,5
683503,"For the price, this anklet was exactly what I expected. Though I say that, I personally love it. It looks exactly as displayed and arrived a few days ahead of time. If you stretch it out too much the pendant might come off, but it easily goes back on if this happens.",5
784029,"Ya it's definitely a lot smaller than the picture portrays. The maniquin must be a child or small teen, so bust out the measuring tape and look at the dimensions to see if it is what you want. The inside liner feels like a cheap canvas, and the straps don't really allow for easy access to the insides. It is really cute though. The leather is really nice and pretty (I got the blue purse). I'm going to return it though it's to small. Too bad. I'll check the measurements more carefully in the future.",3
67650,"This was an impulse buy for me--I felt in the mood for something sparkly after a rough week, and stumbled on this ring.  For the price, I was a little concerned it might look cheap, but the reviews were all so good, I took a chance.  It's really pretty and sparkly, and even though it has a fairly large stone, it still looks dainty and expensive.  I can't wait for an opportunity to wear it!",5
644443,"I love it so much I ordered another one in a size smaller!
I'll wear the larger one over my bathing suit.  It's my new favorite piece of clothing!  Excellent quality.  I recently had surgery and wore it home to make myself feel better.  Cute with black Capri leggings.",5
269068,Love. This. Bag. Have it in two colors. Holds a multitude. Get many compliments on it. Lots of pockets for storage. I like that feature in a purse. Basic handles are long enough to put over your shoulder and carry comfortably. The longer strap is nice to have also if I'm carrying more than just my purse.,5
440709,"Second time I bought this bag.  Great value for the price.  Looked at all leather versions, but did not seem worth the additional cost.  My last bag of this type lasted 4+ years before the handle started disintegrating from use, but the rest of the bag still looked fine. Less expensive to buy a new one than to repair the handle of the old bag.",5
61706,Great garment for after Csection.  I bought and started wearing a week after because I didn't like the binder.  I like the protective part of garment which is in the exact area where incision was made.  I should have bought a size smaller because I have lost 25 pounds and now it fits loose but I only wear at night.,5
623610,"LOVE THIS DRESS!! My pre-pregnancy stats were: 5'9"", 140lbs, size 4 or 6/small or medium depending on the cut or how forgiving the material was around my hips/butt. After reading some reviews and not knowing how big I would get in my third trimester, I went for a size 8 and I loooooove it!!! It fits exactly as I'd hoped it would, and my husband loves it too!! Highly recommend- great price - I've already worn it several times! 35 weeks, now, and still feeling sexy in the size 8.",5
697845,"I loooove these leggings. Normally I wear a pair of rbx capri leggings for barre but got these because sometimes I don't want to shave my legs. They look goooood. The pattern is not perfectly symmetrical on the thighs but I actually like that.
Material is totally opaque, the waistband stays in place for an hour of sumo squats and planks and mermaids.",5
482562,Awesome! I have the larger wallet with all the compartments as well as the wristlet with phone slot.  I love both of those as well. Sometimes you need a more compact wallet. The leather is smooth and supple. Lots of spaces for cards! Don't be fooled by the small size! Would order again. Been recommending products to all friends and family! Plus bought a few as gifts as well. Thanks for a great product!!,5
370644,"This outfit is very cute but very poorly made. The snaps are super cheap and I don't expect them to last long. The material is very thin as well. But for the price you really can't expect more.  Even though it shipped from China, it came relatively quickly. it runs quite big in my opinion. At least 3-4 months too big. Kids grow out of stuff so quickly anyways.  I would recommend this outfit but just go into it knowing then it's not good quality.",4
198010,"I am 5'2 and 120 pounds. I have a big booty so I ordered a medium because in almost everything else I order a medium fits great. The top makes me have a weird ""granny boob"" look, and the bottoms are way too snug on my bottom. It's a great bikini but if you are like me and have a small chest and a large bottom I suggest ordering two different sizes and selling the sizes you can't fit.",4
419487,Actually brought for Halloween costume for Miss Piggy (for husband) who wears 5xl in men's shirts and it fit perfect.  (No offense to the company who makes these for women). Very happy with quality of product. Came with a catalogue for plus size wear-they looked attractive and well made although I don't wear plus size in women's--did pass on the catalogue to plus size woman who was interested in them and would recommend the company's products,4
671686,"She was very excited when it came in the mail, which didn't take but about a week or so. After reading the reviews I'm glad I up sized it, she's 5 yr old going into 6s && I got the jacket in a size 7 which fit her snug && she's glad I did. Very satisfied!!",5
22518,"Super soft, cute, works for boy or girl, fits my two year old well.  The adjustable drawstring around the hat's base is wonderful.  It allows you to get a great fit.  Now, if this hat could come up with some magical way for my red-headed sun-senstive toddler to not pull it off, then I'd give it more than five stars.  lol",5
879759,"Ok I'm straight up honest, my wife says that's my downfall. I bought one of these, and the day I received it I ordered a second one because my wife stole it! They are incredible, solid, very vibrant, and actually stunning. I have to admit that for the price, you can't beat it! Just beautiful.",5
835759,Very disappointed!  It's super cute and really light weight but the sizes are way off!! I'm a bigger bust area and so I have to order a med but this dress was huge! I don't even think an extra small will fit! Poor sizing! Doesn't match standard sizing!  Runs really big!,1
424451,"We bought this to use as my husband's travel wedding ring (we were worried about theft and losing a real wedding ring while swimming on our honeymoon.) It worked fabulously! He doesn't like it as much as he likes his real wedding ring, but that's a good thing! It looks heavy, but feels light. We wouldn't have wanted to use it for a long-term wedding ring.",5
545981,"Love these tank tops. I use them as undershirts and they fit wonderfully- they truly are a one size fits all! I wear an XL or XXL shirt and they fit me with no problem at all! Great quality fabric, they hold up long term to repeated wear. Love them!",5
797394,"This shirt is adorable! My five year old son loves it. It's thin, which is very nice for hot days of summer, but not so good for a rough and tumble boy who snags things easily and puts holes in his clothes often. The other thing I'm not fond of is that the back is solid white instead of having the blue print like the front. This was evident from the product preview, so I was expecting it, I just don't like it from a design perspective.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.",4
865734,"Nice, but not perfect, product at a good price! It took a little while to get used to, but overall the product is solid. There are other cases out there that are probably better suited for your phone but this one is unique and is worth checking out.

I received this product at a discount for my honest review.",4
518586,"My little girl usually wears a size 11 to 11.5. We bought her the size 12. They fit her great with room to grow. They look a lot better in person. We all really like the way they look. She can dress them up or down. My only complaint is that the brown coloring on the top toe area has started to fade to black. It's not too noticeable right now, but these definitely won't last as long as some of her other shoes. We'll won't be using these as everyday play shoes, but they do look amazing.",4
301571,"Quality is decent, prolly up to par with most similar products. Sizing is terrible!!!! Whatever you think you are go smaller. Measured waist at 34.5 before buying and using the chart that drops down I bought a L, ridiculously huge! So i used the other chart which is the more accurate one, went with a M, no difficulty to get on the tightest setting. Had to return both and go with a small! Can still get the small on the smallest setting...",2
407328,"this is a beautify, sturdy and well made bag.  Unfortunately I have to return it because I was looking for something with more depth to fit my Mac Air and still have the look of a handbag without being too bulky.  This would have been perfect if it were a couple of inches deeper.  Will look for the large size if it exists.  Lovely bag and great Seller service. Arrived in 6 dys!",5
268154,"Pro: The size of this purse for what I carried daily. Shipping was quick. Cons: The large compartment zipper broke after less than a month. I only had an iphone, 2 bank cards, a mirror and lip balm in it at the time. Luckily I was able to have it fixed. Then, 2 months later, the front outer compartment zipper broke and was unable to be fixed. I have been using it flipped around to not show it is broken.",2
129317,"I read on the review that these shoes fit too large and I thought it's just the style of Crocs.  I was surprise by HOW MUCH LARGER they are than expected.  The size actually said 1-3 and should be reflected on the description.  I will keep the shoes for my boys to wear in the backyard only, but not to go to the park or for any active play that requires running or climbing.",3
238142,This is the biggest joke in the world! I bought an xL and it fits like a size 0. I even tried it on my 10 year old daughter who is small and it didn't even fit her. This is a joke. And on its sides it looks like it has wings. Very unhappy!!!!!!,1
575716,"I ordered the Large plus. I'm 5'9' and 175lbs...fit me like the picture. Material was soft! Had no problems with the cowl, capped my shoulders nicely. Sleeves were long, which is normally hard for me to find! Stayed warm for a dinner out in a Chicago Winter! Worm with knit leggings. Really like this dress!",4
405590,"I got this mostly as a joke for a friend's birthday. It was a big hit. The only odd thing was the flap in the back. It looks like a tail, which makes no sense. It might be the main but it's hard to tell. I think it's better without it.",3
467509,"For what is really just a $10 costume accessory, this is a really nice hat. It fit a bit large on my head, but I might be about a quarter inch smaller in diameter after a hair cut since I cut down to a ""zero"" with the electric clippers (military high-regulation fade). With a full head of hair, I reckon this hat would sit very nicely. For 10 bucks, this hat is a bargain.",5
815132,I wanted a bag to use for both purse and camera.  It had to be sturdy and it had to fit my DSLR with my zoom lens. This bag did all that and offers ample space for more stuff than I ever carry.  In the future I could use it for travel as purse and camera bag and a tablet.  I love that it has multiple handles and a strap so that you can wear it cross body style.,5
611547,"super cute selection! My babies all liked different styles, and I love that this pack had multiple kinds.. you won't have to buy a bunch of one jut to find out they hate it-- like my 5 year old hated the skinny band flower so I had to buy thick head bands or cloth ones..  my youngest didn't mind them at all. love that you can get all types at one decent price!",5
647400,"This is a very sturdy, yet very soft key wallet.  It provides excellent protection to my pockets from the sharp keys.  The zipper is also very sturdy, and the construction is very well done.  This item is much better than I expected, and I am very happy with my purchase.",5
630517,"I have only two small concerns: The dress was very wrinkled and difficult to flatten out, and the fabric over the bust was not very stiff, so slid slightly during wear, showing the sides of my strapless bra. A small amount of fashion tape kept it in place, or wearing a bra with slightly less coverage would resolve it as well.

It was beautiful, fit perfectly, and easy to put on and take off.",4
553816,Leg Impressions fleece lined tights were the worst. They came with a hole AND were nowhere close to the right length. I'm 5'7- they should have fit someone 6'0 - nope. I'm right in the middle of the height and weight distribution and these tights were nowhere near fitting. Crotch at my knees. Worst ever - don't waste your time or money.,1
391297,"It's so sleek and beautiful, so I receive a ton of compliments and I love that. I enjoyed setting it up, and customizing the notifications. The sleep tracker is fun. The alarm doesn't work for waking me up, but it's a nice feature. It is a bit big, but that doesn't bother me at all considering all the features it has.",5
68524,The first pair I bought were size 5 thinking my 18month would grow into them but they kept slipping off her feet in the Hawaiin sand so I tossed 'em and reordered in size 4. Much better! I would say they run big so just beware of that but otherwise decent water shoes,4
132036,"This sweatshirt looks great in the picture but it is huge in the shoulders!  I feel like it would fit much better if I had football shoulder pads on!  Its comfy (except for always falling down) so I wear it around the house, but would never wear it out in public.

Its like it was made wrong or something!",2
233061,"I love this thing.  Very minimal.  Carrying 8 cards plus cash, it's not noticeably larger than just wrapping the cards in the cash like I used to do.  Materials look good, construction is very good.  Not sure what the little lanyard thing is for but maybe i'll find a use for it or I'll just take it off.  I looked at every 'minimalist' wallet i could find, chose this one based on description and reviews and I am very pleased with it.",5
79195,"I have these in all colors and love them. They feel like one is walking on air, I'm thinking Nike Wedge Sneakers. They run true to size, a 10 is a true 10 etc., I like the fabric better than the PVC MK Logo version of this shoe as the fabric is softer and molds easily to the foot. Love the shoe and the zipper doesn't bother my foot. Shoe adds height without the pain of a stiletto heel style shoe. Enjoy.",5
502686,"I love the print on this tank top, and this is the second one I've purchased from Friendly Oak (lovely designs). Only problem is the seams around the arm and neck are already unraveling - and I've only worn it once or twice. So not sure how long this tank will actually last, I guess we'll see.",4
857219,"I was super excited to get a cute pair of shorts to give me a little confidence boost and I finally found something that had my size. Then they came in while I was at work, my husband messaged me telling me he was sorry, I didn't understand until I got home. The extra large that fits size 16-18? It's about a size 2, maybe even a 0. I wouldn't be able to get it on one of my thighs and that is extremely disappointing",1
26542,"I buy my shoes a half size larger so the insoles fit in the shoe with my foot comfortably.  These not a cure for plantar fasciitis but they really do help.  Alot.  I put a pair in my work boots, running shoes and hiking shoes and WOW what a difference!  If you're considering these to ease the pain of plantar fasciitis, go for it.  Stretch the calves often and thoroughly, keep a frozen water bottle in the freezer to roll your feet on after exercising and GET THESE INSERTS!  You won't regret it.",5
766007,"I tried to cancel the order and no one would respond. So I am stuck with something I cannot wear.  Aside from it taking too long to get here, summer was over before it showed, the material is synthetic... And the arms are to small for it to be a large.",1
758719,"Simple, not tiny, or too large. Not shiny, cuz it's pewter, but I personally don't like shiny jewelry. Looks worn like I've had it a long time too, which works for me personally as well. I thought it was only the pendant, but it came with a cord already threaded on the loop, ready to be trimmed and tied to the wearer's desired length. 10/10 would buy again.",5
551555,"I am 5'11"" 155bs, and wear a 32G, and I have a huge booty. I bought the largest possible size and it was still laughably small. This happens a lot, so I was not horribly disappointed, but beware if you are at all like me, it's just not the one.",2
701112,After searching everywhere for a checkbook holder for my husband I found this. It was very well made and he loved it. He likes the fact that he can keep extra business cards and gift cards in it and it doesn't keep his wallet over loaded. I would recommend this item.,5
875473,"I love this dress!! It is kind of sheer, but its a mini dress, so I would wear spandex under it anywho. After reading the reviews, I got a L, I'm originally a M. I'm 5'10 and 130lbs. The large fits perfect. It does zip in the back so make sure it can fit around your rib cage. I wore with pants to work since it's a mini dress, and I've gotten SO many compliments! Love this dress so much! Will buy again from this seller.",5
689570,"Coach never disappoints,  it is a great bag for light traveling or just simply going to the beach.  Love the quality materials used to make this great bag,  it is genuine leather and canvas material very resistant to what ever you want to use it for.  I really recommend this bag.  Simply love it.",5
598954,"We spend a lot of time @ the beach & this swim suit got a lot of use. It held up great, the logo pealed off after a couple months of almost daily wear but everything else held up nicely. Easy on & off and kept our baby safe from the sun. Highly recommend!",5
622753,"Would give 5 stars if it was made a little better. Button holes are too close to the edge of the placket and it pulls a little leaving slight gap between buttons. Also, you need to order up about 2 sizes but they are great to sleep in and if I get get called out in the middle of the night I just throw on a pair of jeans and my boots and jacket I am ready to hit the door and it looks great.",4
337858,"I wear an extra small in anything that has that sizing option. I'm a size 0, 110lbs, and slight curves. When I say order up a size, ORDER UP A SIZE!!!! It was a struggle trying to put it on but I did manage. It serves its purpose and gives your butt a NATURAL LIFT similar to squats.",4
388240,"I usually get a large.. but the size chart says a 34C should be medium. So, I ordered a medium.. but I had to remove the pads and stretch out the arms. It's a great quality bra, wonderful fabric. I'm sure I'll be ordering another one of these.. but I'm large!!",5
669402,"My daughter's review: Very well made, the pistols did start to smell like metal fairly quick after I received it.. But, that's to be expected, it's metal. The material used on the outside is sort of water proof, but not completely. Overall, it's a well made purse, and you get what you paid for.",4
703639,"I wish I could give 5 stars as I do love the shirt. I have two others like it but some issues with this one. First, it's light blue purple and black, not white. Secondly, after just one wear the sleeve ends are falling apart. I'll fix them myself but disappointed.",3
648384,"This dress is very cute, comfortable, flattering and affordable dress! I'm 6 months pregnant, 5'1"" and 140 lbs and the size 8 fits me well. It's not too tight or loose. I was on the fence between a 6 and a 8 due to other reviews but I'm happy with the 8. I ordered Crimson. It's a nice color but it much brighter in person. I'm definitely thinking about ordering the same dress in Cappuccino.",4
693610,"I love this product, but as a tunic. I have to wear this with leggings or else ill flash everyone in sight. Also it doesnt really indicate where the front and back are so i always have to guess which side is which. That may not bother others, but it irks me a little",3
639878,Very disappointed!  The place where the strap attaches to the hat  was so cockeyed I noticed it before even took it out of the box and it was still in the plastic!  The holes for the strap attachment are off 1 1/2 inches!  Not even close!  I thought at this price it would be better quality!,1
414229,These are my go to sandals. They look so classy. I ordered them in brown and black. I wear them to work with dress pants and they look terrific. They are so comfortable with the cushioned insole. I love the slight heel. I have a condition where my hands and feet sweat alot and wearing sandals can be dangerous if your feet slide on them. The cloth insole absorbes the sweat and I never slide on them.,5
633964,"Sad to say, it took close to a month to receive the dress.  It is cute, but I ordered an XX-Large and the dress is the same size as my granddaughters children's size 12 dress. It would take forever to receive a refund.  I will allow my granddaughter to use it for dress up play around the house [with a tee shirt underneath for modesty of course]. I do not recommend this purchase.",1
723069,"Works well with my marquis cut engagement ring. Metal is actually brighter than my palladium band. Size was correct and after wearing for a few days I noticed no skin irritation or discoloration. We'll see how the silver coating holds up over time, but for now it will work well as my wedding band.",4
43451,"Good umbrella. It covers my head all around (comes down to about my nose) so I don't get splatters in my face - specially my eyes/glasses which then become a hassle.  It's sturdy even in moderate winds (Chicago winds), and since it's clear, I can still clearly see ahead, despite the raging storm.
Don't let the ""kids"" part fool you- it's big enough for a petite to above average sized woman.",5
591200,"The first skirt I bought of this style was a large, and it was way too big. However the medium I ordered this time is a bit too snug for the teacher in me to wear.  I will probably give it away. The quality is fine and the shipping was prompt.",3
435824,"It's a great dress, and it arrived way ahead of the deadline! It's incredibly cute, not too short at ALL and it's awesome. I bought a size 6/8, and it felt a bit big on me, but when I cinch the belt to the right tightness, it looks fantastic. I feel amazing in this dress, and all my friends complimented me on it!",5
226771,"It is snug through the shoulders and I wonder if that will make it uncomfortable to sleep in. Also it is 100% cotton and if it shrinks I will be in big trouble. The thing is it's beauty. I love the eye-let trim and the style. I want it to fit and be comfortable, not just beautiful.... I have washed it and it did not shrink! Also I have worn it to bed a few times and it is comfortable. I like it very much even if a bit snug in the shoulders.",4
12524,"The absolute BEST insoles for foot pain and plantar fasciitis.  This is the third pair I've bought (so that I don't have to keep moving them from one pair of shoes to another so often). Even my worn out pair (5+ years old) works better than any other brand I have tried.  These insoles literally changed my life, allowing me to walk pain free all day and get out of bed without hobbling the next morning.",5
346639,"This product is great according to my two boys, however, the reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that I ordered 2 of these and both came with clasps that were broken on the chain, and also the keychain clasp does not close all the way and the charms could easily fall off.",4
56238,"This bracelet is very, very pretty. I get lots of compliments when I wear it. The wire is sturdy and strong.
The silver beads have gotten tarnished and very dirty-- I think they are not a terribly high quality material. If you're looking for something to wear once in a while, this is a nice bracelet.",3
17923,"I though that this item would look classy and could be worn out with casual or formal if the person chose to, but then when it arrived it looked like it was made of plastic and was not very sturdy. I believe the day after christmas the gold center fell out of the earrings.",3
336313,Great purse so far. Good for travel or going out with kids. It's made of a nylon material like a tent almost. It's not something you would use for a going out purse but it's great for a mom purse. Color is nice. It's a grey brown color. Very neutral. Love the pockets and size.,5
474607,The CTR is dainty and very hard to see. They seem more like having your initials engraved in a ring instead of proclaiming Choose the Right. The white looks a little like plastic aesthetically. UPDATE--after wearing this ring for most of a month.  I would like to say the white ceramic looks shiny and smooth.  I definitely change my tune about looking like plastic.  I've had compliments on it.,4
869447,I bought this for my son who will not be one until November so I did size up. It is big on him now as expected but should fit perfect for his first birthday. The shirt is very cute. The number is made of a  soft fuzzy material that pops up off the shirt. Decoration is sewn on with no peeling edges etc. made of a lightweight T-shirt material. I'm very excited for him to wear it!,5
498987,My main bag for work. Its amazing. I get lots of complements. My coworker wanted one but no more black was available at the time so she got another brand. This bag is wonderful. Smaller than I expected but I love that it fits my Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 10.1inch tablet. I use it everyday. The quality is superb.,5
506794,I bought this charm for my mother on her birthday and had it shipped to her but once I saw on her bracelet I was very disappointed. It was very small compared to the pic and I couldn't hardly see the word MOM. For as much as it cost I wouldn't waste that amount on this charm.,1
879638,"I ordered this shirt early this week, and although it wasn't Prime shipping it arrived today - much earlier then expected. I ordered an XL because I have a long torso and am expecting some shrinkage - no fault of the manufacturer, I have a knack for shrinking clothes. With that said, if you wash all your clothes with cold water and air-dry order your normal size (mine is a large). Shirt is soft, the green is true to the picture and very pretty, and the print on the front looks great. Many thanks!",5
502879,"THIS COMPANY NEEDS TO BE ASHAMED SELLING CHEAP PRODUCTS, THAT LOOK NOTHING LIKE THE PIC WHEN YOU GET IT. THE WORST PRODUCT I'VE EVER BROUGHT, AND A WASTE OF MY MONEY, THATS WHAT I GET FOR TRYING  TO SPEND LESS THINKING THE QUALITY WOULDN'T CHANGE. TRUST ME AVOID THIS COMPANY AND THERE PRODUCTS",1
796037,"For the price I paid, I definitely cannot complain. Be warned however that this dress definitely will leave you with an armpit rash from the sequins, but that's nearly unavoidable with sequins.

I am 5'4"", athletic build, 36D. I normally fit into a small or medium in stretchy material. I bought a large in this dress and it fit perfectly. It was still very short and I couldn't bend over at all, but this was for Vegas, so it all worked out.",4
580356,Picture is deceiving.  It looks like a toy pendant for a child and cheap looking. It was mailed directly to my mom as a Christmas gift.  My brother took a picture called me and was laughing.  I apologized profusely to my mom but she loves me just the same.  Not recommend anyone purchasing this product.  Ordered on Dec. 13 and it arrived on Dec. 24 (11 days).,1

Night out on the town for Halloween.
Show Premier and another night it on the town.
A 5k.

The painting looked like it was done by a youth group. And the seams pulled super easy, but it made it through what I needed it to.",4
109821,"We've looked in many stores for this coin purse, with no luck. Amazon had it, of course! The hubby has been without one for ages and is happy as a clam with his new, old-style coin purse. Having others in the package ready to be used when needed is a bonus.",5
687022,"Loved this dress, especially for the price! I read the reviews before I purchased and I definitely recommend ordering a size up! The material is thick and great quality. The straps are not adjustable but worked for me. I am 6foot tall and I thought the length was pretty good (I wanted something short, but not too short for a Vegas trip). May be a little long on girls closer to 5 foot. Overall, great purchase and great quality with bright, beautiful colors!",5
836534,"I bought these underwear for my husband to wear. When they arrived I took them out and they were so soft I couldn't wait for him to wear them. He put them on and said they felt great and were very comfortable. I couldn't keep my hands off them when he was wearing them, he looked so sexy and the material is awesome.
I bought this product at a discounted price for an honest review.",5
374217,"My bag measured 7 in. by 4.75 in.  My Fire HD 6, which is 6 5/8 in by 4 in., is a tight fit in one of the larger sections.  The middle compartment has an additional zipper.  This is great for when you want to go out lightly with only essentials, such as keys, some money & credit cards, and a phone.",4
810546,"HUGE LOGIC FAN!! I ordered this for my bro's birthday and he loves it and even looking at it I feel like I might order one for myself (;
Picture accurately represents product. Product is comfortable to wear and does keep you nice and cozy. Shipping was as expected. Thank you.",5
514624,"These are a very easy fit and comfortable to sit in, but the problem is that the waist stretches too much and becomes very loose making it impossible to keep them up. They constantly slide down making it very difficult to wear. It may be better in a smaller size. I ordered my normal size and the fit is great if it were not for that loose waist that will not stay up. If the waist were smaller, these would be very comfortable.",3
735809,Love this case! I have people commenting on it all the time. Its very minimalistic and it's nice to just carry around this thing in your pocket. Its great for bringing just the things you need. Instead of having this huge wallet with you with tons of junk in it.,5
826052,"Runs small and the lace pattern is different. Normally I wouldn't care too much but there are larger gaps in the lace where my nipples rest and they work their way in the lace which is both uncomfortable and obnoxious. I wouldn't recommend for anyone with larger breasts. I bought a large, I am 34D.",3
404079,"While the Watch Winding Box is pretty, it is ""top-heavy"".  Meaning when you open the lid to place or replace your watch inside, the lid keeps falling down on your hand.  Lid doesn't stay open, the lid is heavy, so it isn't something you can ignore because it hurts when it hits the back of your hand and there is no brace to keep the lid open.  I'm disappointed in this issue with the lid, not sure I like this.",2
27411,"I have plantar fasciitis in both feet and have been using prescription orthotics for several years.  These have been a great substitute for me, I've been using the Powersteps for well over five years now with no return of the pain induced by plantar fasciitis, even considering I spend all day at work walking around on concrete.  Depending on the shoe, I use the full length or the 3/4 length version, both perform equally well for me.  I can heartily recommend them!",5
210312,This was a lovely addition to the brides wedding attire.  She ended taking lots of pictures with it on.  The bride is always cold but found the wrap very warm in her very chilly evening.  She looked beautiful and she stayed very warm and received a lot of compliments on the wrap.,4
445942,Perfect for replacing the smaller backs that come with earrings.  Gradually I would purchase from my jeweler a set of sterling silver large backs for $25 a set.  I figured there had to be a more economical solution. So I ordered these Honora earring backs which were better than the $25 a set back from  my jewelers.  Very pleased with my purchase.,5
404078,"This necklace arrived today and was nicer than i thought it would be especially for a costume piece. The spider is large and has black gems which gave the necklace more brillance and depth. My only disappointment is the chain isn't adjustable so you can't make it shorter. Otherwise, very happy with quality and value of item.",4
531031,"Do NOT waste YOUR money!!!! This skirt is for a small child or a little person. NOT a full grown human being. I had my 5'2 daughter, my 5'4 Mother and my 5'8 self try this on and it looks ridiculously short on all of us!!!!! The color is also not the same as shown. It's more of a dirty pink. YUCK! SOOOOOOO disappointed :(",1
190915,"Amazing how a $7 watch band can dress up a $51 watch. I purchased a Stauer $200 watch for $51 delivered. Great looking, all stainless, very readable (important to a 76yo person), but, it had a minimal quality leather band. And,  I don't like leather bands in hot-sweaty south Florida.  This mesh band fit perfectly (is adjustable), cool to wear, cool looking, and matched the watch face 24mm width. Easy to put on the wrist but still solid enough to endure riding a Harley.",5
174363,It does look expensive from far. The three large rhinestone on the front is foggy and not place in the center. I could have done a better job. If I could find better rhinestone I would replace them. The chain that came with the rose gold colored clutch is GOLD color?come on,3
374466,"I was pleasantly surprised at how well this fit. I was afraid the lace would stretch out and that this would end up looking frumpy for my cousin's wedding, but it fit perfectly. I wore a white bra underneath it and you couldn't even see the straps through the lace really. Just be aware that if you wear this without washing it first, it will turn that white bra temporarily purple. The purple washed out of my bra though. Love this top.",5
283545,"Great suit. Nice vintage look. The only thing I didn't like was that the top and bottoms couldn't be different sizes. The top was a little small while the bottoms fit perfectly. Was able to use it for a photoshoot, and really like it. Great for moms who want a cute suit and want to cover that baby pooch! ;)",4
580298,Very pretty coat!. I had just bought a down coat on black friday from JCPennys and the zipper went out in a month. I spent the same on this coat and it is a much superior product for the same money. The lining is very pretty with a pocket inside for a phone. The zipper is heavy duty and should last! Very happy with the purchase.,5
213011,"Shipping was fast so 1 star for that! I ordered the blue bikinni. It seems paper think. Might fall apart if i get it wet! The quality is ridiculously terrible. My sizes are 32DDD, 129lbs, 5ft 4ins and i ordered a large. The top was way to small. Boobs poppin out all sides. Bottoms were ok fitting but only cuz of the strings on the sides. Originally i ordered this bikinni cuz i wanted the scrunched bottom but these came as regular bottoms...not what i ordered! Very disappointed! DONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID!...such a waste of money! =(",1
122652,"I bought this hat for a 2 year old, it is just a little large but not by much.  He is able to keep it on his head without using the draw string, but he likes the string.  He looks so cute in it.  Our original purpose was to keep the tops of his ears from getting sunburned and I know it will do that because he does not want to take it off--at all.  It is a hit with this little boy!",5
444242,"cute...looks just like pic. after being washed and dried in tumble dryer 3 or 4 times here are the measurements with it laying flat on the bed:

armpit to armpit (same at hem) 23.5""
back neck to hem: 36""

seems to be well made. the cotton is just a little bit stiff and rough...not bad but definitely not the softest (so far).",4
419434,"Nice quality cotton gown.  Perfect weight & length for winter time.  Heart print is fun.  Background color is kind of a tan / beige / pink than a redish or bright pink color.  Washed up nicely with little or no shrink.  Just ordered a second gown because I like the first one so much.

Update 8/22/16 - Moon and stars gown arrived. Fabric had a little odor to it but disappeared after laundering.  I'm 5'3"" and gown comes to just below mid-calf after washing & drying.",5
351645,"These are aweful. I ordered a large, it's like they made a medium size leg and an extra large waist. Awkward to wear, they kept rolling down and they don't hug anything or support your waist. Fit in the front but Barely covered my bottom. When I excercise I have to be comfortable. They were cheap....and that's what I get.",1
289538,"I usually love zmart and have a lot of therir socks. They fit great and are fairly well made socks. They hold their color well too. However, I am only giving three stars because when my socks arrived two pair were clearly used socks. They had hair stuck to the bottom and were filthy and gross.. I do not understand how this mistake is made by zmart. I understand they can be washed and worn. But it's the principle that I paid for new socks. Not nasty used socks.",3
233031,"I love how slim this wallet is. I was able to fit everything i needed into it. I does not bulk up my pockets and is easy to use. I feel everything is secure and won't fall out. Its so thin, i am often checking to make sure i have not forgotten my wallet. (You know, the panic pocket taps)

Definitely buy this wallet if you are looking for something that is easy to use and slim.",5
444502,"This is the first pair of 'real' skinny jeans I own, and when I got them in the mail (they came a few days before the est. delivery date), I was surprised at how small they were. I ordered a size 9 (which is a bit bigger than I normally wear), and they looked a size or two smaller. Once I put them on and stretched them out over a few days, they fit like a charm. I have no complaints other than they being a bit too small until you stretch them out.",4
132291,"It has thickness of a sweater so im going to try to wear it as much as I can before the weather gets too hot, it can stretched over your bottom if your wearing leggings/jeggings or around the waist like a regular top, I love the variation very soft and very comfortable, bought an XL and it fits like can XL",5
769974,"Can't be used for maternity because the bottom hem is too small. I wish it had a few princess seems at the waist under the bust so it would lay nicer.  I ordered a size up because of the reviews that it runs small. The sleeves are just a little too short for long sleeve and not long enough for 3/4 sleeves. I will be tailoring it so it will fit me better, because I love the pattern and overall style.",3
798600,I love this pencil dress! It is very pretty I can wear to work and then they could spice it up and wear it out to the club if I want to. The material is absolutely awesome it's very comfortable I've had a lot of compliments on it. I definitely recommend this and you can wear it to work at the club every day that's the great thing about it.,5
822583,Magnetic piece broke within a week of light and careful use and I kept trying to repair it since I loved the bag so much unfortunately after I spent money at the hardware store trying to repair it with different glues no luck (the fabric was ripping) I gave up. Then two days later after that the zipper completely ripped off the middle pocket..upset I had this experience because intitally this was such a great bag,1

As far as care I would air dry the shirt, it may shrink in the dryer.",4
755402,"This is WAY to short to fit as a dress, It doesn't even cover my butt! I'm really disappointed as I was really looking forward to having this dress, however, it does still work as a blouse.

194580,"This is a wonderful, beautiful rhinestone necklace. I wear this against a solid color turtleneck sweater and the necklace just pops! Always a statement piece and I'm always complimented on it and asked where I got it. It can be worn with reds, blues, purples, greens, black or white. This necklace will be amazing against any color!",5
130184,"I originally purchased the medium 2 pack from CVS and really liked these bras. I went to Amazon for a better deal and found a 3pack in pretty colors for the same amount of money. But what I like best is that these Amazon mediums fit a bit more snug than the mediums from CVS, and I really appreciate that. I love that the cups come out so you can wash them in the machine, just put the cups in when the bras are dry. I would love to have these in every color!",5
430323,I bought this for my sixteen yrs old sister as a Christmas present. I love how fast the delivery was. I of course went over the product when I got it. Its beautiful. I love it has its own jewelry box that matches the necklace easy to store at this time easy to hide since she won't get it til xmas . I'll let you know how she liked it after xmas .,5
688882,"I loved it! The hoodie is so cute and all my BTS friends are jealous haha. I got a small, thinking that it would fit well but it is surprisingly a little bit too small. It still fit okay and all I gotta do is make sure I wash it with cold water haha. Other than that, the hoodie is adorable and I recommend getting a size up for a comfortable fit.",4
863616,"This is a good looking and well-made purse.  It's small but holds a lot if that makes sense.  I love the visible zippers and the contrast in colors between the silver and black.  The description would limit it to being appropriate just for young girls but I disagree, anybody will look good carrying this purse.  Nice price too.  Just buy it, you won't be sorry.",5
490801,I feel like buying clothes online is a bit of a gamble but thankfully this one paid off. I am 5'2 with a large chest so I can't really wear this as a dress but it works well as a shirt. The material is extremely soft & comfy! If it was too big I would probably use it to sleep in.,4
119431,"This item is very cheaply made but in all I thought it was very cute and if taken good care if, it is functional. The real issue is the time it took to receive it. Shipping all the way from china is not quick but if you have the patience then it worth $2",3
192687,"When this arrived with the Chinese language all over it (tags, labels, etc.), I knew I'd been had. There's not even a receipt in English. The surface film is scratched with bubbles in the film. It's very poorly made.

Given that, I certainly think it's a rip-off of a legitimate product (very common there). I highly doubt that this has any UV protection at.all. This is cute for a gimmick or gag gift in lieu of the V. Stiviano controversy. Otherwise, be wiser that I was when purchasing one.",2
144039,"Never thought I'd pen a croakie review...BUT...
These just make SO much sense.
They are a great length, and the rubber holders are the
best I've seen by far.
They don't slip and fit on the frames at the exact spot
that allows them to hold the frames without the cords
dangling on my cheeks.
The key chain repair kit is a nice addition",5

I'm a 38B and ordered large and they are REALLY snug, probably should've ordered xl. I needed them for post lumpectomy surgery and they definitely hold everything in tight. Zipping them can definitely be a challenge however in my case I'm very sore so I have to be careful and have my husband help. Overall great quality and super comfortable.",4
624598,"This was a jacket for my son.  I ordered it just a little bit big, because I know that he will ""fill out"" as he grows.  (He's only 15 now)

The jacket looks very nice, and my son likes it.  It was a little lighter weight than I expected, but here in Florida, that's not a bad thing!

For the price I paid, I would order it again.

My son and I were looking for a coat a little more like what is in the game, but for the money, we are happy with the purchase.",4

78369,"These were a good deal.  Brand name product, fit well.  Bought these for my 20ish aged daughter who has small feet.

Highly recommend!",5

I'm 3 1/2 weeks post tummy tuck and experiencing a lot of swelling/bulging above and below my belly button. my doctor didn't like the crease i was getting from the compression garment so he gave me foam to use. the foam was not helping at all.  I'm so happy i found this product. my tummy is so flat and the pleats are smoothed out after just one day.,5
865658,I can't even accurately describe the way this dress DID NOT fit as expected. The upper portion of the dress was HUGE but the bottom portion was so snug it looked like an entirely different dress. I am moderately pear shaped with only about a 2.5 inch differential betwen my hips and my chest but based on the fit of the dress you would expect it to be much different. The only good thing I have to say about the dress is that it looked exactly as pictured and was the quality expected based on the price.,1
496592,"I am not a fan of any sneakers, however these are as good as they get.  I spent my life not knowing that I fit into girls sneakers instead of adults due to my wide toes and super narrow heels.

I'm transitioning from relaxed to natural, and this makes a beautiful headwrap for those days when my hair won't cooperate. It's very long, which allows me to style it many different ways. I hand washed it and hung it up to dry, and it didn't shrink or fade.",5
835436,"Wow! I honestly didn't expect this to fit so well. Very cute design. I never quite fit into swimsuit bottoms (I have an hour glass figure) so it was refreshing to not be spilling out of these. The top provides some support but not a ton so wouldn't recommend for anyone bigger than a C cup. The back design is cute and doesn't get tangled, and was easy to put on.",5
798342,I bought this for my wife and she loves it! We bought it in a large since it's Asian sizing and runs small. She typically wears a small/medium. The large fits perfect! Fabric is soft and stretchy and is not very see through. Also has good armpit coverage so your bra doesn't poke out.,5
407478,I bought these ribbons for my PE classes. I use them with about 100 students. They get really tangled and some of the ribbons came off the first time they were used. I think it would be better to buy a higher quality ribbon that will last. I don't think these ribbons will last 1 school year!,2

174269,"A little snug for an X-Large, but fits pretty good.  I think when you have something coming from other countries such as China (whose clothes I believe are much smaller than USA version of XLarge) should be noted.  Just my 2 cents worth.  But I do like it!!",4

For those that put bad ratings on it, for the price asked, especially when on sale, you can buy several and still have outwear anything more expensive. Believe me. I've purchased the $80 and $115 belts and they go after time, also. Rather buy two or three of these and get the same tenure.",5
228029,"My husband loved it! It is definitely for the bedroom, too short to wear in public unless with shorts under but I'll take the sexynes of the costume specially in the back ;). I'm 5'2, 32B, I wear size 0 for jeans and the skirt and top fit perfectly! (Top and socks are very strechy) The socks were such a plus, they actually stay in place and I was able to wear high heels and be comfortable all the time. I absolutely recommend this.",5
405334,"I wore this for halloween this year, and it was so so cute!  I got a lg/med because I figured it would run small, and it did.  It's made out of stretch material, though, so it wasn't too big a deal.  It doesn't come with a petty coat-thing, so you have to get that separately.",4
346757,This dress did not have the quality at all of what it look like in the picture. It was cheaply made to me. The size did fit. It just wasn't flattering st all. I ended up having to go to the mall and buy me a dress and used the shapewear I previously had.,1
201,"It is refreshing to wear these earrings because they don't make my earlobes swell up. My ears are too sensitive for ""sensitive"" earrings and I was about ready to give up and resign myself to clip earrings. Fortunately I found these. They are more expensive than other earrings due to the metal, but well worth it. It's like my ears don't even know they're there :) .",5
700814,"After reading the reviews of the other buyers, I was a bit scared to find out that the thickness of the fabric is worse than expected. But it isn't too bad!! All I need is a nude/tan colored underwear and a half/full nude/tan slip and I'm good to go! I love how it fits me! :)",5
321481,"The aspiring goth in me had to have this septum ring. It looks great and goes very well with lacy black clothes. However, if your septum piercing is higher up (like mine), and/or if your webbing is a little thick, the clicker is difficult to maneuver on this ring. It is worth the effort, though!",4
744113,"I bought this for my pre-teen daughter. I used the measurements shown in the photo feed at the end. Spot on! It fits perfectly! It's such a feminine shape, and modest. The fabric is thick and feels very well made. I will definitely recommended, and may even buy another in a different color!",5
690982,"The sizing guide said I should order and XL but the dress was so incredibly tight around my breasts, I think a 2XL would have been the proper fit for me. Would be fine if you have a very small chest. Wish it would have fit as I loved the rest of it.  Has to return it.",3
427979,"Just discovered Leveret PJs on Amazon. These are very cute, soft and comfortable cotton PJs at a very good price. Thank you Leveret! My son saw them online and wanted them all, so I ordered 10 different styles for him (he is almost 4, so I bought them in size 5 - great fit with room to grow). He likes to wear a different set every night. I only wish they came in larger sizes so we could keep enjoying them...",5
699553,"I have every color made of this model with multiples in blue, white, and orange. I often work on solar projects as an electrician and the material these shirts are made of is great for keeping cool. They are also low maintenance in that they do not wrinkle and dry very quickly on low heat.",5
237949,"Bought this as a replacement for the original case that came with my Ray Bans. This product is definitely fake. Material is plastic, not leather as it should be. Flap is too long, so snaps don't line up as they should. The lining is not correctly installed and attached to the outer shell. May look similar from afar, but there is no way it is real or even a quality product.",1
222836,"This does not look like it does in the picture. It was awful, cheaply made, and a big disappointment. Luckily I had purchased another set of ears for my halloween costume as a back up. I don't like writing bad reviews on amazon, but I'm writing this so people don't waste their money thinking theyll get the ears that are in the pictures.",1
583729,"Loved this costume  - everything pictured (minus the shoes) came with it. It was all of decent quality!

4 stars is because the top was a little too big for me, I'm a size 0 and was a little bulky up top. I made it work with a push up bra :)

see pic!",4
429636,"I received this item 2 days ago and was immediately surprised when I saw it. The colour of the band was a lot brighter than displayed in the picture, however, it was still stylish and contemporary. My teenaged daughter promptly claimed it as it is very youthful and vibrant. It can be worn with any colour and makes a statement because it does have an unusual band!",4
316012,"For me, who has gained fifteen pounds, all in my belly, these jeans are heaven sent: My butt and thighs are not large and these jeans, that pull on comfortably over said belly, are incredibly flattering. They loosen a bit around the thighs and rear, but not too much. I wash them in cold water, inside out, and line dry, and voila! I have two pair and actually feel they will motivate me to lose said belly, because I can feel sexy and good about my body.",5
827409,"I got these in a size 4 for my son's 8th birthday. He is usually a size 3 and they fit him perfectly. They run small. For $29, these shoes aren't bad at all. We did have a bit of a scare only an hour after he wore them: One shoe was stuck on a white light. It would not turn off no matter how many times we pushed be button. I put them on the charger overnight and they reset the lights on the shoe. Now they back to working condition. My son is happy and loves them.",4
543114,"Nice cap! I've got a fairly big head (59 cm) and this fits perfect. There is plenty of material so I don't have to stretch it like a skull cap to get enough ""flop"". I wear it in a relaxed look (just above my eyebrows and half way down on my ears) with a few folds around the edge and it looks great. The material is a little heavy for summer wear though. It would probably be too hot on a day that went above 75 F.",5
84808,"Wow!! I just received my bracelet today and was VERY pleased on how it looked and how comfortable it feels and how it fit my wrist perfectly. I was a little anxious about how it would look and feel while wearing it. I'm thinking of buying another one, just in case.",5
604084,"I love this dress! My only complaint is that its a little tight in the shoulder/back area but im a little broad shouldered as it is. But i feel that that can be over looked by the fact that thos dress has POCKETS! Pockets people! Real ones, not those little baby pockets that you can barely fit a chapstick in! To me that trumps a little tightness is the shoulders",5
744204,"Very, very cute bow tie. It feels like it is great quality and the velcro has held up well through putting it on and off one if my dogs multiple times. I purchased this to actually have my small dog wear for when my husband comes home from deployment. It's very patriotic and cute. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review, however that did not sway my opinion on it one way or another.",5
146709,"took a gamble on this hat, loved how the pics of this item looked, wanted to try a different style to my wardrobe, received hat & fits slightly big, but thats do to my bald head (no hair) had I had hair it would fit perfect.

still fit is good on me & looks very classy & modern for a young guy like me in my late 30's.

Look forward to sporting this hat for the right occasion/event soon.",5
408144,"We have used these bracelets for sharing encouragement to many Native American friends. I have to get a new supply every few months, thank you who make them!  I wish we could contact the makers directly and let them know where they are going!  Arizona, New Mexico, California, Philippines, Hawaii, Mexico, New Zealand, Australia...  What a nice little gift they are to share love with our tribal friends.",5
849117,"Took the hat on a trip to Mexico and the hat did not hold up well. It rained while we there and once the hat got wet in wrinkled easily and lost it's shape. The hat is attractive but too flimsy.

***update***

The company reached out to me and provided me with a full refund.",5
9218,I bought one size larger because I know vans run small but they still feel like there two sizes small.. I love vans been wearing them my whole life but if you get these and have a wide foot I would order three sizes bigger then you foot size at least,3
56543,I had to wear these for my last two pregnancies. developed varicose veins. can't imagine how uncomfortable walking would be without them. the footless tights were a must in cooler weather. I found them to be true to size. and they held up well washed in a lingerie bag and hung to dry. I bought a few nude and two black to rotate.,5
46755,I had purchased these for my elderly mother.  The outer ridge is to hard and totally inflexible.  I found them VERY difficult to put on and I know she wouldn't have the dexterity to handle them.. I thought they would have an elastic edge which would allow easier and softer handling.  I had to return them.  Sorry.,2
533795,This dress is very tropical an flow. I can't wait to wear it. However I am usually a size small and I'm glad that I went a size up and ordered the medium because the small would have been too tight around the waist and the length would have ben too short. So definitely order a size up. Its a sheer dress however its not as see through as you would think. This can be worn as is pretty and vibrant,4
488707,"theses earrings are well worth the wait, i stumbled across them while looking around and i don't regret ordering them one bit, the price is dirt cheap and i had to wait a month as it came from china but omg it was so worth it, people love them around here cause no one has anything like it i now have 8 or 9 different pairs!",5
515406,Love this if only it fit! I ordered a XXL because I assumed it was coming from Asia. I normally wear a large or XL depending on the item. But this will not even fit my shoulders. A shame really because it is well made and very cool. The only thing marked down is the fit.,3
316086,"I like the  black color a lot, I've bought the normal blue denim a few time and I thought it would make a fun change. I wear my pajamajeans exclusively, and I wear them to work and coworkers have told me they never would have guessed if I hadn't told them. Just be aware that if you have wide hips (like I do) you'll need to wiggle into these a bit, the waist band has the least amount of give on the whole thing but after you wiggle past the waist band, they fit amazing.",5
454767,"The dress is darling--I wish it was bigger! I wear a size 4/6, and it was much too small for me. Another commenter complained that the belt could wrap around her twice, which is hilarious...the photo shows that it's a belt that wraps around twice! Also, the wrinkles another commenter complained about are pleats. They are pleats.
Quality is nice--fabric is nice--color is cute. It's a darling dress. Just wish they offered a M/L that would fit me!",3
398041,"Excellent clarity. Good, warm rose tint that reminds me of the old SunCloud glasses of ten years+ ago. VERY lightweight---I forget that I am wearing them. Developed a crack in one lens at a fastening point; not sure if it's product weakness or my stretching the frame. No matter, since I scratched that lens and have sent the glasses back for repair. I am pleased that repair is an option, because I love these glasses.",4
213201,ok. I got the smallest size and still very frumpy on me. Since it makes big bumps can look strange under tight fitted clothing. I use it to work out in and that works good so would probably give it three stars for that but because It's not really what I was expecting 2 stars. I wish I would of just put the money I spent on this for another authentic steel boned corset. I've been waist training for awhile & wanted Something to wear while not in a corset,2
438363,I bought this because it looked sexy but semi-modest. I wanted to be able to walk around my house in this nightdress and not fell ashamed. It is perfect and true to size. I'm kind of heavy with big boobies and the extra large fit me perfectly. I was surprised that it actually fit over the girls. I would order this again in a heart beat and I would order more if it came in different colors.,5
511255,"Very cute but it bled quite a lot when I washed it in cold water.  The color is pretty and it's cute and swingy and short as pictured (I'm 5'5"" - definitely a mini).  Just wash it by itself the first time.  I washed it in cold water with some other colored clothes and the dye showed up on the other things.",3
457757,"When this wallet arrives, you may ask yourself if you were out of your mind. It seems flimzy, like nothing. But I found it very useful on a recent trip to Colombia and it is indeed well made of good material. I used this as an extra wallet for my Colombian currency for a month. It was so thin that it had no bulk in my front cargo pants pocket. Love this wallet and will use it again when travelling in foreign countries.",4
860854,Hot topic was awesome to work with but this product is VERY fragile. I received the first one broken (shipped in a padded mailer). Got a hold of hot topic and they were great. Shipped a second one...... broken worse than the first. The crown on the top is attached with very little metal to the main part. I ordered a 3rd one directly from hot topic and it was packaged in with a few other items and survived the trip. It looks great and was larger than we expected.,1
849713,"This cap is too small in general, it will expand to fit any size head, but the cap structure it self only expands to about 7 1/4, any thing bigger than that and the strap in back bulges out and looks stupid.  Material and build seems good, this cap is just not big enough for anyone that has a cap size larger 7-7.25.. i would expect it will fit women and youth great.",2
78845,"I am a plus size grandma that doesn't like to wear granny panties. These briefs fit like they were custom made for me, they don't ride up and don't cut into my hips, they come slightly below my belly button and leave a smooth no show panty line. They wash and dry beautifully. I would think the only reason you don't find these comfortable is because you are not wearing the right size.",5
808619,I bought this item for a 50s themed event and it did not live up to the picture. I got a size I thought would be a bit big but it ended up being smaller than expected. warning: it does not fit as it is pictured. the waist is higher and the skirt is shorter than a traditional 50s dress and it just overall fits awkwardly. the material feels very cheap and not very comfortable. I would not recommend,1
111362,"Not very long.  There seems to be two types of XXL shirts.  One for tall people and one for wide people.  This is for wide people.  I'm six foot four and this barely covers my belt.  Print is good and bright just like the picture but it is on the short side.  Good shirt though, held up through two washes so far.",3
53475,"Someone wrote that their child was sweating profusely in this hat as there was no way for their head to breathe. I told my friend that if her baby's head started sweating that much, perhaps she needs to get her into an air conditioned environment. The hat is cute and has mesh lining in it. There is a tie to keep the hat on, but the kid was not cooperative in letting us do this. She can still get away with this though because she is just that cute.",5
405323,"Good little go to shirts for summer! My girly is tall for her age and I was worried these might not be long enough, but they're perfect. The colors are a little more pastel than I thought, but the material seems sturdy and they haven't faded after a few washes. Would purchase again.",5
121706,"Waaaay too tight! I wear a medium unordered a large because they said it ran small. But man! It fits like a small I didn't even get to wear it I gave it to my sister, she wears a xs and it fits her perfectly! Smh it would of been nice to wear.",1
272355,These are pretty funny looking when worn.  Not really for small children (age 2-3) as they are too large to stay on their head.  More suitable for 6-7 year old.  There are others on the market that are smaller in size for the younger crowd.  Overall it is worth the money.  Seems durable.,4
178342,"I love this because it is one-of-a-kind. I was looking for something for my sister who is grieving the loss of her dog who died right before Christmas. It seemed that I would not find anything appropriate to comfort her a little bit. This is an excellent idea for those who need to feel that their dog is happy and watching over them, and will meet them at the Rainbow Bridge. Thank you for making such a lovely remembrance.",5
67535,"Omg!!!! I love this ring!!!! So pretty and the stone is just the perfect  shade of green.. I dpnt wear colored stones as a rule, but  I'm getting imto them. If you decide to purchase this ring, you won't be disappointed.. Well worth the price. Just ordered a lemon quartz  ring from the same distributor. Can't wait to get it!!!",5
524057,"Great style. Elastic material makes this fit a US XL size. However, fabric a bit bad quality on the sewing. Need a bit work after you bought home. Got loose thread and parts haven't been sewed... Other than that, no complain if you can handle the sewing part by yourself.",4
459119,This is a beautiful belly bottom ring. I have had it for a while and it still looks brand new. I would definitely purchase another one if something happened to it. Its definitely a great price. I have had no problems with it changing colors or irritating my skin. I have very sensitive skin. I can't normally wear anything fake. But this has did wonders.,5
336770,"Love this. Always wanted one. It looks great as part of a costume and great for the price. Would not use as more than a toy. It is thin and could break. As long as you're using it as costume, you'll love it. I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my open and honest review. The review is 100% my own.",4
102400,"They are Hanes, but they are very lightweight and see through.  I was looking for something to replace my Stafford that is heavyweight and was hoping that since these were ""classics"" they would be of a heavier weight.  Oh well, they were cheap and you get what you pay for.",3
710304,"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM OR ANYTHING FROM THEM!! IT LOOK NOTHING LIKE THE PIC. POORLY MADE. IT LOOK LIKE CRAP!! CHEAP MATERIAL, AND CHEAPLY MADE! IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO RECEIVE IT.

64074,"My kid is a super grover fan so he was pumped to try these out. they're a little tight and my kid is a 50 percentile tyke, so keep that in mind when you order them.

He insists on wearing them and this is good because we are learning to use the potty.",4
391637,"I think this is a nice sleep shirt.  It does fit a big snug and is a very lightweight cotton but that will be nice for the hot summer coming up.  Overall, I am glad I purchased it.  NOTE:  I did receive this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",4
482020,I really like this ring. it's got a smooth inside finish and the knotwork is seamless all around the ring. It does seem a little bit snugger than another ring that I have of the same size. (It is possible that the other ring may be off). I really like this ring and highly recommend it.,4
287763,Love love love this Kimono! I thought it would be really cheap feeling and fall apart and be small since it wasn't that expensive but it was everything but that! I use it as a photography prop now for my maternity sessions. (Picture was taken by another photographer friend while I was also modeling for maternity ) Goes great with a lace dress!,5
240636,"Great ring! It is shiny and it doesn't scratch or tarnish. The color is bright and silver, NOT the gunmetal coloring like traditional Tungsten rings.  The only downside is that it has a very high dome, so if you want something flatter, this may not work for you. It bugged my finger (I put it on my middle finger) because of the dome, but I got used to it after a while. If you want something classy, simple and sturdy, this is the ring to get.",4
875820,"Looks lovely on my 3yo daughter. The fabric is soft and light, and the ruching at the neck and back gives it a great shape.  When I got it the design seemed cracked and kind of offset, like a printing error, but after washing it seems to have tightened up a bit and now looks great!",5
281755,"The set is cute and fits my son just fine... However after two weeks the slippers have fallen apart (think shoes that can talk, they're THAT bad!). I would expect this after months of wear and tear, but only wearing them in the morning and just before bed (and for just two weeks), is unacceptable.",3
234128,"It was too small and I did not care for the fabric used. I have an hour-glass figure like model shown, the fabric appears to be spandex/stretchy however, I can't even get the material to stretch over my rear. Would have sent it back if it wasn't so petty. It gets one star and that's only due to the fact I don't know if this comment will show without. *side eye*",1
739713,These boots are warm and fuzzy inside. They feel lightweight-great for toddlers! My boys liked them but they run small. I ordered these boots a size up and they are very snug fitting with regular cotton socks! My twins like them anyway and want to wear then all day long! I hope they fit through february....,3
230135,"At first glance my impression was this looks a lot classier in the photo.  In actuality the pieces have a kind of distressed look to them; not as clean and shiny like in the photo.  It may pass as ""vintage"" if that's the style you're looking for. However, once worn I got many compliments on it and it did show up quite beautifully on my personal photos.",4
669066,This dress is so nice for the price! It is exactly what we were looking for. It fit great. We ordered a size to big so we will taking it in a little but really overall we are very pleased. Our seller was super fast on shipping! Got it in just less than a week.,5
37333,"I really liked this bag, but I figured a bit smaller (like to take it to the gym) is really big to make short trips. It is versatile because it may take several forms, is more comfortable as a backpack.
The color is equal to the picture and comes in a nice bag where you can save travel cosmetics.",5
86164,I am quite happy with these. My girlfriend really liked them. I attached a few pics so you can see how they look on someone. The color and sparkle is very nice. The screw on backs should keep them in place. You can put a dab of nail polish on the shaft before tightening it to give it extra hold.,5
289879,My friend is an artist and she loves quirky socks.  Yesterday was her birthday and these were delivered on her birthday!  The socks are bright and beautiful.  They do take a while to ship.  But they are so worth the wait.  You will not find a better deal.  And I don't know if we lucked out but hers came with a bonus pair!  A jockey riding a horse.  So cute!!,5
4050,"my wife got this as a last-minute costume for a 20s party (gotta love prime) and it looked great. she said it was a tad big and while it didn't billow it definitely wasn't form fitting so if that's what you're looking for, go a size down. it wasn't shipped in the greatest container but there weren't any noticeable imperfections. my wife has actually worn this to other functions so if you get the right size, it's a great item. she was worried it would be really uncomfortable but she said it wasn't scratchy at all.",3
7627,"Love these pants perfect amount of pockets for all my things (tools, Cell phone, etc.). Love the color and the durable feel. They are lighter weight then some of my other pairs but I prefer this. I highly recommend these to anyone who wants the great quality products that Carhartt makes.",5
187901,Love them!  Every now and then I get really lucky.  I love these scarves and they are perfect for me.  I can use them with so many outfits or with my jeans...dress up or dress down.  Really nice and I got so many for such an excellent price.  I am humming about my luck!,5
408154,"I was looking for a brooch to match a navy blue suit.  I had seen something but it was very pricy.  Then I stumbled onto this one.  I was very hesitant to purchase the brooch without actually touching or seeing it. But the picture seemed nice and the price was right.  To my surprise, it arrived very quickly and I couldn't have been happier.  The brooch is very sturdy and seems to be made very well.",5
177005,"I enjoy the ring. It came earlier than expected. I question it's composition though. I wondered how it could have been offered so cheaply if it was stainless steel as the advertisement said. When it arrived I was even more concerned, it felt way too light and is way too easy to bend. Size must be for YOUNG kids, to fit me the B is over the F. I will keep it though. I like it. I'm a whovian I guess.",4
177758,"Yay, a great buy on a beautiful addition to my collection.  Light as air, I use it as an accessory/scarf when a touch of blush is what I'm looking for, and as a wrap when a fan or AC stirs up the air around me more than I like to feel. This is so light I hardly feel it on, but you will be surprised at how effective it is. It is very generously sized, leaving many options open for styling. Have fun with it!",5
861301,I bought this based off the reviews. It fits terrible! I bought a large when I normally wear a small or medium. This doesn't cover my boobs at all! I wear a size 6 and cup size 34 D. The bottom is extremely baggy and the top isn't big enough to cover my chest. The fabric is thicker and the collar is a secure closure. The fit is so awkward. It will cost more to return so I'm keeping it. If you're  c cup or smaller this may look decent.,2
668602,The design on them is half shiny and the other half is brushed. So easy to wear and very light yet made well. I don't care for those long dangling earrings so these are perfect length. Jody Coyote's earrings are so nicely made and I get compliments every time I wear a pair.,5
358686,"I bought these because my baby's fingernails were totally unmanageable and i wanted to keep her from constantly scratching her face.  They have also worked well to keep her hands warm during winter (we live in AZ so we are not talking snow or anything).

I gave them 4 stars because the reversible flap makes the gloves a little stiff to the baby can't use her hands that much while she is wearing them.",4
553910,Completely disappointed. Nothing like the picture. Its like felt material with a zipper thrown on it. Normally love everything i order but this shouldn't even be sold as its just terrible. Was so excited as the pictured jacket was so cute! I guess that's what happens when you buy something odf amazon now. I would give 0 stars if possible.,1
103888,Anyone who is looking for a nice quality garter that has a vintage feel should really get this set. The set is super comfortable and very nicely made (I love the fact that it has a little blue bow on the inside of the fancier garter) and it's nice that they offer to make it to your size specifications. It came wrapped in tissue paper with a nice note and is definitely something worth keeping through out your life. I would definitely buy from them again!,5
614566,These earrings are amazing. I am 30 years old and for the past 20 I haven't been able to wear anything but gold or platinum. In the past my ears have swollen immediately after putting other types of earrings on. A friend suggested I try surgical steel so I tried these out. I wore them for 10 hours today and they didn't cause a reaction!!!,5
729949,"I will not buy from this seller again. I originally did not think that this purse was worth the price of $94 but I purchased it anyway. Upon arrival it wasn't the quality that I wanted, just as I thought. I gave it to my cousin. The price tag attached to it read, ""$79.50. As I suspected, not worth the price that I paid. I overpaid by $14.50. Don't buy from this seller, they will cheat you out of your money!",1
265734,LOVE these glasses!  Have them stashed all over the house.  This is the second time I have ordered them (my dog chewed up 2 of the first set I ordered).  Great value for a quality product.  They don't fall apart and lose screws like others do.,5
340878,"I ordered to wear under dress pants at work as a warmer option to pantyhose - these are perfect. Do note than they run larger than I expected. I am usually a size 7 and these are not at all restricting like many one size items can be. This is great if you are larger, but does show many gatherings of fabric - particularly around knees and ankles, that may not be desired if not wearing as an under garment. They are thinner than usual leggings - but again, that was my intention.",5
435164,I was disappointed because it did not fit true to size.  I am a size 8 and wear a medium shirt.  I purchased a medium and fit more like a small.  I really liked the style of the shirt but since it came from the UK I was not going to pay to ship it back and then pay shipping again to get a larger size.  It ended up fitting  my 13 yr old daughter ( a little loose) who normally wears an adult XS.,3
2742,"Do not be fooled by the ""One Size Fits Most."" It doesn't. I'm a very petite 5'2"" with a 29-30"" inseam. My size varies between a 0 and a 4 depending on who designes an outfit. I got these on okay, but I cannot imagine how anyone with longer legs or a larger girth would ever be able to get these up all the way without turning them into thigh-highs!",3
203781,Really cute fits perfect shipping came really  fast will order again I ordered large an I wear a large so it runs true to size it also stretches I was kind of skeptical because of reviews about the top but as U can see the top is not to small and I have small breast,5
156966,"This travel wallet is a great design!!! It doesn't have a huge capacity, but it gets the job done. It will hold approximately 6 cards. The construction is much more sturdy than that of similar products I've seen online. It's all stainless steel construction, even the hinge and the clasp. The size is perfect, not too big, but not too small either. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to neatly and securely carry their necessary credit/ID cards.",5
227010,"Great!! I love Amazon, and I shop on it frequently! So I know how things work. I ordered these cause I've just always wanted thigh high socks!! There cute, fit great! Would highly recommend these if this is what your looking for! Cute unexpected design that I do not mind having! :) over all great socks! They were delivered to me 3 days late but it was completely the post offices fault! Not amazons! I also have very thick thigh and they don't squeeze me at all. Like I almost was afraid they would do!",5
392745,"I purchased this to put my makeup in on the go & I carry it with me every day in every bag that I use, it is a nice color,  the material is great it's easy to clean if you spill anything on it. It is easy to zip or unzip, it's great for any bag, you can put anything in it - not just for makeup.",5
154005,"Good wallet. I have a lot of cards to carry around (not just credit cards), and this does a good job of keeping them secure into 4 discrete sleeves. However, I have more than this wallet can easily carry in those 4 slots, so I put them into the large pocket. the problem is that they can sort of move around a bit. It would have been nice to have a couple larger card sleeves into each side of the primary pocket for carrying other cards. Not so tight, but enough room to easily put business cards, etc.",4
399188,"I bought this bag about 2 years ago and I was very pleased with it. It was a great purse. However, after a while the straps broke (the hole got bigger and the little metal ""ball"" that held the strap could not stay in anymore).
I really loved this bag and I may try to find another one like it.",4
191018,"Ordered these for my daughter and her friend for Easter & they loved them. Got the necklace too. Pic is a little deceiving, the ""diamond"" drop is actually kind of large like the size of a penny or so. I thought they would be a little smaller but they loved them so it was fine.",5
768346,"Omg! I love this sweatshirt! It's so comfy and soft and it's in perfect condition! Exactly like it is in the picture! I'm usually a small but I got a medium! Thank you SOOO much! I love how it says ""we are one"" on the back so it's not as hard to pick just one member!! I've been looking everywhere for a sweatshirt like this! Shipping was very fast too! I ordered this December 30th and got it yesterday when it was suppose to come in Feb 8th!",5
135348,"These were a little larger than other shoes of the same size.  It does not seem like the shoe industry can get it together on what is supposed to be what size in toddler shoes, no matter how many charts you print out and measure.  Overall, my son loved his new ""choos"", and they have worn well for the action a 2-1/2 year old boy can give.",4
58706,The perfect bag to bring to the beach/pool/lake/picnic .  A wide color selection and personalization with fobbz makes the bag unique as well.  The flat bottom on the bag and sturdy handles make the bag user friendly.  Also makes a great diaper bag or even a picnic basket -  Is easy to clean however you use the bag!  Buy one in several colors/sizes.  You will not be sorry.,5
833606,Poor quality. The quality of the fabric made this dress was very uncomfortable. It was stiff and didn't fit well in the bust/chest area. Only good thing about the dress was the length as it was longer than most other dresses like this. I am 6' tall and it was long enough for me if I wore flats.,2
709655,"I really like the colors but not a fan of the fit. It is way too tight for a large. AI ordered up according to a few reviews, didn't really help. As soon as I put this on the seams on the bottoms ripped a bit. If I do order another suit I'll for sure order two sizes up.",3
462230,It runs a bit big so I would recommend one size below your normal to get that perfect fit. If you have good hips this dress is perfect. It is also a bit long but can be altered to the perfect length. I love this dress and would reccomd this as a good buy.,3
867091,"Returned immediately. As soon as I took them out of the package I could see that they were already tarnished. They are also very light and cheap feeling.

UPDATE: Seller offered to replace item but I had already ordered something else. Then offered to pick something from the store that was similar in price to try for free. I chose the Black Leather Cord Necklaces and the quality is great! Stand up seller and would buy from again if there is anything I need!",3
635545,"Terrible fit, Extremely too large. Fits like three sizes bigger than you ordered. I wear a 4x but wanted to wear a heavy sweater underneath it,so ordered one size larger. Well I could have gotten a 2x and had enough room. It is that much too large.  I will find someone to give it to someday.",1
236793,If you are familiar with Skechers brand and its memory foam this shoe is not far-fetched from the typical Skechers shoe. Nothing new that stood out from the 5 other pair of memory foam shoes I have. They eventually wear out after a month of constant wear down. RETURNING-NOTHING SPECTACULAR HERE FOLKS! it's a pair of skechers memory foam shoes with a WATER RESISTANT attachment feature.,3
57265,"Extremely happy with this purchase.  I use it all the time.  I leave my big wallet in my big purse and take this with me when I do not want to carry my big purse and wallet.  Fits easily into your pocket with a couple of keys and is all you need.  My only complaint is that sometimes it is hard to get a credit card out, but it is no big thing.",5
206926,"These run a bit big for their size, but are SO cute! The knotted hats are especially adorable. I love that these are so easy to put on and off; I often will pull them up through the neck since it's sewn to open up rather than trying to go over baby's head. They are easy and cute!",5
762770,"Short on my daughter. Asian sizing so order up a size or two. If you're looking for something close to knee length, you should be at least 4'8' in height. My daughter is 5'2 and it's cute but not appropriate for church so she'd pr have to wear it with leggings to school or something less formal",4
621226,"Pretty, slightly sheer so will wear it over a swimsuit, and at 5'10"" it only hits at top of my ankle where I would prefer floor length. There are adjustable straps in case you would like it shorter. I would rate it a bit overpriced for what it is. And arrives scrunched up and very wrinkled in a tiny bag.",3
301118,"My husband bought me the Vera large wallet (like a wristlet) for Christmas, but it doesn't come with a strap. I bought this lanyard to match. If you open the wallet all the way, you can thread the lanyard through the back. I moved the ring to the other end. and tied one knot in it, so it wasn't as long. EVERYONE comments how great my wallet / wristlet is. They all say, I've never seen one with the strap.... lol. I'm creative!",5
272430,"The product is made of very good material, my son used it and today we inherit it to a nephew and it is in a very good state of preservation, the colors are still alive, the material does not produce itching or shrinkage with the washing, although it must be try to wash it separately and in delicate cycle.",4
182317,"These are soft and cozy to wear. They do separate your toes quite a bit though. If you're not used to that, it will take some getting used to. I have Morton's Neuroma in both feet and these socks have helped me a lot! They really separate your toes and relieve the pressure of the damaged nerves between your toes.",5
720078,"This dress looks NOTHING like the picture. It fits like a box, and is made out of cheap material. I requested a refund and because it's via ""China Post"", I was denied and offered 15% off instead, along with a recommendation of trying to sell it off to someone else. If you want real clothes and decent customer service, stay far away from this seller!",1
665488,This bracelet turned out to be a nice bracelet. I love the material rope they use and the hearts connected are with great material as well. This is a smaller size bracelet though so keep that in mind when you are buying one of these. (I did receive this product at a discounted rate to leave a honest review).,5
413968,"I gave this to my roommate for Christmas this past year. She's always remarked how she wanted one, so this year, I made sure to get it for her. The original one she had on her wish list  was no longer available, but I saw this and she loves the color blue.

It was a total hit! She loves it! It's got lots of pockets and a full zipper across the top, plus a handle that's long enough she can put it across her body! I kinda want one for me, now!",5
709878,"I bought this dress for daughters pageant. When the dress arrived, It was very large all over and the length was too long. I emailed custom sizing. The beading was not as pictured in the ad. Some of the stones were missing from the back as well. It was delivered 2 weeks early which exceeded my expectation. Could not send it back because of a short time frame and my daughter was in love with the ad picture.
",1
456675,I was so excited to get these labels and used them on my child's shoes and boots right away. I followed the instructions but the labels started moving around in the shoes on the very first day. The labels were also very easy to come off. I actually had better luck in the past using the Avery no-iron clothes labels when in a pinch for a solution to label shoes on their inside.,1
871130,Should have sent them back. They fit okay but were sewn together with white thread on blue and black print!(?) The thread shows where the waistband meets the pants and totally visible on the outside of the hems. Disgusting. Ridiculous. Not even understandable for the price I paid. Why? Black would have worked just great? White looks cheap and ignorant. Even a beginning seamstress knows to match the thread color to the fabric.,1
455528,"I'm not sure why the first reviewer gave this jacket such a bad review (other than the seam, which is a quality issue and it could be replaced).  While I haven't had any issues with seams ripping.  I really like this jacket, it is lightweight and not too heavy like some windbreakers (perfect for muggy Seattle weather as I like to be dry, not sweaty). The design is an eye-catcher and conversation starter, and I received more than a couple of compliments on the jacket.",5
598978,This is the 5th baby swimsuit I have purchased. Our twin girls have spent the last 3 summers wearing these. Now their baby brother will have one too. Living in Arizona we've made up for the cost of the suits in money saved on sunscreen. I especially loved the bottom zipper feature when we were potty training last year. My only complaint was that the yellow color was a bit awkwardly sheer/ see-through. But I exchanged it for one of the darker colors and no problem.,5
625521,I like them a lot. I bought them to wear with my wedding gown because we are having a garden wedding. They are very nice but they have no support what so ever. I have bad knees so I can only wear them for a little while. They seem to be well made and are exactly as pictured.,4
333956,"This is  a great jacket especially for the price. I've been wearing it in this negative degree weather and it keeps me toasty warm! I love the fur and coat color! My mom just ordered the same one in black because she loved mine so much! For reference: I'm almost 5'6"" and usually wear size 4 jeans and medium shirts.",5
860876,I ordered an XL accidentally but glad I did because it fits very nicely except the bottoms are big but I'm not planning on wearing the bottoms anyway. I bought boy short bottoms and love how they look with the top. I'm 51 years old and have a tummy issue after menopause so I love that it hides it nicely!,5
58387,"i am using them as liners for my wool socks when i hike, and even as additional warmth in inclement weather (which we are having now). for those purposes, they are are awesome. they do dry quickly and can be hand washed. i accidentally ran them through my washing machine, and they are fine. i intend to buy more.",4
791615,"Very cute, very comfortable, HOWEVER it's VERY thin, and the biggest issue is ... it's extremely cheaply made. Seams ripped before I even wore it ... I sewed it - washed it - then found more ripped seams. It's okay to wear at home but honestly you should probably save your money and spend a bit more for something else that's better.",2
851064,"I got this in pink. It came quicker than expected about a week. The tracking information is all wrong. I am 110 lbs and slim built. I got a small size.

It fit fine but unfortunately the light colour shows up everything as the material is so thin. Sigh.

The make and design though is so beautiful. Get a darker colour so that your underwear Etc is not visible.",3
32431,The socks itself are good but the warmer goes on the top of your food and it burned my foot after the first wear and I work outdoors so I normally get the one that sticks in your shoe with the adhesive I am just going to stick with that because I never got injured with that,2
669924,"This is a beautiful dress for the price. I have to return it because even if the back is as tight as it will go the dress is still way too big on me and the detachable strap is kind of cheap looking and falls off. I am 5'6"" 170lbs and a 34D. The measurements indicated that i needed a XL, I would return for a smaller size but i don't have time before the wedding.",4
223307,"These hats are not completely lined inside and therefore not as warm as they look-- warm but not as warm as they appear to be in photos. Also, they are cheaply made and the white fuzzy lining comes out easily. Outside of that, they look ADORABLE on, are great for photos, hold up in the wash (do not put in dryer), and fit the heads of my 6 month old, as well as my 2 year old.",4
817224,"I got a L and normally where anywhere from a 10-14 in pants, 36dd bust. Top and bottoms are just a tiny bit snug, but overall its an awesome suit. Feels really well made, and the ladies feel secure on top. The only thing that's a little weird is the crotch area is just a couple cm's too wide, it just feels like there's extra fabric down there...I don't think its noticeable, but it feels a little weird.",4
776518,"I have always loved Vera Bradley! I have never owned one of these style bags before though, so so was a little iffy on if I would like it or not. But I absolutely love it! My favorite part is that the inside is lined with plastic so that if any of my makeup products leak, it doesnt damage the inside of the bag.",5
346494,"Okay, so I read the reviews and just about everyone said good things so I did it.  Well, mine didn't work at all!  Maybe there was a problem with amount of ""stuff"" they put on the fingertips or what, but I took these on a trip to Europe where it is mighty cold and I had to walk around with one glove off so that I could take pictures.  I was very disappointed and I guess I should have tried them out before I left.",1
73644,"I saw another review that this costume runs small. I am only 5'2"" tall and I typically wear a womens medium, so I decided to order a large. The costume barely covers my backside! I will keep it since I bought a matching print mens caveman costume for my husband, but I will need to wear black leggings with this costume in order to keep everything covered.",2
495215,"I love these capris! I wear them for hot yoga as well as running and around the house. I have them in xs and small sizes and I wear both but the xs fits a little better. I am 5'4"" 120 lbs. The material is stretchy and soft. Very comfortable. I take off one star because they are pretty thick which can get hot.",4
686747,"To all you Walking Dead fans, this is a must have. As a Daryl Dixon lover I had to order this. I've gotten many comments out and about, and it's just so fun! Perfect to go out and about doing ""stuff"" and ""things"". It does fade a bit after a few washes, but is great for the price!!!",5
383324,"When i first got this product,  i could not figure out how to put it on. I looked crazy. Once i figured it out,  i really loved the color and how it felt on me. It felt so soft and comfortable.  Once i figured it out,  it is easy to put on and take off. It is a nice top to go out on a date or go to the club.
I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.",5
410791,"I wanted a backpack that would go with my professional appearance.  Found it, and it isn't just pretty.  It is very durable, and comes in handy.  When it gets in the rain, it gets raised bumps in the leather, but they go away after a few hours.  No biggie.  Great briefcase by Samsonite.  Wonderful value for the price.  It was inexpensive, but the product is definitely not cheap!",5
750840,"I would've loved to send my 6 children to Harvard, but this watch was just a must have! Unfortunately, I had to also sell all 4 of my limbs, and part of my youngest son's cerebral but let me tell you, this watch looks absolutely FANTASTIC on top of the second mortgage I took out on the house. Not gonna lie, I'm a little hungry though. Haven't been able to eat for 8 months.",5
229300,"The pedals have the clip in on both sides, which makes it real EAZY to get going, wasn't expecting that so a real bonus. The shoes are mostly plastic and will not last long, but good enough for the price paid.

Make sure to setup the spring tension on the pedals proper, as shipped they are all over the place. For that lack of QC I had to subtract one star.",4
13478,"I ordered these Powerstep Pinnacle insoles for arch support.  They arrived quickly.  I ripped out the insoles of a pair of walking shoes, then easily slipped the Powerstep insoles in place.  They work like a charm providing all day comfort when previously my feet would start barking after a couple hours.  I will order these for every pair of shoes which need them.  Why mess around with foot pain?",5
351685,I really wanted to like the yoga pants (leggings) but I don't like how they fit. I ordered a size up since yoga pants seem to fit tighter. I should have ordered 2 sizes up. I like the fabric and I think I would like the look of them if they fit correctly. Bummed.,3
147116,"I got this to add a little something to my intimacy with my husband of 21 years. I LOVE IT! Comfortable, fits very well. I'm a short person and small framed. I have a hard time finding anything online that fits right. I ordered the small thinking adjustment may be necessary. Nothing had to be altered. I am telling my friends about it. Would recommend it to anyone.",5
328609,"This is my 2nd time purchasing this item. 1st one began pilling and the elastic began to poke thru after about a year, but for the price, this is not an issue. I get sooooooo many compliments every time I wear this. Everyone always asks me when they can get one. Also note, this item arrives earlier than expected.",5
474673,"I bought this for my mom, who wears a size 14. She can't quite bring the front all the way together, but it does fit in the shoulders. The brown is a nice and natural color. It was shedding a little when it arrived, not sure how it's holding up. It also left a strange waxy film on my fingers, but doesn't smell. Honestly, despite all this, it's a nice shawl for the price. I have other fur, and this looks just as nice as some of my other peices.",4
556329,"I'm 6""0 185 and I ordered the xxl

1. This jacket is fire engine red, not dark red
2. The leather is basically plastic but you have to expect that from a $35 jacket
3. The torso fit but the sleeves were insanely small.
4. It looks like the thriller jacket, which is sweet, just the quality and fit are terrible.",2
590095,"LOVE these, but not for the way they fit. They're kind of boxy; there's extra fabric at the heel. But I love them Soft, cozy and adorable. Oh also, they have those little rubbery grips on the bottom, like yoga socks. I don't really like those, but I don't mind them much either.",5
487512,"I searched for ""wool"" when I was looking for hats and this one is listed as being made of ""knitting wool"" which is either a bad translation or a complete LIE because its acrylic.  Not surprised about this because the price was really too cheap to be wool.  Its ok.  I'll wear it anyway but its not my new favorite hat.  Fits a little small, wish it was a little bigger.",3
485005,"Super cute, my son has a collection of different drivers caps--but this one has quickly become my new favorite. He's been wearing it almost a year now and it's held up wonderful so far. Plus it is just super cool and cute. People always ask me where I get all his vintage stye hats, and this one is no different, it's a hit!",5
579586,"I got a large and it fit great! Granted I'm actually a size Medium in the US and I had to get a large, but it fit and lays comfortable and feels great. its a bit think, so you can kinda see the bra underneath, but I've worn it several times and will continue to wear it. I just wish there were other prints in this item.",4
473800,"I have not worn this out-and-about yet, but when I tried it on, my two thoughts were 1) It's a bit small and 2) the lace doesn't seem very sturdy. I am 5'9"" and 125lbs, and cami sizes can be tricky to guess at. I ordered a small, and it fit, but was very form-fitting. I prefer it a little looser. For this reason, I would probably order a large next time. Not a bad purchase, just wish I had ordered a larger size. This will work for wearing under T-shirts, though.",3
37106,"Simply awesome deal!  Nice looking variety of ties.  There are two size of skinny ties which I wasn't able to choose.  To pick your colors, select the 10 colors you want, and send a note to the seller after completing the order.  That part wasn't obvious.  Got the colors I wanted, ties look great!  I'm a happy customer.  Highly recommended!",5
442160,"I really like the fabric, thin and light, perfect for summer nights. My daughter really liked the small colorful birds on this night shirt. She keeps pointing at the birds and telling their colors out loud.
She is a bit tiny, 25 lbs at 2 years 4 months, for her this shirt fits snug around the arms and neck. But we both love this PJ so much, I am going to order this in a bigger size.",5
850634,"Very well made. Not a single dud in the bunch.
I made them into a pair of earrings for Autism Awareness month in April. I work as a sign language interpreter in an elementary school setting and the children loved them and I was able to help teach them and spread the word of Autism Awareness! I plan to make more jewelry projects and give them as gifts to my colleagues to continue the support for Autism Awareness!",5
451510,"The rose gold color is like in the picture, the cross is small but well made, they feel a little heave.  But for me, this earrings were very difficult to put on, I had a hard time trying to do it and I finally quit. maybe they are made for children.",3

I had the ring for a few months and because of overestimating my ring size, lost it.  I just ordered another and I can't wait to wear it again.",5
553054,I got these for my sister for Christmas. They are absolutely beautiful. She uses a rubber ring to keep them from slipping out of her ears which honestly I'd recommend  doing if anyone else plans to buy them they are too pretty and falling from your ears to the ground will shatter them.,5
311154,"I'm not a hat person, but I needed something to keep my head warm without overheating, that also looked stylish. This hat definitely fits the bill. It's perfectly slouchy but doesn't fall off my head. It's lined with warm fabric that keeps me warm but doesn't make me sweat, and it looks great, too. My new favorite winter accessory!",5
259207,"It feels like a lot of love went into this bag. It's just perfect, so rustic and chic. It's like Indiana Jones meets Audrey Hepburn cool. It's boxy, which I like, but also soft and supple and holds a lot more than you think it will. It's got a distinct leather smell that I think is wonderful and will ultimately fade if you don't like it. Quick delivery and cute little leather journal included. Very pleased with this purchase!",5
47155,"This visor was just as advertised.  It was beautiful and sturdy.  It arrived on time and in great shape.  However, it was too small.  I adjusted as full as possible and it still had too much pressure on my head.  I do not have a large head and I have very short hair.  Perhaps there should be a full size visor.  I got a full refund without any incident.",4
257733,The onesie itself is very soft and feels pretty luxurious but it wasn't as baggy as I expected. The butt zipper part is also more apparent than I would have liked it to be but overall pretty satisfied with the product. No outstanding damage upon arrival and came with a nice note :),4
359442,"This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. Wallet is perfect for on the go things. If you don't want to hall your whole wallet, you can take what you need and go. Fits around my iPhone. Good quality material. Inside was striped white and red, which is a cute touch. It's a little smaller than I thought it would be but its compact size might be a good selling point for some. Thinking about using it on vacation for the beach. Also, it came with a cute crab sticker.",5
633350,"Design is really cute but it rides up in between my thighs when walking. If you don't have a thigh gap, expect this to ride up in between your legs. I have to constantly pull it back down when wearing it under a dress. I wanted something to reduce static under my flowy work dresses but I got tired of having to readjust these shorts. These are now my lounge shorts.",3
794423,This skirt is nothing at all like the picture it was advertised under nor is it the same shade of green. The skirt is a midi length skirt and  not the maxi as shown. It came with a cheap looking white belt. I was hoping to wear it for an evening event but the skirt isn't even suitable to wear grocery shopping.  I was terribly dissappointed when I received my order.  I definetly wouldn't recommend it to anyone.,1
816779,"I really like this dress but my only hesitation is the material is kind of itchy and heavy. It looks great on, it is form fitting but flattering. It fits just above my knees. I got a medium and it fits perfect. I am 5'2 and 130 lbs. For the price I was really happy!",4
491450,"I love theses! They have clean lines and fit me perfecty. I try to grab as many as I can when I find them for a price less expensive than their companys website. They do tend to stretch a little during the course of a day, so I buy a size smaller.",5
427884,"I bought this hat for my grandmother because she needs protection from the sun when she in her garden, or at the beach, but she has a very small head and has a hard time finding ""adult"" hats that fit her, and most kids hats are too childish for her.  This was the perfect combination of small size without being too childish for her to wear.  She loves it!",5
123606,"This is a nice shirt, but I wish they had more colors. The two colors offered here aren't that appealing... I'm usually an XL or XXL; this was a little small compared to other XXL shirts so I would make sure to order the next larger size if you are in between sizes. Overall, a good shirt, good message and good price!",4
103996,"It is, indeed, a beautiful ring.  Packaged well, and received when expected.  The only reason I rated it with 4 stars, is due to the fact that I ordered a size 8, and it is a 7 3/4.  I have Arthritis, so it is hard to get over my knuckle.  I have to use soap and water, to get it off, also.  Other than that, I really like it.",4
533946,"I bought this cute T for my 24 yr old daughter for Christmas who is a big ""Friends"" fan and she LOVED it! I also bought her a matching coffee mug and when she opened her gift her eyes lit up like she was 6 yrs old again. She said she couldn't wait to put it on and watch ""Friends"" while she enjoyed her favorite coffee. She called the next day, ""Guess what I'm doing."" You guess it!  It was obviously her favorite gift, so I would highly recommend it for any ""Friends"" fans!",5
638484,So perfect! I was looking for a crochet crop top that was still relatively long. I bought this on a whim and was really worried about the quality and fit. Quality is amazing for the price and the fit was flawless! I'm a size 32DDD chest so I ordered a size medium; I also choose to wear this without a bra and due to the slight padding/lining in the top it worked out great! Perfect top for the summer time; i couldn't be more pleased!,5
501053,"Super comfortable. I read other reviews saying they came small so I ordered an XL. I normally would wear between M and L but I wanted to make sure they were a good fit. They come as I would expect a normal XL and not one that was small to size. However I am still extremely satisfied because the material is nice and they are super comfortable. With the waist being elastic, the bigger size was not a problem for me. I might order them again. Great price.",5

I've bought several pairs in various styles/colors and all are excellent. (I've moved away from cotton underpants to this matterial. Feels great while securing the ""boys"" comfortably)",5

The fabric is extremely soft & you just want to feel of it! It looks amazing on my daughter. My loss her gain...she looks like a Barbie in it!",4
220191,I love the design and the color beige design is as seen in the picture!! The only reason I'm giving four stars is because the little nose of the rabbit came with a defect the good thing is that I was able to fix it.  Other than that is very cute!,4

She was getting 2 little sisters and they were to find their big sister by the matching socks they were wearing. Corey yes I know & I would have rather taped on dollar bills to their feet but this is how it goes. Anyway they loved the memory.,5

They are great quality and design. Just very, very wide and a little too long. Too bad as we really wanted the Sport version for our kids. We ordered 2 pairs in different colors and sizes for both kids. This issue was with both pairs.",2
279767,"I give it a two because it is very cute. Also because I'm 5'11"" and the height was too short cause most women are not my height. But it fit in a very awkward way even taking the height factor out. I'll never be able to wear it in public. Overall I regret the purchase!",2
523429,"I am a big guy and sometimes shirts that are listed as a 2XL don't fit right, but this shirt was great even after two washes. The textured graphics look tremendous and feel great. I wore this in the park the other day and had a person tell me that they liked the shirt!",5

I live in an apartment with hardwood floors and they are loud when walking around, I would have preferred a softer sole. I wear a size 7 and these fit perfectly. I often have a problem with heel slipping off or shoe being too wide but these fit great, so they may be too narrow for a wider foot.  Color is exactly as shown in picture. They are made well and keep feet warm.",4

813287,"I normally wear a US 12 or 14, but based on all the reviews, I ordered an XL, and it was HUGE.  Quality seemed okay, but the high waisted bottoms came up to a couple of inches under my bust, so it looked like I was wearing some kind of weird maternity swimsuit.  Maybe it's my body type, but this just didn't work for me at all.",2

870761,"Both somewhat large and somewhat small at the same time. Strangely tight in the arms and wide at the waist. The dress is also very see-through. It worked well enough and you can put layers over or under the skirt. I guess for the price it's okay, but I was still a little disappointed.",3
157491,"The leggings would be nice if I could get out the petroleum smell,, which is VERY strong.  Washed them several times and still can't get that  smell out!  I'm a large, so bought a large and x-large and they were tight, so bought the 3x which should have been loose on me, but are still somewhat snug.
As for the seller, they are very quick.  I received my pants within 48 hrs of ordering.  I did not contact them about the smell, though.",3

It clips closed with a lobster clip.  This is a great gift that any MOM would love.  I get an early mother's day present for myself.  The pendant is about the size of a nickel.

I actually threw it away, was so cheaply made and all wrinkled covered in fur I would be ashamed to give it to anyone. Will never order from this company again, I usually wear a medium, it said that the coat runs small so I ordered an extra large could not even get both arms in it. Very, very UNSATISFIED.",1
208264,"Not really like the picture, shape looks more like a bag than a dress, the length is also not acceptable as a dress. The top received even though not like the picture is still cute enough that I will wear it at some point, probably more of a beach cover than anything.",2
659765,"This shirt doesn't tie the way it looks in the picture the side pieces gap a lot and it looks bad.  I tried to return it and got the run around.  So I still have it, but it doesnt look as good as the photo and these weird things on the front shoulders make awful looking pouches and the neck is not finished.",1
808628,"Whole dress must be fresh dyed, stained two other black dresses to now look navy. Definitely wash this alone! There are no wash instructions included. I did cold water and now I have a lovely dress for a child. Other than that the material does require you to iron it as the fold near the bust does not stay flat unless this is done. In retrospect I wish I had not bought this dress, cute in pictures however does not stay like this at all.",1
870285,"The blouse is good but was tight on the bust. Can not risk keeping it due to the doubt it might shrink after wash. The stichingbin the front is uneven. One side is longer than the other. My size is U.S L-XL and the fit will be good for ladies with smaller breast.
I am returning it but not because of its quality.",4

The alloy may bend if caught in a shirt while changing, but easily placed back into place. It did discolor a little, but nothing concerning. I would buy it again! I love the flower design and get compliments on it. Don't forget to buy a chain!",5

I am still wearing them. The seller refunded my purchase after seeing an image of the rip, they were very helpful. The pants themselves are cute and comfortable, but since they ripped, and not on the seam either, I can only wear them at home. I have a 49in waist, 3x fits very comfy, does not dig into belly or create fat rolls :)",3
415608,"Actually this shirt is a lot more colourfull than it shows in the picture. The stripe consists of 5 or 6 different colours: from khaki and green to mustard. Plus I think it runs a bit wide, but maybe it's supposed to be ""oversized"", I don't know (since the length was OK).",3

37244,"this hat is adorable, and the brim is wide enough to give good protection (i do have to move it around a little depending on how the sun is hitting my baby's face, but not a big deal). the material is a good thickness so that i can flip up the brim if my baby wants to look around.",5

When you take them out of the package the fake jean lines and print looks very cheesy.  But when you wear them, they look cute.  They look exactly like what they are...  Jeggings.  I wear a longer shirt to cover the top of them though, b/c the fake pockets look kind of ridiculous.",4
450826,"The product did not meet my expectations.  In order to return the item, I would have had to ship it to China, which would have been cost-prohibitive.  The product description states that it was for ""girls""; however, the hats were clearly sized for adults. In addition, the hats were packaged in such a way that the hates were mis-shapened.",1
481195,"beautiful, warm and will probably show up as a very generous scarf for the winter, until spring evenings return. Every bit as pretty and graceful as the picture. Not the top of the line fabric, but the price is certainly right! Also, not huge, but big enough to be a good-looking wrap.",4

572284,"These cargo pants are awesome for the price.  Rich green in color with numerous metal-hardware, snap pockets.  The material is difficult to describe, but it has no ""give"", so pay close attention to ALL the measurements (which I did not, so they did not fit me).  The material is not thin, nor is it thick, so it's perfect for cool summer nights, fall or spring.  LOVE the details... such as ties at the leg bottoms for a cute tied look.  If my body type would fit, I would order again.",5
154208,"I wear these shoes every day to work. Though the side material is much like a sweater and will pill up just the same, with a little care these are great shoes. I did replace the insole with my typical cheapie no brand name insert, and have had no issues out of these shoes. They aren't particularly warm for winter, and I did double up on my socks, but they are comfortable, and fit as I thought they would, no rubbing, no aches, nothing.",4
699207,Had originally purchased this jacket in Costco but  they haven't had it back in stock for a year so I was thrilled to find it online. It came quickly it was exactly the same one that I had loved from Costco and the quality was unchanged.  The nice thing about this jacket is it works like a sweater or it will get you through the 40 days of winter without a bulky winter coat. Highly recommended.,5
572115,"Beautiful coat. I really wanted the amethyst color but it was out of stock, so I decided to try this one. I am really happy with it! It's a really saturated, dark red-- it's pictured pretty accurately. I would echo some of the other comments in that it feels substantial and well made. I love how it fits! I would recommend it.",5
584609,"I really like that this belt is functional and comfortable. The belt buckle is really cool and works with ease. It also provides that slight extra waist support I need , with the way most jeans fit me. I was hesitant to pay this price for a non leather belt , but it has quickly become my favorite belt.",4
34429,"This is a beautiful piece and it is exactly what I wanted. If you look at the picture and you like it even a little, you will love it when  you get it.

434374,"Cheaply made, low quality workmanship & material.  Crudely done.  The loop is too long, should be 1-1.5"" shorter than it is.  Good thing it is hidden inside the pants.  Until I find a better quality safety money belt for my husband, this will do for now.",2

A little wrinkled in the skirt and chiffon is difficult to steam, wished there was a better way to package it but not anyone's fault. A couple of the sequins were loose so had to tie off the ends of threads so they didn't fall off. Overall lovely dress and perfect for daughters homecoming!",4
486153,Buying this locket taught me to read the fine print cause pictures can be deceiving. The locket is very cute but very tiny. I bought this for my grandma who collects bears. When it arrived I was so worried that she wouldn't even be able to see the bear on the front of the locket. It is very hard to open as well. I was really disappointed in this piece of jewelry that did not even come with a chain. READ THE SMALL PRINT!!,2
492443,"The white bra fit perfectly, but the black one was about 3 times smaller.  I'm still nursing my infant, so I needed something comfortable to sleep in.  The white one fit the bill.  Would have given this product a higher rating, but the mismatched sizes were strange.",3
365160,This is made very well! Stitching appears to be of good quality and the fabric is just like the photo. The sides do dip low and do show your bra a bit. The fabric is slightly see through but with nude undergarments shouldn't be any problem! Light and perfect for summer!,5
224258,I  this!!!! It's comfortable and fits perfect. It shows what you want it to show and hide what you don't. I got it for my man  wore it for him and he loved it. His impression when i came out... You can also just wear the whit little pice loved it..... Two ..,5

57962,"My son looked adorable in this romper. It fit about like I expected. He's quite a bit longer than what is average at his age, so the pants were a little too short, but not enough to matter. It was perfect for a spring baptism. He never wore the cap, but I'm definitely pleased with the outcome, especially for the price.",5

I wore it at my friends wedding by the end of the night I had rashes under my arms from the dress rubbing so much. It was very painful, which made wearing this dress feel very unpleasant. Also, I was a bridesmaid and all of us bridesmaids ordered this same dress in the same color, but ALL of the dresses came in differnt shades of purple.  It was very strange.  Not at all, the greatest buy. :(",2

Provides good coverage and support without feeling too binding like some sports bras. Stays in place and does not ride up. Will wear it under a swim shirt but looks good enough to wear alone with swim shorts or swimsuit bottom. The fit and quality is far better than anything I could find locally in stores. Had an initial glitch returning the Medium but hopefully that's resolved now.",5
835983,"It runs small and is not high quality.  But for the price, that's to be expected.  It runs really short in the torso, so if you are tall or have a long torso, this might not work for you.  Too short might better describe instead of too small.",3
786423,"It's a good shirt.  A bit on the small side though.  I usually wear medium athletic t-shirts.  This one is just a bit tighter than I usually find them.  Its also a good length for working out, sometimes these shirts run too short.  Overall I like the shirt and will probably order a size up for the next design.",4
731443,I ordered an x-large. I usually wear a large..5'9 170lbs and what came in the mail has to be a joke. It is about a size small in all reality. There is also NO tag or anything. Very cheap.  So disappointed with this. I thought I'd get lucky in finding a cheap cardigan...nope! Went straight to my donations bag.,1

If they actually were true to size I would have kept them, but to get the ones that would fit I would need three or four sizes bigger than advertised based on how these ones fit, and they don't make 'em that big.

These are child sizes... you have been warned.",1
409125,Ordered it about a week ago and it came in today.  Looks great and is quite heavy which is good so you will know if it happens to fall off.  Was looking at some in the jewlery stores and the minimum price was around $100 so this is a great deal (just hope the finish don't scratch off).,5

I am always afraid about the sizing when I buy online, but I had no problem with the length of this. It looks very pretty and stylish. Although, I did receive this product at a discount, it was for an honest review only. I highly recommend it so much, I will probably buy more braceles of this style in the future.",5
588911,What a waste of money.  I didn't purchase these via Amazon but rather on Kate Spade's website.  I wish I had known how big these really were otherwise I would not have purchased them.  They are huge.  Embarrassingly so.  I was going to give these to my 19 year old niece but not now.  I can't return them (final sale) and cannot gift them.  Yuck.  Something at Claire's would've been cuter.,1

One reviewer said it was see through, but I don't have that issue.",4

Well, it's not that bad for the price but could have been better, the positive's the logo is like a scout tag you sew on it, it look good but some white thread was falling from it.

He is 2 months old, 13 lbs, and 24 inches long and the 3-6 month size fits well with a bit of room to grow. Since the feet aren't covered I think it'll fit him longer and it seems more comfortable as he gets more active.",5
718652,"The product gets one deducted star because it shrunk (quite a bit) after the first wash. The fabric is thin and light, so it's a perfect wrap for spring mornings or summer evenings. The pockets are a nice touch. Overall, you get what you see - a simple, comfortable, light wrap.",4

What I really love is teh nylon ties - my original hat had cheap lether ties that broke and were really thin.  I normally wear a 7-1/4 but went with the XXL becaus of previous customers' comments.  Though it might be a slight bit large, the padding in the hat makes it fit properly.  I suspect the XL would have been snug or small.",5
467748,"I knew that petit ami runs large prior to purchasing but it doesn't really matter to me since the sleeves are short. The preemie size is actually more of a true newborn. The color is closer to blue than mint but it is absolutely lovely. Petit ami makes timeless, high-quality dresses.",5
523567,I ordered the size XL and when I received it... it is very nice but was more of a size medium. . The size chart is off however this is well made and makes a great gift. So order a bigger size when ordering this item. The seller was very fast on helping me with my return and I would recommend them to my friends.,4
574389,If you wear a size small order it in L! This has to be incorrect sizing as my daughter is tiny and petite and normally a small is big on her. I read reviews that it was sized small so I ordered a medium and I'm glad I did because the medium is tight on her. Other than that it's a beautiful soft and warm coat.,3
686891,This was the cheesiest costume I have ever ourchased for the price. I have 8 grandchildren and 5 children so I have bought many costumes. The worst was that the cardboard box head had to be assembled. Plis it was difficult for my grandson to walk around in and hold the candy bag. It took twi hands to keep the box in place. Shame in the manufacturer and Amazon for marketung this piece of junk. I tried not to give this any stars but was forced to guve it a one star rating in order to post my opinion.,1
37182,This is an adorable sun hat. Its lightweight And the straps are long so its easy to tie.  I just wish the brim was a little more sturdy but overall its a great hat and easy to clean if need be. It keeps the sun off her face and neck.,4
73370,"the chain was well built but the clasps are press folded together and not solid at all.  Twice I have had to repair the chain in less than a year.  When my fiance is in surgery she used to put her ring on the chain, but she can't trust the chain.  Now she has the anesthesiologist hold her ring.  the durability is an issue.",2
351666,"I bought the grey one to this first and the material is very thick and strong and it is not transparent.

However this one is,  the material is completely different,  it is so thin you can see everything under it,  even My skin can be seen.  Buy the grey,  no other color.  I should have just bought another grey",2
852811,these are leggings they fit as i thought they would im prego and got the 2X/3X they stretch a lot i was a size 18 before i got pregnant i have one more month to go so i think these are awesome and very comfortable and they fit my pregnant body which is awesome because i have had a hard time finding plus size maternity jeans that are not expensive.,5
820589,"I am a 36DD, 5'5"", 160lbs; my measurements are 39 Chest, 28 waist, and 42 hips. I ordered the size recommended to me via their size guideline. While the bottoms fit well, if not too large, but the top was horribly sized: the bands were large enough, but the coverage wasn't near enough based upon the sizing. :/",1
258530,Very cute design. Good tread and construction thus far. My daughter has been wearing these off and on for almost 2 weeks. So far so good.  The only thing I've noticed is that she tends to trip on carpet. The rubber and the tread is a little much for indoor wear. She is learning to pick up her feet.,5
276981,"Wasn't too sure at first if I liked how these looked but after wearing them a few times I love them. They are polarized so looking at your phone is weird but everything else looks sharp. They are a dark tint, darker than I expected but great for super sunny days here in Florida. Comes with a carrying bag that you can also use to clean them. Great value for the price! They feel more expensive than they are.",5
187221,The top was a perfect fit but the bottom had issues. It was too big overall but was too small getting on and off. This leads to stitch snapping noises every time you pull the bottom on and off. Then the bottom is too big to stay up afterwards. It also is very loose.,3
53260,Nice wide brim to keep the sun off my little mans head. He is 18months but has a rather large noggin so I got the 2-4 year size. It's got this zip tie like string around the base of the part that goes over his head that tightens up so it fits him perfect and can be adjusted as needed. The tie for underneath his chin is nice and long so I can make sure I tie a good knot so it will stay on his head. Would buy again and reccomend it to others.,5
472054,Terrible! After reading reviews I thought this woyld be great..the top was way to small and the torso way to big. Beware as the cup sizes listed are wrong! A D/DD cup is really a B cup. When i went to return - I have to pay the postage! Rwally??? The suit IS NOT what they say and the sizes are incorrect...false advertising beware!,1
145571,"I'm wearing it from the moment I received it.  The size is perfect, the brilliance of this ring is amazing.  The sparkle and shine makes it difficult to tell that it isn't diamonds!  Exactly what i was looking for for a right handed decorative ring.  PERFECT!",5
25338,I thought these would be comfortable but that was not the case. I tried them out once and they were no different than the standard orthotic that came my New Balance athletic shoe.  I'll stick to my tried and true Aetrex brand orthotics which are also available on Amazon.  I hope the Powerstep Orthotics will help someone else -- I put them back in their package and donated them to charity. I do not recommend these.,1
266058,"This outfit is very cute, especially if your child loves tutus.  It held up but the tutu has these floss like strings that are coming out of the layers.  We had to cut some off so that they wouldn't get pulled out.  I believe if they get pulled out, it will ruin the tutu.  They are all over, so little hands can easily start pulling on them.",4
275072,"This review addresses the free replacement belt sent to me by Marina, following a less-than-five-stars review I had submitted. The new belt works very well, having the lift mechanism rather than the button slide thing. Beautifully packaged, makes for an excellent present, especially as it can be trimmed easilt to just the perfect length. The key fob is a nice lagniappe, as well. Company really does want to be stand out firm.",5
21615,"Love, love, love this hat for my 10 week old! It is hard to find a hat that will stay on the head of a fidgety infant but this hat did it! It has an adjustable band that can be fitted to the head and straps to tie around his chin. Stayed on the entire time we were at the beach and kept him well protected! Will definitely buy again when he outgrows this one.",5
280139,"I typically wear an 8 to 8.5, and the size 8 in these sandals were way too large. The size 7 fits perfectly. Very comfortable, and I will get a lot of wear out of them. I have high arches, and these support my arch so that I can wear them all day comfortably.",5
40609,"Purchased a pair of these socks thinking they would most likely be too short, and not truly Thigh high. I was wrong! I'm 5'7 and 140 lbs and they are definitely Thigh-High they reach my mid-thigh. I am rating this 4 stars instead of 5 because the material is not high quality. The socks are difficult to get on as the material has very little stretchy-ness and is rather rough.",4
373004,Love the shirt. Of course sizes are off because its from china. But its a nice quality shirt. It only took like a week maybe a week and a half to get here. Which was way less than the expected arrival time. So glad i bought it. I wear a L XL U.S. size. I ordered the XXL slightly small but fits comfortably and has a stretch to it.,5
85709,"I wanted the brown tone polarized sun glasses with the flat shape that will fit in the smaller pocket in my 1997 Cadillac Eldorado.  These are the right color, they're the flat shape, and they have the best polarization of any sunglasses I've ever had.  I finally figured out that they sell for one tenth to one thirtyth of the price of glasses elsewhere because they don't grip the head very tightly when the head is looking straight down, but I can fix that.",5
307184,"I wear these shorts almost every day in the summer, they are simple in design but offer flexibility and sweat wicking that I appreciate. The color is a nice light khaki, could be worn casually or dressed up with a button down shirt. I'm 6'0"" and 175 lbs wearing a size 34. These shorts fit my waist perfectly and because I prefer the look of 'above-the-knee' length shorts I cuff the bottom once.",5
679574,The waist is constructed to hit right below the breast and ends up giving you a funny shape in the lower half. If they lowered where the top met the skirt it could be cute but instead you end up looking like you're wearing a bra top and pulled your skirt up way too high. Dissapointing,3
90,Bought this for my wife and did not read the fine print. I thought it safe to assume a women's cigarette case would hold 100's. Not the case (pardon the punn). so I had to return this and buy the correct size which of course can be found on Amazon.,1
682599,"I got a 7.5 (I am normally an 8) and they fit perfectly, even had enough room for a gel insert. They are comfy enough on their own, I just always check to see if I can fit an insert in case I'm going to be out longer than expected. They look amazing with my skinny jeans and leggings, and my flared pants, and even my dresses!! Versatile, comfy, and cute - the sought after trifecta for shoes!",5
362215,"Just spent a lot on new glasses to deal with my eye issues.  This is a nice stand - need to attach it somewhere though, as our youngest Doberman brought it out of the room to use as a toy the other day .. :)  It's well made, with good softness to protect the lens ...",5
297110,"I was so disappointed by this one :( I'm 5' 4"" and 120 lbs and the Medium was waaaay too small on me. The length between the shoulders and crotch is definitely off, because my butt was half-way out the bottom despite it being pulled down as much as possible. On top of that, I could barely get the romper over my hips to put it on, and the material is COMPLETELY see through even with nude undergarments... My one true romper is out there, but this wasn't it.",1
616674,"Item arrived in due time, excellent packaging and condition.  I am going to buy from here again for some colors.  This is the purse I have been looking for around this area for the past 3 years.  Not overly ornate at all, large enough for all I carry, and stylish.  Low key enough to take to mass with me every Sunday morning.  Others have had good comments to express about it.  Beautiful!",5
879488,"I love this cardigan/kimono/wrap/cover up! It's the perfect color for fall and the tie dye pattern would also work great at the beach. It's super lightweight, which I can appreciate living in Arizona where the weather is all over the place (or just hot!) most of the year. I'm 5'5"" and 120 pounds and while this is on the bigger side as far as size, I like that look. I haven't washed it, so I can't attest to how well it will hold it. I would absolutely reorder in more colors!",5
648345,"Its good for only about 5 or 6 uses if you wrap up the adhesive part. I would recommend this if you were trying to keep your breast up, but I'd recommend this if you're breast sit up by themselves you could wear this just to cover up your nipples. Overall, this product is worth it!",4
778108,"It was bigger than expected. The material seemed nice at the bottom, but at the top was really cheap. It doesn't cover your bust at all and is incredibly see-through. Don't waste your money.

Now I probably have to go buy a dress for homecoming that every other girl already has instead of having a unique one from online.",2
238218,very cute. I have three piercings on my ear lobe on each side and they fit nicely together. My only issue is that the backings on the earrings are very tight and difficult to remove. New earrings irritate my skin so taking them out at night is a bit of a struggle.,4
46966,"I don't know why you can't find these in a local store,  but I just LOVE THEM!!!  There are different brands and I have tried others, to get different colors, but the original Ear Mitts top them all!!!  If my ears are cold, especially with the wind,  my whole body is cold.  These are worth every penny!!",5
689910,"This is somewhat long, which I like. It's almost like a tunic - long enough to nearly cover my daughter's bottom for wearing with leggings. It's a soft, nice quality cotton and I'm always looking to add more colors to my daughter's wardrobe besides all pink/purple/turquoise, which seems to be the case with most retailers these days! Add a little scarf, sunglasses and a fedora and you've got one stylish babe!!!",5
409273,"It's exactly what I expected/hoped it would be. I'm a big G-Shock enthusiast. I have around 15 and this is definitely one of my favorites now because it's unique and tough to find. I wore it out recently and it turned heads and got its share of compliments. I would definitely recommend to fans of G-Shock or folks looking to get a quality, stylish/different watch that'll turn heads.",5
128567,I love this jacket.  I read some reviews before I bought this jacket and it helped so much.  The sleeves have velcro at the cuff so if they are too long you can use the velcro to tighten it so it doesn't fall too long.  It has a great hood with a little cute cap on it so the water doesn't fall in your face.  It is cut a little narrow on the bottom so I got the large (when I'm usually a medium) and it is perfect.,5
679607,"I really liked this dress. It looks just like the picture and it isn't too small in terms of tightness, it's just the waist comes up way too high. I'm 5'6"", wear a 34 D, and am long waisted. The picture shows the waist where it belongs, at the smallest part, but the waist actually came really high up on the ribs for me (almost right under my breasts). It just didn't look or feel right, so I had to return it. If you have a shorter waist, or a modest bosom, this is a really cute buy.",3
594658,"The dress is beautiful and it was shipped promptly. However, it fits really small. Bought the XL for my wife and my 11 yrs old daughter ended up with it. So if you weigh a hundred pounds or there about, you might want to consider the XL. The dress originates in China so I guess it was made to fit Chinese people who normally has small statue.",3
348242,"This fits me perfectly.  I will not and can not wear the blind fold though. The blind fold. Fight me but bothers my eyes a lot afterwards.  I am 5'7"" or 5'8"" and weight like 116 lbs. So if you are my height and weight I would definitely recommend this for you",5
237466,"i loved the look of this, sadly I was shocked by what was left at my doorstep, it has very loose fitting sleeves that are short and rolled quite far up. The material seems to have been knit or crocheted quite badly as it's very thin with lots of gaps, maybe wearable in spring but not useful to keep warm",2
342527,"Love the fabric, love the style.  My only complaint is the set I got is just a tad tight under the arm pits for some reason -- doesn't seem like the styling would allow for that, but perhaps it's just a defect in the set I got.  I take a medium so it's not like I have a lot of extra adipose in that location, lol but other than that, I love these pjs and will continue to buy them as long as they are available.  Perfect summer weight evening pjs and look good too.",4
564020,"Really like this top, great picture of a skull, but the flowers draw your eye first.  Down lower, the skull is a great surprise.  Even though the picture of the skull is pretty large, it takes a minute or two for someone to notice the skull!!  Really great top.",5
470592,This was bought for my husband and he was disappointed in the product. The belt occasionally slip out from the back of the buckle and the tip on the insert end of the belt catches on clothing and has partially come of the belt a few time. We don't think we will be buying this product again. Sorry.,2
588758,"For the price I was disappointed it's very big so that's nice but the quality is cheap the plastic film over the id slot makes it so difficult to see the id without having to take it out, and the overall feel is like cheap knock off leather I've paid the same price for a clutch similar to this one but it was a lot nicer so this one was definitely a disappointment for the price",3
722764,"I ordered a 2XL.  I wear a size large shirt in the US.  I weight 150 pounds and can't wear this shirt.  Be very careful in size selection.  The product looks great, but clearly I don't understand UK sizing.  I love the shirt, but I can't wear it.",3
426886,"It's always been a challenge for me to find bras that fit, so I was not very optimistic when I purchased this bra online.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that this bra fits well and is very comfortable.  The bra stays in place, doesn't ride up or roll around the band.  I wear an A cup, so I can't speak to how well this would work for someone who is more endowed, but I am very pleased with this purchase.",5
245751,This swim suit is sewn wrong. it does not fit like the picture. Instead of having the gap in the middle the shoulder straps are sewn closer together and it gives off ALOT of  side boob. I will end up altering it since i know how to sew so that it matches the picture. As for the bottoms........they don't fit like the picture either. I will be wearing a different bottom with this top. This suit is just all wrong!,1
581682,I absolutely love the onesie! i try to wear it as much as possible. I only have one complaint and that is that the in seam is a little high... just high enough to want to sit down around people but not enough so that it is unbearably embarrassing. I would definitely buy again but to the manufacture can you please make the crotch just a little lower!,5
483124,"This arrived today, 10 days earlier than the earliest delivery estimate, and it's exactly what I hoped it would be! I love it! It will be so versatile. It can be worn with jeans, leggings, shorts, a skirt; dressed up or dressed down for work or play! I'm glad I took a chance and ordered it. The price was fantastic and shipping was free!",5
653819,"Feels very cheap. The material is something that you would use for a Halloween costume, cheap and itchy. The fit of the dress is very boxy. It doesn't fit my curves, plus, it made my hips looks HUGE! Also, the train is way too long. I thought some heels would help, but unless you plan on wearing 8"" heels, it wouldn't work. Disappointed to be honest. Atleast I can use it for an Elvira costume....",1
767887,"This dress is beautiful, and I bought it in black and gold. Loved the gold one, but you can see the lining of the black one right over my breast. I tried steaming it to get it to lay flat and not show, but no luck. Lots of compliments and great dress for the price.",4
264835,I absolutely love these sunglasses. The light red color shows off the grain of the wood. They are adequately sized for my oval shaped face. These are well made and the hinges are of excellent quality. The polarized lens are an added bonus. Great sunglasses for  a modest price.,5
717018,Ordered this for my daughter who is living away from home. She felt it was not adequate to meet the needs of a missionary serving in Oregon in the Spring. She mailed it back to me and now it is too late to get a refund. :-( Very light and flimsy raincoat.,1
100746,"I can't say that I expected the shipping to be quick, but I did expect the picture to be true to what the actual mask was. When wearing it, the muzzle of the horse is always down, so it's impossible to see, it reeks of a paint smell, and the paint is poorly applied itself.",2
489694,"I bought these for my 6 year old. My daughter is fairly tall for her age and the gloves were a little big. She said they kept her warm but I noticed that after an hour of hard play in the snow, they were wet all the way through. The gloves were perfect for skiing but not for constant hands on play in the snow. During skiing she said they were fine.

We liked the cute zig zag pattern.  Good for skiing, not so much for hands on play in the snow.",3
139975,"It's such a BAD color; bubblegum pink, not nude at all.  Too lazy to return it so I'll use it under darker, opaque tops or maybe even in a swimsuit but it could never be used under something sheer.

I've bought and used lots of these stick-on bras in the past - they're just more comfortable than a regular bra and perfect under lightweight or sheer fabrics.  They are not designed to push up or give you much support. If you need/want lift, these bras are not for you.",2
830448,"What an amazing dress! Based on my measurements, I didn't know which size to order, the small or the medium because I was in between the sizes. But when I posted a question on Amazon on this issue for this dress, I received some really good advise to order the medium. Thanks ladies! I was so beautiful at the banquet my husband and I attended. My measurements are 36, 30, 35/36 and 135 lbs @ 5'5.""",5
534075,"For the price it's a steal. The mesh is not really very ""meshy"". It's a standard molded cup bra. But they fit like a glove and i'm not constantly adjusting them. I'm a 32B which means I can almost NEVER find my size. So of course amazon to the rescue. I was hesitant at first because bras are so tricky, but i'm glad I risked it. They fit nice and snug. Just wish they were a tiny but less ""molded cup"", and were more natural to my breasts.",4
496565,"The model shows this hitting several inches above the knee, but on me it hits right at bottom of knee (I'm 5'1""). I like the look and style and planned to use it as a swim suit cover up. However, I found this fabric very scratchy and it didn't breathe. I was sweating bullets on the beach and at pool under this. It also doesn't stretch, so trying to get it over my head to remove it before swimming (while sweating in 90 degree heat) was darn near impossible.

Will save this for indoor (air conditioned) water parks.",3
241221,"This is the second purchase I've made of a tungsten ring from this company. I purchased the first one for myself and this one for my husband. After nearly 12 years of marriage our original wedding rings were really beaten up. These rings are very classy, comfortable, affordable, super strong and crazy durable. I wish we had just gotten these rings years ago! I highly recommend these, whether it's a replacement or your first wedding band. You really can't go wrong with these.",5
417911,This frame is perfect for any Disney fan. I recently purchased it when I came back from my Disney trip 2015. I received it date as promised and in great condition. The quality of the frame is great and the price is perfect. Don't just stare at it. Get it!,5
132026,"I wasn't expecting too much from this shirt, but wanted to try it out. The shirt just covers my boobs, making it more like a bandeau with sleeves. Not gonna exchange it cause I am wayy too lazy. But Ill maybe wear it if i have high waisted bottoms and a cardigan.",2
114767,"I purchased this hat to go with a sundress I already purchased to wear to the local derby day.  I love the hat, it was the perfect color for my dress & shoes.  I would purchase again in different colors. The brim was much wider than I expected but that was a good thing for the derby, the bigger the better.",5

Legend has it that this shirt is the reason Kim Jung Un is scared of the US. He should be. 'Murica!",5
335970,The material is strange. It has a crispness to it and feels almost like a uniform. I was told it looks like a nurses smock. I expected it to be soft and flowy. It isn't as long as it appears in the picture. I would not wear it with leggings.,3
681824,"This is a fabulous addition to my handbag collection. It looks expensive. The yellow is more of a mixture of orange and gold, I think. This fringe bag is so cool and reminds me of the 1970s or late 1960s  when hippies abound. It also got here very quickly. Thank you!",5
370270,"The price on these was awesome, delivery time was prompt, the fabric is luxuriously soft, fit is perfect, they are thick enough to not be see-through yet thin enough to sit smooth - I was so thrilled with these. Wore them today for the second time since buying them and just noticed a 4-inch run in the crotch. I am disappointed to discover that these awesom leggings have no staying power.",2
47623,"I really wanted to love these - but I couldn't get them to stay on my ears.  If you have larger ears they may work for you.  However, my husband (with larger ears) tried them and they wouldn't stay on either.  Also, I should add that we wore them for cycling and any amount of wind would take them right off... Perhaps if you were just walking around it wouldn't be an issue... again for larger ears..",2
72288,"This shoe is sized at least one full size too large. Also, it's quite wide, and there is a significant heel height. My daugter's foot slid around a lot while wearing them.

749554,"these are okay.  Not low rise as i would have expected.  Somewhat short as well, when you sit down you may  have some issues.  Would not buy again but probably will not return as well.  Most likely will go in my underwear drawer and will use occasionally but will not make the daily routine.  Still looking...",3
808398,"Received this today. Highly disappointed. Not exactly as pictured. Picture shows the front neckline cut much lower than it is. It's not a v-neck cut at all! Additionally, coverall hints to a more tapered fit, this is nothing more than an over sized cut that fits over the head and drapes like a huge Moo moo. Nothing sexy about this; trust! Better off using a beach towel as a coverall",1
239799,"I love it.  I purchased a white gold for my wedding and it scratched and started to fade. My husband got the Tungsten and look much better than mine so I decided to purchase the same material ring ( such an affordable price). No regrets, the ring it's little thicker than my old one but it is always shiny and it looks brand new. I work out, do weights, cook, do the dishes and It's like nothing ever happen to it. I highly recommend it. You won't be disappointed.",5

The lace down the middle front definitely hides any flaws.  Looks and feels sexy on.  I was a little shy at first but within minutes my husband's reaction made me felt confident in it.",5
415677,"I ordered this as a gift for my niece, age 4. It's really cute and I love that it's a little unconventional because the adults in our family are a little unconventional too. It is only one pocket so it's probably not so good for older kids that have more school books and supplies to carry but I think it will be useful for at least a few years. It feels very sturdy and feels like it can handle being tossed around. It feels like something that can last for awhile.",5
1146,Beautiful ring. I ordered a 7 and it is too big for left ring finger but fits right ring finger.  Going to order one for my mom.  Very unique.  Also ordered amber ring in 6. Fits left ring finger great.  All the items I ordered met or exceeded my expectations.,5

Luckily my wife is handy with a needle and thread and was able to fix it. Extremely warm!",4

I purchased this product at a discounted price for my honest review.",4
851163,"My daughter really liked this dress and chose it as a wedding dress. The dress is really pretty and the lace is beautiful, but even after sending the precise measurements, it was still too big and way too long.  We had to have it professionally altered in order for her to wear it. The amount of time it took to get it to us was sufficient. So, if the dress had fit, we would have given it  a 5 star rating.",3
351531,I ordered two pairs. The dark gray ones look great and I've been using them for four months for working out. The pink ones I had to return right away. They were completely see through. I gave two stars based on the pink ones because I have already left a great review for the gray ones!,2
487204,"I purchased this for my 13 yr old nephew for one of his Christmas gifts and he LOVES it!! He races and this was a perfect gift ! Even his dad (my brother) wished he had one, ha!  So I might have to surprise my bro with one.   I am really happy of the quality of it, very pleased!! Thx!!",5
529493,"This skirt is beautiful, but it's about 6 inches shorter than what I expected. As many other people mentioned, it has only one layer of tulle over the skirt. Mine seems to be a bit sheer below the knee, and only falls to my ankles (I'm 5'2""). Overall, it made for a very cute and full tea-length skirt when worn over a petticoat. On its own, it was more like a maxi. It'll be perfect for my Halloween costume.",3
128388,"It's light and easy to carry. Not fitted at all, so it feels pretty big if I'm not wearing a second coat or sweatshirt underneath. There is plenty of room if you want to wear a thicker coat under, though. Wish it had pit zips and that it adjusted on both sides at the bottom, not just one, otherwise it's a great deal. Waterproof, although the I haven't warn it in really heavy rain yet.",4
29554,This is an nice costume for the curvy woman.  There room for you if you slim down or gain a little weight. You can  roll the skirt up to make it shorter for a sexier appearance.  It is a great design for a woman trying to hide some weight issues.,5
185379,"Great slip! It did the job well - it held out my poofy skirt :)  It was a little scratchy, but next time I'll know to wear a longer slip underneath. It was just slightly tight on top but comfortable - I'm more of a M/L size in general, it looks like this is labeled a S/M.",5
848800,"I reallly liked the design but  I'm a large size female even when I purchased the large size in this top it didn't even go down past my beast becuase it was too small for me, If you're petite you'll like it but if you wear a size large don't waste your money",2
140468,"I bought the ring to go with this cute earring set, if you want flamboyant this won't be the accessory to use, if you want, cute, simple and casual, this won't be too shabby! I use it with jeans & a cute top, I can mix this set with black or gold jewelry.",4
250242,"Exactly what I was looking for after my hip replacement surgery!  I love how the length can be adjusted short and long up to 31.  Very solid product!  Glad I took my time looking for the right product and price.  Similar items were double the price. Delivery was very fast, 2 days, and it was free shipping too!",5
435752,"The coat is nice and warm but a large is way too snug. I certainly didn't eat that much for the Holidays
The return policy just plain S*cks. Don't they realize Christmas gifts don't get opened until Xmas.
But that is just good old American Capitalism! (Made with cheap Chinese labor) Take the money and hide behind some fine print.",4
514861,"Its a very nice clutch and the perfect size to hold the essentials. I bought the black. I only have 2 very slight issues with it. The chain is too long and feels frail and there isn't a little back pocket to hold my money and cards. I didn't realise it when I was looking at it. But I do plan on ordering at least 2 other colours, so the issues aren't that big a deal for me. Hope the other colours, brown and turquoise, look as nice as they do in the pictures.",4
370916,"I am thinking I would have liked this shirt if I'd gone a size up from what was recommended. I want to love it, the concept is cool but the fit is kinda wonky and the bottoms of the sleeves are downright weird. Like, there's a gathered cuff weird..

EDIT to add:

Ok, I've actually worn the shirt out now and I like it a little better than my first impression. I still don't like the cuff on the sleeve, but I just pulled it up to my elbow and it worked ok. Not a bad shirt.",4
793220,"Loved the fit of these leggings but unfortunately they arrived with a hole in the crotch area. I may possibly stitch these up but it's clear that considering the quality of these leggings the rips will only happen again. Very sad, as the cut of these was exactly what I have been looking for. I would love to work with the seller if possible to see if we can fix this issue because I really do love the fit of these leggings!",1
354288,"Perfect! Exactly what I was hoping for, and so inexpensive! I didn't want to pay hundreds of dollars for something I could run up myself for significantly less than that but I couldn't beat this price! Product came on time in excellent condition, and I am thrilled with my purchase!!",5
76111,"I went by the sizing guide on the website (pull down), but the sizing guide on the packaging was different (I think). I should have gotten a 2 instead of a 3, but the quality of the product is really good. Well made. Maybe it was user error. so I would just verify the sizing. Definitely go by BellaBand's sizing. I think it's probably pretty accurate.",3
572474,"I just recieved this STUNNING ring today. The rings came in almost a month earlier the diamonds are stunning,they shine everywhere.
.I couldn't believe my eyes. I cried when i opened it up. I couldn't believe my eyes. I cant wait,to wear it. When i ordered it,i didnt,realize that it had diamonds inside..You want a rate of five stars,i give it TEN....THANK YOU again.",5
414462,"I love this girdle!  Who would have thought those words would ever come out of my mouth.  It is good to see this fashion and function piece come back.  By the way, I'm not 70 years old.....actually, I am in my mid-forties....but I can still appreciate a good thing when I find it!",5
860556,"i ordered  a much larger size and it was still to small- the crotch fit really weird on me and I could not figure out how to wear it in a flattering way. i bunched up in the crotch but tried to create a wedgie in the back.

Also, I expected denim, or material closer to denim and it was just a polyester print- very cheap material.",1
607470,"The seams were not well sewn. Many of them popped and I wasn't even doing anything strenuous like dancing in it. I walked to our table, sat down and had to go home without dancing because the seems popped. The dress was not too tight or anything, just poorly made. I left it at 2 stars because it was beautiful on.",2
325407,"Worked perfectly for our musical!  Paired with black pants, it was a fabulous look, and with the reversible colors we got two costumes for one!  The red is darker than I expected--maybe a wine red?  Not quite burgundy though.  I ordered L and XL for my kids, and both are very skinny, so I was nervous that they'd be too big, but the sizing chart provided was accurate and very helpful.",5
79862,I stumbled across this dress by accident while looking for a dress to wear to a wedding. I ordered it last Friday and received it 2 days later. I couldn't wait to try it on. I'm a size 16 with a bust size of 40DD. The dress looked AMAZING. It hugs in all the right places and the material quality was even better than I had imagined. I look forward to my next purchase from Funfash.,5
801228,"I love this!!  I've been wearing every day and it certainly helps bring down the stress level at work. I mix my own essential oils..geranium, clove, lemongrass, mint.... when the stress goes up, I lift it up take a deep breath...stress level down. The side benefit is everyone asks what smells so good and when I tell them most remark that they didn't even know diffuser necklaces existed!  I highly recommend. They make great gifts!!",5
485370,"I guess I was expecting way too much for such a low price.  In addition to being very cheaply made, the front cover came off right after I opened the package and exposed the dial and numbers.  The black paint that forms the design inside the cover was badly scratched.  I did manage to reattach the cover but I am probably never going to wear this watch.  I will most likely be giving it to Goodwill or let my granddaughter play with it because it is not worth the effort to return it.",2
161960,"I'm kidding, of course they're one sided, it shows that in the photo. Both look EXACTLY like the photo. I have to wear both of them because of reasons, but I still think it was worth the buy. They're bigger than I pictured but not gaudy. Wish I could present the other half to the person it was meant for but hey, that's not Yazilind's problem lol Would definitely buy again.",5
5733,"I ordered 32x32, which is the size for all my other pants including one from carhart I bought at the same time. It fit more like a 30x32; the waist was too tight and the length was appropriate. I have exchanged for 33x32 and will see how it fits. The material feels good, and I anticipate these lasting me for a while on work sites.",3
407263,"I love this purse!
I actually got it from another seller in amazon,
but it is the exactly same bag.
Everywhere I go somebody tells me that is a nice bag.
The purse looks very nice for the price that you paid for.
Everyone think it is leather unless they smell it.
I will recommend this purse 100%!",5
153483,"I like this one a lot. I'm 5'11 with a larger neck, so the extra length allows me to adjust this tie to drop either above or below my belt. Colors are very attractive and seems to be of good quality. Since its made in china, can't be certain of the longevity though.",5
232910,"Great wallet, I've currently got 6 cards and 10 bills in it and the wallet is still only half an inch thick.  For the first time in my life I have a front pocket wallet that has made it more then a week before being abandoned.  I smile every time I put it in my pocket!",5

The pearl they sent me was all dinged up and had scratches on it,  no way was I going to give it to my wife! !! I've sent it back and now I'm waiting to see what they do! !",1
328346,While I LOVE these leggings - they do run a bit large. Also (because I loathe replacing clothes) - I suggest line/hang drying them to prevent faster wear. Just keep in mind that these give as they are made of spandex.... I've found myself constantly pulling them up every time I stand up from my chair. the overall fit through the legs is nice.,5
428634,"This top is wonderfully soft, much softer than I would expect from a rib knit item. It fits close enough to the skin to use as a layering top, but is actually just a little looser than I normally like. The lace is fully backed by the soft main fabric, so there's no scratchiness, and it is much more likely to survive many washings than tops with bare lace.

I just wish they had it in more colors.",5
562499,"This thing is perfect for summer weather. I know it's too hot for a beanie, but... I'm against washing my hair. Putting all those harmful chemicals (shampoo) on me daily is terrible for my health, and my greasy hipster style. That's why I wear this thing every day. It completes my, ""My-inflexible-hipster-style-is-too-cool-to-account-for-the-weather"" look, AND covers up my nappy greasy hair when I'm forced to go someplace other than overprice coffee shops, dive bars, and thrift stores, where people aren't cool enough to appreciate the grease.",5
211926,"Purchased for my 5 year old daughter for her traditional pair of PJ's that my kids open up on Christmas Eve.  Liked the adorable shirt, but the pants fit a little small. After my daughter wore them all day on Christmas, the next time she put them on after I first washed them, there was a large hole right in the crotch of the pants.",3
445603,"These are very hard to fit because people have very different toes. These fit someone who normally wears size US women's 5.5. She usually wears child size 3 or Euro 36, but in these, she took a size 37. She had surgery for arthritis and hopes to straighten her toes by wearing these. She's 86 years old and loves these! Her 8 year old granddaughter wanted to take them from her.",5
442190,"Received the beautiful pendant in a great size for every day wear and the color is
outstanding!  I can't be happier with this pendant. The diamond really pops out against the stone blue color. I was afraid it would be too small and disappear but that was not the case. I'm really happy with this purchase",5
858324,"Company has fast customer service! I used their size chart and I'm 5' 6"" 140lb and fit. An XL wouldn't fit my thigh. It's to bad because these pants are made well feel great and are very cool looking! I don't know what size model they use but this would fit a young teenager. I'm disappointed they didn't work out but for those they will fit you get a great deal. There're no liner and I can't say if they would be see thru when wet but the material is thick. I loved them.",3
341129,"I tried them on right after I got them.  They fit just fine and I love the color. (navy blue).  The waist is a little large for me, but since I will be wearing them as leggings not for athletic endeavors they should be just fine.  I plan on wearing them with a tunic or other longer top.  Great value and they appear to be well made.",5
593010,Son wanted a Boba Fett shirt and he enjoyed getting this but it isn't the most impressive looking design on the shirt. It is fine for a childs shirt where you don't always expect perfection but if this was a adults shirt I would recommend something else as it isn't the greatest design.,3
292981,"This item is black plated over what appears to be stainless steel.  I have not had an issue with skin sensitivity yet so I am going to say so far it seems to be stainless steel.  The coating comes off which to me is cheap! I have other body jewelry where the metal is black, so I know its possible to purchase black body jewelry.  These guys need to tell people this item is coated and not black.  Poor quality. Very cheap.

UPDATE: Dont buy! I had to throw them away.  Such poor quality",1
496965,"Good material, good bag.  BUT why why? why SOOOOO Heavy??  OMG !! So heavy.  Yes I understand it has to be rolled, but it is not making sense if I am taking it as a carry on in the flight and more than half of the 11KG allowed on flights is taken by this teeny weeny heavy weight bag.

I like it but I don't like it too......",4
803949,Bought this in a 2xl and it fits like a us 1xl no problem since the reason I buy 2xl is when I wash them they will shrink-so this one I will hand wash in the sink and let air dry. Nice shirt will order again. P.S. bought this in orange and in black and they all fit a little tight but are really nice- size is off just a little.,4
62126,I bought this before having the baby for a planned csection. I didn't wear it immediately but started wearing it around 6 weeks. As my stomach started to go back it started sagging and at that point I started wearing it everyday. We're at 12 weeks postpartum and my tummy does not sag anymore and I feel support in my tummy/ back. I am definitely going to buy another. Highly recommend to women with a csection!,5
463098,dress is exactly as pictured. the sleeves & yoke of the dress are actually more of a tulle mesh than lace and it is not stretchy so may be tight on some peoples arms. the dress is fully lined so there is no need to wear a slip. the only issue for me was that the belt that came with it was 2 sizes too small but I was not planning on wearing it anyway so it is not a deal breaker for me.,5
103536,"I ordered this blouse on September 20th and it finally arrived today October 21st. It looked very pretty but I had to take off my glasses to squeeze it over my head. Needless to say it was too small even though I ordered a large. I am not even going to bother to send it back as it would probably take another month to get any type of acknowledgement. I will give it to my granddaughter who wears extra small. Pretty top, but I will not be buying from that company again.",1
10114,"This shoe may have potential but there were two major problems with this order and one minor issue.  The shoe is a full INCH longer than all my other size 9 athletic walker shoes! The width is good I suppose but the crazy length renders the shoe unfit.

 Even though the sizing of the shoe is NOT my fault, the seller does NOT pay return postage so to get my money back I have to pay to return these.  I will not reorder from this seller.

This order also took a long time to show up.",2

The sleeves are too tight and I can't wrap the coat around my waist. I wear a large normally in American sizes, but I knew this wasn't coming from the US so that's why I wanted a XL. But item was still too small. Thanks for spoiling my Birthday!",1
792407,"Its ok for a party. Batteries last long enough for at least 4 hours. Quality is very poor, no ergonomics at all. The electrical connections are very handmade, I even had to disassemble one shoe to fix it the first night we got them because it was not plugged and was rusted.",3
783133,"Only negative I have is on the white socks which seem to wear out very fast.  I don't seem to have the same problem with the dark pair for some reason.  The socks are very, very comfortable on my feet, but for the price I pay for them, they should last much longer than they do.",4
693183,I ordered an extra large and am normally a medium though I wanted it to be a little big it was smaller then expected. I was disappointed though it says that it is wool in the description and it is obviously flease so it is not as warm as you would expect,3
197822,"I bought this swimsuit for my teenage daughter because I wasn't spending $100++ on the popular TRIANGL brand or Victoria's Secret version of this color blocked neoprene bathing suit. This style is a big hit for summer 2015, and she HAD to have it. I definitely suggest buyers to seriously consider going up a size up than their normal size . We did our research before placing the order. It's good quality, well constructed, vibrant colors, washes well, and a perfect price. She's happy, and I'm happy. Win/win Situation. Best $25 I ever spent",5
833684,"This suit is very cute and fits well, except for the top. The cups are quite small for the measurements given. I'm a size 22 and it fits fantastic except for the cups and there is boob spillage on the sides and from the too small cups.  And if it didn't come from China I'd probably have sent it back for a return. This having been said I'm glad I bought it for use in our home pool and not for vacation.",3
829573,"These space pants are great.  It took a long time for them to ship to me, but man, they are amazing.  They fit well (I ordered 2 sizes bigger than I normally wear) and the seams are good.

I usually wear a size small, and I ordered a size small and it fit perfectly. the material is very good quality, it looks just like triangl! my only complaint is the bottoms, I usually like a cheekier bottom, but paying this price for just the top alone is worth it!! so cute!",5
418981,"I bought this item for the color and assumed it had a cotton crotch. Not only did it not have a cotton crotch the supposed to be a large fit like a small. Chalk it up as an impulse buy, will not buy any more of these unless from Hanes or Fruit of the Loom and it's cotton.",2
94751,I ordered this blood for finishing touches on zombies costumes that I made for Halloween and I wasn't extremely thrilled with the color once it dried. Its was a little pinkish for my liking. In the description it says dark real blood color and that just wasn't the case in my opinion. There is a lot in the bottle I barely used any and I made four costumes. I would recommend this product because of the price.,3
695842,"Lovely sweater that fits as expected for a casual fit. If you're looking for a snug sweater order a size smaller. The color is as it looks (on my screen). I also ordered this in Ivory, which is very pale, but isn't white. I noticed that the button holes on the Ivory sweater are smaller than on the Royal one which makes it harder to button than this one. All in all I like it and would order it again in another color.",5
257406,"I ABSOLUTLY LOVE THIS SUIT!! I'm happy that I read the reviews proir to buying so I knew it ran small. I ordered an XL and I am usually a Large in bust/hips.

Shipping was super speady and completely satisfied with it. Thanks :)",5

167747,"Found 90 degree reflex at my local marshalls and LOVED the fit and material... almost as good as lulu quality ...I tried to make sure that it was the same material and fit ... From the looks of the picture, I thought these were the seamless ones, but turns out that the stitching/seams are found on the lateral (outside) of the legs, which are pretty thick... other than that these fit great",4
555537,I am so glad I read the reviews on this. It fit wonderfully. The fabric does drape very nicely. The length was perfect. I am 5 foot 8 inches and a size 8 or 10 dress and curvy so it can sometimes be difficult to find something that fits well but this fit perfectly in a size medium.,5

Updated: ordered one medium one extra large. 2 pocket pants?  Had one pocket. Confused. Size large completely fell apart and the elastic waistband snapped and broke in the pants",2
334122,"Very cute and comfortable. According to the description this outfit is soft, thick and well made - great for fall and winter weather.  However, it is a middle weight cotton blend, to thin for the harsh weather weather. Slightly thicker then summer legging, yet much thinner than fleece jogging pants (just to give you an idea .",4

I may have to get another one.",5

Like that's going to happen) or I will more likely give it to my 21 year old.  I think it will fit her much better.  Sizing for this item was misleading and I'm bummed I can't wear it, but it'll make a great christmas gift.",5

Ariel is pretty faded together, arrived that way--not a result of washing or swimming.",3
632481,My son loves these (9 years old) but by the end of the day they are very stretched out due to the material type.  They are soft & comfortable but definitely lose their shape the longer they're worn.  The shape comes right back after washing & drying.  I wish there were size options.,3

834452,"I bought these to wear as ""mom jeans"" for a costume. They did definitely look like mom jeans, which was great, but I was also surprised at how much I ended up loving them! I'll probably continue to wear these to lounge around the house, or maybe when running errands. They were very comfortable: loose but not too loose, gentle fit around the waist, etc. For reference, I'm 5'10"" and 120 pounds and I got the size small.",5
612777,A really lovely dress...it runs big...buy one or two size smaller depending on how you want it to fit your body...very comfortable the material is stretchy....

497282,Very nice quality faux fur bolero for girls.  My 7 year old daughter wore this over her flower girl dress to my brother in-law's wedding.  Sometimes faux fur can look very cheap but this cover cup was really nice.  She will also be able to wear it with her Christmas dress if she is cold.  I would suggest ordering up 1 size.  My daughter is very tall & thin and the 8 was too short in the sleeves.  I ordered an 8 but had to return for the next size.,5

The top was also too small, but not quite as drastic as the bottoms.  I'm not that concerned, considering it was only around $8 and knew it was a calculated risk, but was hoping it would have worked out.  I don't know that ordering a large would have done the trick.....the sizing is just off",2
722299,I was looking for a nice beaded bracelet and couldn't decide between Tigers eye and Black onyx so I was really happy when I found the combination of the two of them. The matte black onyx really offsets the Tigers eye and it is very sharp looking. The bracelet seems well constructed and the beads are beautiful.  A comparable David Yurman bracelet that I was looking at cost over $400 for this size  bead. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a men's beaded bracelet.,5
841484,Ring was nice at first. After two weeks of wear diamond in it was missing without notice. If it was year time I could see maybe but not less than a month. I will be returning. I need to find another ring now. The intergrity of some of these products just do not hold up.,1
260328,Awful. Do not be deceived by the pictures because they send you is cheap decoy. In the pictures it looks to be constructed with heavy Cotten fabric but what I got in the mail was so thin and flimsy. The padding looked awful and didn't fit the bra not too mention you could see the padding clear as day through the cheap fabric. Hate it! Do not buy this!,1
393179,I've been looking for pant socks like this for years!  They are sheer like nylons so don't take up any room in the shoe or boot.  They fit perfectly around the ankles and don't slide down into the shoe nor do they fit so tight they leave marks on your ankles.  Just the best sock ever.,5
614722,"If I could rate this dress 100, I would !!!  Absolutely gorgeous !!  Well made!  Follow the chart on site for ordering !! I ordered the 12. (Could have gotten in 10 I'm sure) but it was perfect!!  I had soooooo many complements on this dress.  I'm 5'3 and I wore 6' shoes (2nd pic) On the first picture I had on my comfortable shoes (flats).",5
383703,"The feel is absolutely fabulous, and they are really beautiful, but they are a little tighter than I thought they should be for the range these fit. I am a size 16/18, so I figured there would be some additional give in these, but it's pretty limited even at my size. It's not cutting off circulation or anything, but it wasn't as stretchy as I would have liked.",3
755898,"I love this bag.  Everyone at work thinks it's a Vera Bradley because of the colorful pattern.  It is well constructed.  Fits my lap top with a lot of room for files, etc., plus an outside pocket for mouse and power cord. It has been through several Florida rain storms and everything inside stays nice and dry.  Best part is that my back feels so much better now that I am not carrying my computer and all my file in a shoulder bag.",5
364696,Love these pjs! My year and a half year old has been in size 2t for a while now... we have bought two different sets of these same pjs and the most recent pair seems to be a little bit taller... either way we love them! The designs are super cute and the fabric is extra soft. We live where the winters are cold so the thickness is perfect for a baby who doesn't know how to use a blanket!,5
276321,Really disappointed. My first pair was amazing (see top glasses). The plastic gave out and broke off the hinge after a couple months which is understandable. So I decided to order a new pair. Second pair (see bottom glasses) are not the same and slightly bent when arrived. Wish there was item consistency.,2
739077,"The sizes are way too small, definitely not made for Americans. Not to mention when I opened the package (that I waited almost a month to receive) the shirt was stained! The zipper is of extremely poor quality and the overall look is very cheap. Waiting for a return label from the company, and I'm not very optimistic I'll be getting that anytime soon. Definitely will be more diligent about reading reviews before a purchase clothes online in the future and certainly won't be  purchasing from this company again.",1
10467,"I'm an adult but I'm small so buying boy's is a nice way to save money. Sometimes that plan fails because a lot of children clothing is made somewhat cheaply. These boxer briefs are soft and comfortable and made of a good material. They don't ride up when I wear them. I would say that the only downside is that the elastic band is skinner than I am used to. However, these are great underwear and I've already purchased more in different colors.",5
761241,"soooo, the top is super cute, I am defiantly wearing it to my next festival. I'm a 36B and it fits me pretty well. The top stops at the edge of my boobs. It is also a little see through. The only problem I have with it is putting it on. The sting you use to tie the back together came fetched from the top itself and you have to lace it in to get the top on. Took me a little while but overall great top.",4
653734,"I was afraid that the dress run small so I ordered a large, but should have ordered in a medium.  I can still wear the large and it still looks good on me.  The material feels soft and it looks very classy. Looks great with a cardigan, scarf or jacket.  I highly recommend.",5
85378,This does not run small at all. So if your a small get a small!! It is a little thinner than I was expecting but still looks nice. I just wished I would have ordered my true size because I would be wearing it more often. It also came a lot faster than the expected delivery date.,3
254079,This is as described. I wish it told where the batteries go. It's obvious once you see it but had to look. There is a screw on one side that opens a panel on it. I was thinking it didn't light up but has an on/off button and the pictures shows it so I took a chance at removing the screw. The description doesn't say it lights up either. It's nothing expensive and is plastic but works well with the costume. My daughter is 9 so it's great for what we needed it for.,4
702754,"I was really hesitant of purchasing any clothing online. When the dress came, it was double sealed and packaged so well. I tried the dress on and it fit perfectly! I absolutely LOVE this dress! The picture does not do it any justice! The color is amazing and as mentioned, it fit perfectly!",5
550498,"Little disappointed. Bought this dress in brown and loved it. Not a fan of this ""red"". Not a very pretty red and doesn't seem as flattering as the brown. I was hoping this dress came in white so I could dye it whatever I want..but I think I may end up playing with some dye with this dress anyway",4
359274,Yoga pants feel so soft and light weight. The length is slightly long but then I'm 5' and long britches are fairly common for me. Am going to order another pair (same size) but in the other color. Love these fluffy pants; they are a comfort to wear. You won't be sorry if you order these.,5
199423,"Comparable to the Halo Big Kids Sleep Sack without the huge price tag. It is a little slimmer than the Halo but fits great and keeps my little one warm. The designs are adorable and shipping was much faster than I expected. I bought the L size and would say it's about a 4T - 5T for the Halo brand. My son is 5 1/2 and wearing size 6 clothes and he still has room to grow in this. All in all, I am very pleased with this product.",5
848057,"Beautiful bracelet. It looks very good on my granddaughter. It is big (even on my fat arms), but my granddaughter wears it on her upper arm with other bracelets and it looks very nice. I'm think of getting myself one, it'll be big on my wrist (won't go up to my fat upper arm), but that's okay because it's that cute.",5
11904,"I tried these instead of the superfeet that I had previously.  They seem to run small.  I have about a half inch of space between the end of my shoe and the end of the insert.  They definitely seem to give arch support.  I thought they would have more cushioning for plantar fasciitis, but they also seem pretty comparable to the superfeet blue that I had been using.  Overall, they are ok.",3
863264,"Cute hoodie. Love the lace design on the front...adds some visual interest to a typically somewhat boring piece. I ordered the gray and it's a lovely color. The material is somewhat scratchy and stiff, which is why I deducted a star, but I am hoping it gets softer in the wash.",4
36911,"This organizer is great! I purchased this for my daughter as a birthday gift. It makes getting dressed alot simpler with everything in sight instead of digging through clumps in the jewelry box. The only bad thing is that it does not hold over 125 pairs as stated in the promo, it actually only holds about 75 pairs but still a great idea. My daughter loves this and I plan on ordering one for myself as well.",5
845364,I absolutely love this onsie! It is beautiful! It arrived as expected! Make sure you go by the pounds. My son at 12 months is 25 pounds! My bf convinced me he would be 27 by then so we went with 24 months. Should of went with my gut for the 18 month size. It would have fit him perfectly! But not disappointed at all!!,5
730488,"We've had this suit in 0-6 month and 12-18 month sizes, and used them for trips to Hawaii at 3, 9, and 15 months. (The 0-6 month suit still fit at 9 months, just left a bit more of my daughter's ankles exposed.) This is an excellent full-coverage sun suit. It's much easier to zip this on than to apply sunscreen to an active toddler.",5
65548,"I'll first start off by saying that I am shocked with how fast they got to me!! Arrived a few days early. This is definitely worth the buy. So many cute tongue rings. I will definitely be buying again!! They have the coolest looking business cards as well lol very happy with this buy! It's a ""must have""",5
295201,"This shirt seems to be well made so far, and it actually is sewn so that there's a flare of material about the hips. I find so many don't do as advertised or stop doing so soon after. The material is also thick without being heavy. Only complaint I might have is just how low cut it is. It pulls down easily in front. This is not a deal breaker for me; I can pull it up just as easily too. ;)",5
123222,"I bought the red one with the ladybug as a gift for a toddler.  The purse is large enough to hold quite a few items so I plan to buy some small ""purse"" things and put in the purse as part of the gift.  It is very cute, well made and actually nicer than I expected so I am very pleased and I am sure the little girl will like it.",5
225436,"These are beautiful earrings, however I received a very light purple instead of the pictured dark, deep (almost blue) purple. The light purple one's are very light and not as vibrant looking as the dark ones appear in the picture. They seem fairly sturdy, instead of cheap-looking. They are sort-of larger than expected, but not too large. I do like them, but I would have preferred the color that is pictured.",3
291623,"Basic cotton material and definitely what I expected based on the photos. I'm very petite, 5'1 and 90lbs and I got the small which fits great! It's not super tight but I have a feeling after a wash and dry session, it'll start to conform to my body shape even better. Love the outfit ESP for the affordable price. It's also really comfy to move in!",4
414667,"I have always been a Kermit and a Jim Henson fan so this was perfect for a ""green themed"" key chain. The quality of the plastic is nice: thick and flexible, and it fit right over my key with little trouble. No complaints really just don't forget you put it on there and go looking for your key.

This is a definite purchase if you are a Muppets or especially a Kermit fan. I hope Amazon gets more of these in stock as they make good gifts too!",5
194155,"Darling print, pretty colors, and I love the snaps all the way up the front because they make it easy to put in a squirming infant. I just wish it were longer.  I love that it's made of organic materials.  That is precisely why I bought it in addition to the cute design.",4
257599,"Very disappointed, item not as described.
The coverup material looks and feels cheap.  It's shiny, not like the soft looking fabric pictured.  It is SMALL!! I wear a US size 6/8 with a small chest.  I was hoping the coverup would drape the way it does in the picture, but it made me look like I was wrapped in a sausage casing.  Unless you are uber petite and don't mind the cheap fabric, I would not recommend.",2
849512,"I was skeptical because buying clothes online can be tricky. But I LOVE this top! I am a true size 16, full up top and curvy. My biggest challenges are blouses that pucker around the button holes and that don't give the coverage I want in the rear.  This blouse is lightweight, roomy without looking too big. I will say that if you have smaller chest, you may be able to go down a size.",5
563458,I like the tricolor pattern and have worn them with the darker or lighter brown on top depending on my outfits. This option alone makes these leg warmers unique. They are very warm but not bulky and have shades of brown that are hard to find. One of my favorites!,5
509731,It is very cute it is just like the picture..the underwire however is kind of hard and hurts. But I think I should have ordered a medium instead of small. I think it runs small on the top but the bottoms fit as a small so I'm not sure. Too bad they don't let you choose different top and bottom sizes that would be great. Overall it is awesome and I will wear it a lot I imagine.,4
11444,Bought these for my son who is on his feet all day. We both have plantar faciitis & I bought a pair last year & they really helped. His arches are starting to fall & these have a very strong arch to them so I hope they help him as much as they helped me.,5
48663,"I ordered this costume for a Halloween party. I'm a bigger gal (5'5"" and 250 lbs.) and pretty busty and the shirt fit me just fine. it was comfortably loose. The sleeves were a little long but that didn't bother me. The skirt looks long enough in the front but provides NO coverage in the back and is very see through. I ended up getting leggings to go underneath. Just make sure you learn some of the cheers since you will be asked to perform!",4
475978,"The costume looks a little different than in the picture, but it did the job. It runs a little bigger than expected. I am usually between a small and a medium. I ordered the medium to be safe and it was a bit large. I should have gone with the small.",4
405754,"How do you turn the thing on or change the batteries, there is no instructions anywhere????  I looked on their website and I still cannot find anything.  It is made in China is the company from China as well?

It is easy to break these light so I am trying to be careful.",2
62568,"This fez is the best! Only beat by bowties, of course. That and fishfingers. I love this fez, and was skeptical when I first bought it, but after it came in, I was extremely satisfied. I've worn this to the Series 8 Premiere, and other things, too. It's been very good. Amy doesn't seem to like it, though.",5
470463,"This was the cutest costume EVER! I have twins and they were both lobster, while big sister was a Chef. They gathered candy with a big stock pot. It was a big hit on Halloween! I am extremely pleased with this purchase! It was true to size and fit and looked great!",5
29545,"I LOVE Evil eye jewelry & I thought this would be a nice, chunky, little piece of arm candy, however when the bracelet arrive I was extremely disappointed. It's so CHEAP looking. The eyes are actually PAINTED on the beads and some aren't even painted straight. This looks cheap & I don't recommend it.",2
33744,"I'm 5""4 125lbs. These went all the way up to the middle of my thighs and they stay but they have this weird thing where they roll into themselves on the outside of the lip at the top. Meh kind of a defect but I'll take it over them not staying up. Very comfy and very sexy. Giraffe.",4
250171,Love the adjustable feature...husband needed a shoe horn for putting his golf shoes on that was small enough to pack with his golf stuff and this fit the bill perfectly. He extends out the handle so he doesn't have to bend over completely when putting the golf shoes on and compresses small when done and stores away neatly. What more do you need?,5
185886,"This is a very cool necklace, and fit perfectly for a steampunk costume. It isn't super tight, even when on the smallest setting. Depending on your size and how you want to wear it, this could be a good or bad thing and why i rated it 4 stars. I am athletically built and it was a bit big and didn't sit flush against my neck. But i also wasn't choking all day.",4
53815,"light but protective!! My son hates wearing hats, but doesn't mind this one. I love the drawstring to size the hat-he's been wearing it from 3 month (even though it's 6 months, the drawstring allows it to be small enough-or maybe he had a big head?) and still has plenty of room now (and he's 12 months)",5
670730,"Read the reviews and made sure to order the larger size, got the xl.  They fit great and are very comfortable.  Will be ordering more in the future.  One review I read said something about the different colors fitting differently and I have found this to be true.  The white runs a little smaller than the others but not enough to cause an issue.",5
254292,"Got it for my 3 year old son who is obsessed with Vader and Kylo. It's thinner than the other plastic play lightsabers, but actually it holds up nicely during play combat (again with a 3 year old's swing). I worried that the handle, which is rather large, would be too big for my son's hands, but he holds onto it with ease and loves the light-up. The only grip I have is the plastic latch that holds the blade in place, it broke off, but not a dealbreaker.",4
317031,"While it fit and was the right size, I'm busty and the fabric in front just stopped before it covered a tiny portion of my chest. It hung awkwardly by my underarm. No fabric was stretched, it was loose around my waist and arms,  which leads me to believe it was supposed to be like that - in other words, not for busty girls.",1
86025,I ordered these pink plaid pants and the blue plaid pants. The blue plaid pants fit great but the pink pair were waaay too small. I just wish I would have known these fit different per color because I would have ordered differently. I only tried on the blue pair so i washed both pants and now it may be too late to return the pink pair.  I was very disappointed in the pink but enjoy the blue.,1
408045,"This is a great little bangle, but that's just it- it's a small bangle. If you have a large wrist, this is not the gift for you. Luckily I bought this for my future mother-in-law who has tiny wrists because I received it and after trying it on my wrist, (which I have been told is unusually small) I feared the worst. So if you have a larger build, or are buying this for a woman of larger proportions- beware, it runs small.",5
416830,"This is a really nice ring that looks modern and is very comfortable. I wore it everyday and got a lot of compliments on it. The only bad thing is that since it is stainless steel, it gets smudged and scratched easily. It's not a deal breaker, though, and I would buy this again for my daughter.",4
117833,"I love it! The fit is great and this is well made. The fabric feels petty tough and the straps on the side give you an unbelievable amount of comfort! Instead of having pants hanging off you waist by one inch of tightness, the kilt snugly fits from your belly button all the way down to your hips! Guys, if you ever thought about trying out a kilt because of the freedom it feels like, do it! You may never go back to pants again!!!",5
198137,"Though it can be a bit scratchy, it fits perfectly and the straps can adjust and you can even wear it strapless. I went a size up and got a large and everything was just the right fit! Love it! I haven't swam with it yet, but the material feels pretty good!",5
129070,"I purchased this wallet because it had 2 zipped compartments and a space in the middle for my cell phone,. has a wrist strap and perfect to put in my purse but when I do not want to carry a purse I can just grab it and go. To the store, gas station, shopping and to my daughters when I do not need a larger purse. Peace",5
36592,I love clear bubble umbrellas because you can see through them when you walk. I thought Totes would only deliver quality products but this arrived with a few tears in the plastic. The company I purchased this from immediately responded and refunded my money and I appreciate that type of customer service. They also let me keep the torn umbrella which I repaired as best I could with packaging tape.,2
339843,"Super cute tanks, but yes they Technically run small-- but just follow the size chart for an accurate fit. I usually wear Smalls or size US4, and the medium fit me well.

These tanks are sheer, but they keep cool and hug your body while you do yoga poses which is a pro! I've already gotten many compliments on them. Wish they weren't so sheer & wish the neck was a bit higher--so 4 stars.

But I would recommend!",4
45468,"I bought these hoping that they would help me re-size my ring to a size that can fit.  These do the job by keeping the ring on the finger, but the price you pay is that the part on the bottom ring will irritate your hand and your face (if you scratch), not to mention cause all other kind of issues.  My recommendation is to get tape or something and put it inside your ring to help it fit",1
239161,"Very comfortable hat! Light weight fabric, huge breathable side vents. I got this mainly to keep the rain off my face and glasses, and it does exactly that. A previous reviewer complained of the hat loosening after adjusting the fit tab, but I have not encountered that problem. There is a sliding mechanism on the latch that should keep the tab from sliding, and it works on my hat. Keeps it tight enough on my head to keep the wind from blowing it off.",5
627550,This would definitely be considered asian x-small. I am 5'2 and 100 pounds. I ordered an xs and it fit perfectly. I can even put a light sweater on underneath and it still fits. It is very fitted and feminine which I love and nice and light. I bought it as a rain coat. It looks really good on and the photo does not do it justice.,5
258711,This skirt is perfect. It's well made and the material is quality material. I'm 5ft 120lbs and luckily I read the other reviews bc buying a large when I normally wear a size 4 was the best idea. I love the way this skirt sits on my waist so nicely but I do not like how it isn't midi on my short frame. Its so long on me I look like a grandma. Besides the length though this is very nice,5
880948,"This item seems to fit OK and is cute as pictured. It is not the softest material it is more like you would expect in a slightly older baby outfit than most of what you see today.  It is not harsh or scratchy on the baby skin but it is not her favorite outfit to wear as it doesn't have the stretch and softness she is usually used to, overall this is a very cute outfit for the price.",3
367069,"Love this dress so much! Its a super light material, but is lined (light in weight--you cant see through it). Its very comfortable and fits loose and ""flowy"". I typically would order a large but I ordered an XL for length and the fit I wanted. Mom even tried it on and she loved it so much I had to order one for her too. Thanks!",5
770479,"Beautiful kimono cover up. I really loved this, but unfortunately, it started falling apart after about two months. The tassels started shedding about 1.5 months after purchase and wearing it about 10 times. I guess I can't really complain for a $10 purchase, but I wish it had lasted longer.",3
278621,"I bought these because spending $80 on name-brand sunglasses sounds like a little much. These were $10 or so, and you get what you pay for. Build quality feels cheap, but it isn't too hard to take care of sunglasses. If you are buying these for an outdoor job where you will be sweating alot, buy a different pair of glasses.",4
391784,"When I'm looking for something 100% cotton, I'm not thinking 't-shirt knit' type 100% cotton.  I just wanted a plain regular 100% cotton night gown and this is one of the problems with ordering online and not being able to feel the fabric.  Didn't see anything wrong with the gown except that it wasn't the cotton I was looking for.",2
388959,"Love this dress, I would buy more if I could find them.  I am 5'3"" 140lbs and it fit nice.  A bit tight but I need a reason to shed a few pounds. I absolutely love it and it looks great.  Sexy with heels and cute yet sexy with flats.",4
60773,Keep this in a prominent place in my prayer room and appreciate using it in daily prayers. I enjoy using the scriptures written into it as part of my prayer routine. The quality is fine and I like how it looks and feels. Its a blessing by enhancing my prayer time.,5
422328,"I am so happy that I found these earrings. I had a pair that I bought at Wal-Mart years ago. I lost one of my earrings & could now find anywhere to replace it. So I decided to use the internet. I got them within a few days & I have been wearing them ever sense.
I will always check with Amazon first before going any where else.",5
606293,"I love the looks of this purse and have gotten several compliments from people about how beautiful it is, but the quality just isn't there.  I've only had this since November but already the handles have the piping (outside the stitching) on the handles practically all peeled/ripped off and they are fraying.  Also, I think it is a tight fit getting my hand into the side pockets to put things in/take them out.",3
730532,Ordered an 18 month size and the top arrived according to the size but the pants where a size 12! Figured I'd wouldn't bother with returning it so I washed them before my baby wore them and it turned some of my clothes pink and the pj set is now a faded color. Very cheap.,1
82290,"The set is really cute.  I was hesitant about getting one that was only ""one size"" (I'm a medium petite), but it fit very well.  It is completely see-through mesh, so don't let the more modest picture fool you.  My only complaint is the smell.  It smells like it has been stored in a musty garage. Give it a wash before wearing it and it should be great.",4
67266,"I love this ring.  My husband got it for me on Mother's Day.  I love the detail and that its light weight.  When I play the piano, it stays put- love that!  It's a good fit, and good quality.  Also I like the light color of the amithist, it's very light.",5
78902,"This is not stretchable but it's okay, very shiny and the heart adds another dimension of beauty and rarity to a standard anklet.  I have not given it to anyone yet.  I am saving it for another occasion, and it is a little better than two other anklets I ordered.",3
9188,"Never wore slip-ons as a daily shoe, having said that these are fantastic. Very clean, minimalist look to them with no BS; these are just simple slip-ons. Comfortable as well but I had to had some thin insoles because Vans skimp out on theirs. Definitely gonna buy again when these wear out.",4
186570,"I used the sizing chart and even ordered a size a little smaller because I like a tight fit, I'm glad I did this because it was still a little big. The other issue I had was with the front clasps, when I sat down they kept coming undone. I do like the product though.",5
457299,My daughter placed these sunglasses on her Christmas wish list from another seller. I chose Eyewear USA because the other seller had mixed reviews and questions if their products are genuine Ray Ban glasses. Eyewear USA delivered the genuine Ray Ban product at the last minute before Christmas and my daughter loves them. I'm told they're men's sunglasses but they look great on her.,5
497807,"I've received lots of compliments on this shirt. I love the style - it can be worn with jeans or dress slacks.  I'm 5'8"" and weigh 155 lbs. and the size L fits perfectly.  I've washed it inside-out on gentle cycle and laid it flat to dry.  It didn't shrink and still looks like new. I might buy another one.",5
74644,"stockings are super cute and of great quality. I am 5' and about 100 lbs, and they go where I want them to go, which is a good thing for a short girl; however, the socks don't feel very stretchy and tall girl should consider about the length before buying. I love them!!",5
556812,"It came in a small rectangular shape package which was a bit weird compared to other was of packging one usually encounters. The sweatshirt as its self looks nice, but the other reviewer was correct when he/she said that it was thin. It's not exactly like a long-T, it has a bit more to it but yes it's thin. If your buying it foor the looks then it will be a great purchase, just make sure you CHECK THE SIZE.",4
409177,"I've always heard that you get what you pay for, but with this ring you get way more.  It's absolutely stunning and it stands up to the abuse that real men will put it through.

This ring looks exactly like a 300 dollar tungsten ring that you would find in a jewelry shop.

I'm very happy with my purchase.

You won't be disappointed...",5
110793,"Okay, so I love the idea of this necklace but I hated the color... So I used some metallic light blue nail polish and painted the ugly yellow rose, and now I love the necklace! I recommend buying this because it's really a good piece for the price, but I would never wear it in the color it came in. So if you don't like the color, just paint it!",4
671840,This scarf is really light and Breezy. I didn't want a scarf that I felt like I was choking behind or bunched up in my face. This scarf gives me coverage at my chest and accents my tops without that bulk and weight. I've also used it as a headband and it works well that way too.,5
461002,I own a Colorado licence plate purse from 10 years ago it was getting wore out like the rubber on the snap so I decided I would get one of the state I live in and they are of the same quality which is nice to know I love this purse so much and get so many compliments on it im glad to own 2 now,5
74834,I got a 2. I'm a size 12 pre-pregnancy and it fits perfect! What I really love about this band is that it has a rubber lining at the bottom of one side so it actually sticks in place! This far surpasses any other belly band I've purchased! So happy I can continue to wear my pre-preg jeans!,5
765348,"I love the look of this suit! I went with an XL after reading reviews that it ran small. I wear a medium usually. I'm 5-6' 150lbs. The top is a bit big but not too big. I usually wear a 32DD. And the bottoms cut in a bit because I have bigger thighs but if you're more slender it will look great on you! I will for sure be rocking this suit this summer!

I received this item at a discount for my honest view",4
333536,"I bought these for my 2 year old and he loves them.  He is a big kid, so I bought 3t and they fit him perfectly.  He hasn't had an accident in them, but for those 'gotta-go-now' dribbles they've been great.  And he's thrilled that he gets to wear big boy undies like his big bro.",5
464208,"For as cheap as it is this is a great costume. The stitching was coming apart a little at the seem of one of the thumbs but otherise it was great.

One thing to note is that this costume runs small. I am just under 5'7 and normally where either a medium or a small, but this costume was exceptionally tight on me. I fit into it, but if I was going to order it again I would get a large.",4
165131,"Good pair of inexpensive leggings. The material is not very shiny which I like. I wore them on several longer runs and they stay up well and I didn't have any issues with them rubbing. They are not see through when I bend over.  Great for casual wear, hiking or running.",5
615006,I bought this bag from DSW shoe store. My aunt loved it so much that she asked me to order one for her as well. I have had mine for about a year and I have no negative feed back at all. It is vegan approved and I love that part too. It is not a cheap made back. I love the inside as well. This bag is a plus the only thing I noticed is the brand is sold cheaper in the store most of the time.,5
165723,For all of the bloggers raving they're just like Lulu leggings...not a chance. They were so stiff and came with a chemical odor. One bend or yoga pose and they were immediately see through. I returned them - there's a reason Lulu comes with a steep price tag. They're worth it!,2
451245,"This is no where near a dress but I expected that. I'm 5'9"" and this maybe goes mid butt. Its definitely more of a tunic style top to be worn with leggings. I ordered the purple topy for a cinco de mayo themed party and it will be a perfect fit for the occasion.",4
637669,"when you get the dress, it's really fast shipping. I got I three days after I confirmed the order. And it looks just like the photo, but what you need to keep in mind is that you have to buy a size bigger than you usually buy. And even the returning process is fast too, just go to your local UPS and they know what to do. This dress was really worth it. It only got four stars cause of the sizing.",4
532817,"This was a purchase for my son to wear to his daughter's 50's Sock-Hop Birthday Party.  Size XL fit exactly as expected.  And, all the Two-and-a-Half Men jokes aside, he actually REALLY liked this shirt.  It is made well.  Dry cleaning is recommended,, but I washed in a laundry bag on delicate cycle, dried flat, and it came out just fine.  This is a substantial fabric, not a ""silky"" silk.",5
264822,"Cute dress but runs very small. I ordered a medium(small frame and 135lbs/slim) and I could not get the zipper to go up.
I will pass it down to my step daughter and not even try to return for a bigger size. Sorry it could not fit me because its really a
nice dress. Material tight, but otherwise it is a very nice dress. The sizing chart is just very wrong.",3
404555,I was very excited when I recieved this ring in the mail. Very beautiful. My only concern is that I wear a 5.5 and there aren't half sizes so I went with a 6. The ring itself is slightly heavy so it always falls to the side on my finger. Also the set has nothing to keep the two ring pieces together so they often seperate to opposite sides. With the second (smaller) ring having curvature to the main piece makes it very noticable when its not together in the right spot.,4
712465,I absolutely love the jumper however i had to get it hem and my hips and butt was to big for the zipper. I ordered a medium b/c I wear a 10 but If i got a bigger size it would have been to big in the bust  and I'm a 36D. I did manage to wear it to a wedding though and got a lot of complements,3
611715,I luv these panties... very happy with the way they look and fit..shipping was faster than expected date. they are fully closed front to bottom.. and show off a perfect view in the back. For the price.. very happy with the material and comfort. I bought the red ones.. and will be buying more colors soon. I bought many different panties to try... these are one of my new favorites hands down.. can't wait to show them off.. and look forward to putting the open back to a good long over nite session!,5
27078,"I'd previously used Powerstep Orthotics that I received at my Podiatrist's office and wondered if these would be as good. Trust me, you won't know the difference. Very comfortable, and provide the support for people with foot issues such as myself. I use custom orthotics while I'm at work, but for work around the house and golf these provide plenty of support.",5
144987,"These tights are so cute, and they fit really well. I would highly recommend these to a friend. Since the shipping takes a little while, I would buy them well in advance to the event you'd like to wear them to. They arrived in time for me, but I was stressing a bit.",5
749813,"Very reasonably priced. Well made. Fits true to size. I wish the battery lasted longer, but it gets pretty warm when it's fully charged. Heat panels are in the front, back, and neck area. Also, the jacket has built spandex hand covers with thumb holes (I've been told this is typical of a ski jacket) which is a very nice feature and allows me to merge the jacket seamlessly with gloves.  Overall, I LOVE this jacket and have gotten a lot of questions/compliments on it.",5
543249,"I love this shirt, although it said to size up and I did and it turned out a little big but it still looks really cute! It's snug at the bottom too. And it's kinda see through if you're out in a bright place but otherwise you can't really see anything.",5
501588,"This dress is not the same color as the pic, it is not as full or flare  at the bottom.  It is more straight at the bottom. It is not what I expected. I ordered it to wear to a wedding, but it is not dress up quality. It is very plain.  I wear a 12 and ordered a large.  Top was roomy.  I am 5'7'' and the dress was short, just below my knees.  I will keep the dress because it is wearable but I am disappointed.",2
275170,I purchased this item on a recommendation of a friend of mine.  This belt is awesome.  I was hesitant on buying a belt with a removable buckle as in the past these have failed to hold up.  This belt is nice.  I can wear it with both dress pants and jeans.  The ease in adjusting to my waist is nice and the smaller increments make it perfect.,5
261106,"This dress was way too small - not at all comparable with US sizes. Also it's made of a very thin quality material that probably would not stand up to a washing machine. When I requested a refund, I got a few sporadic responses offering different sizes, and finally an international address via email to ship to. This is not on par with amazons return policy for international sellers. Buyer beware!",1
723837,"I love this shirt, I'm going to buy one in every color.  I am a week and a half away from my due date, and have been trying to get comfortable this entire pregnancy.  Finally found a shirt that is A. Inexpensive B. Fits well over my belly (I ordered a medium) and C. Actually looks nice.  I ordered a small the first time, saving that one for after I give birth.",5
403008,"Bought this bag to use for pool exercise class. Holds two beach towels..pool shoes  hair dryer,wallet  and more. Even a seperate compartment for emergency snack...I'm diabetic and kidney transplant survivor. Fits perfect in  locker  standing on its side. Easy clean.  Luv  Luv  Luv",5
267756,"I am the first person to write a review for this watch, so when I purchases this I ordered it with know idea whether or not it would be reliable. So here is my review: I love this watch!  It is definitely waterproof, I have gone swimming with it on, and it looks exactly how it does in the picture. I love the colors, and the hands glow in the dark. Highly recommended.",5
394082,"This is a great shirt.  Arrived swiftly ahead of schedule.  Looks exactly as depicted.  Great material that fits in accordance with sizing instructions.  Poly/Cotton blended fabric hasn't shrunk when washed and dried and ""breathes"" nicely.  I like it so much will probably order the same shirt in another color.  Thanks!",5
400430,"I love these versatle scarf hat. I have given them to all my girls and they adore them. they are warm!  even if you don't have a heavy coat, you stay warm with this around your neck or head.  i have had people stop me to ask where to get them.  You will love it!",5
638477,"Very pretty, fits great, and super comfortable. As a 34-DD, I've struggled all my life to find a decent bra that provides adequate support and doesn't feel like a straightjacket or look like something a scary nun might wear. I love this brand, and I am so thankful that I no longer have to struggle with the hideous, unfeminine, uncomfortable nightmares that characterized my youthful lingerie pursuits. I just put this on and GO. Nailed it at a fantastic price as well!",5
659583,The front of the bag was black and purple. The straps and rest of the bag was a very very ugly brown. Not only did the black and brown not match it was again a very ugly brown. Horrible combination. And since the bag came from China it would cost me more than bag did to return it .  Trust me. I checked because I was going to send it back. Now I am stuck with it,1
277715,"The material was soft and felt like good quality, but the sizing was too big. I am a 33"" waist, so I purchased a Large. I should have purchased a Medium. Will need to return it. Also, it's very long in the torso and pushes my bra up when I sit down. If I try to pull it down before sitting, it causes it to make a large roll accross the abdomen. Not attractive.",3
389811,"Worst briefs ever.  Not true to size, Turn out to be 55 percent cotton, not 91 percent advertised.  Inside construction is bizarre.  It may hold together, but it looks like it was made from scraps.  The worst feature is one that was in the advert--more than inch-high Fruit of the Loom lettering on the wide and uncomfortable waistband.  An awful product with deceptive advertising",1
449183,"Like many mentioned, the coin is a lot bigger than the image or any regular coin. It is also not gold-ish and green in color, but bronze and blackish. Nonetheless it looks great and it feels like an original. I like it, I would have preferred it prefer it to be green, but for the price and the quality as well as the message it holds, it is a great find. I took a star out because the picture did not match the actual bagua. TY.",4
367286,"What a great handbag set!  These three bags all work together - the small wallet size fits into the crossbody bag which then fits into the large bag.  You can take the trio, and use the crossbody when shopping, traveling, or just want this ease of movement.  For a short trip, I get out the small bag, which is big enough for my wallet and credit cards.  I have gotten several compliments on style and print of these bags.  I got this for travel, and I  believe it is the perfect set for this.",5
529449,"Fabulous dress, the fit was just right, I usually wear a medium, so ordered a large on the advise of the size chart and it was a perfect fit. The dress is well made and the fabric is very nice, not at all flimsy or see through. The elastic back really helps make it a perfect fit! Will order more soon!",5
555534,"It smells horrid for some reason so I'll need to wash it but I tried it on and it fit perfect.  I'm six feet tall so the legs may be long on you if you're on the short side. Another important thing you should know is ~ hand wash only in cold water.  You can't put this in a washer or dryer...so for those of you looking to save time, this wouldn't be for you. :)",4
53719,"Bought this for my son (10 months old) to keep the sun off of his very fair skin. I like the large brim that goes all the way around and it seemed to fit his head nicely! Unfortunately, our dog chewed it up, so I will have to get another! I do wish it had a pull string vs. a tie string to keep the hat on, but overall I like the product.",4
480063,Wow. I love this wallet. I am very organized and this wallet allowed me to do this. it had plenty of card slots and other little pockets for organizing. The outer one provides easy access to the most used cards and id and the zipper portion keeps everything locked in. It is not to huge but big enough for me to put my note 3 in and still zip it up so i don't have to carry them both around. The price was great and I honestly didn't expect this wallet to be this great for what I paid.,5
52006,"This is a godsend, as most of my hats leave a red mark on my forehead.  The hat stretcher has done wonders to shape them to fit me FAR better!  If your hats are too 'round' (apparently it's a common problem with wool top hats?) this will DEFINITELY make them fit you FAR better!",5
222845,"It looks very similar to the image but It is obviously cheaply made, The Ears do not look that pretty as in the image. It came in super early by three weeks - WHICH IS AMAZING:D I didn't think I would get it before Halloween:) but you get what you paid for so for how much I paid it's not terrible",3
550568,"Love love love this bubble necklace! It's a light pink necklace with just enough bubble. Most of the other bubble necklaces were much too gaudy for my taste.

883614,"Really cute dress. I bought a small and medium and had to return both because they didn't close at all in the front chest area. I am waiting for the large and keeping my fingers crossed it fits right. The dress is so flattering. I usually ware a medium, so I would suggest a size up for the navy color.",3
671724,"I bought these for my 11 month old girl to ride on the plane.  I read that these would be easier than pants to change her diaper on the plane.  But the leggings barely fit on her thighs, maybe she's just a chunky monkey.  She didn't even wear them because the plane (Jetblue) was so hot.  Still cute, wish they were all cotton.",3
556576,"I LOVE LOVE LOVED this coat. The material was nice, the colors were great, unfortunately it was TOO small... :(  I am usually a size Med/Large, wear a size 8/9 in pants.

When I finally saw it I could see they were the same color (two golds) so they couldn't make the heart. I contacted the seller and explained what happened but they didn't do anything about it. Not sure how or why that went wrong, but the quality was good and it looks almost exactly like the picture.",2
419525,"Well, I bought this chain to go with my pendant. It looked shiny and expensive
when it arrived but only after 3 days the color started to fade. Obviously you cant
wear a gold pendant with a faded chain. I don't understand how does it say ""14 karat gold plated"", when it cant even stand 3 days. It was really cheap when I bought it but including the
shipping cost ,I guess I could have got a lot more. Any how its exactly what the price says about it and no gold plated..!!!",1
342183,Great earrings for the cost. If your ears are newly pierced then it may take a little bit of effort to get them in. The rods are a little bit bigger than what most people get their ears pierced with. So far I have had no adverse reactions and I rotate which ones I wear throughout the week.,5
827515,"I was very impressed when these glasses arrived. They were packed securely and I felt as though I had ordered glasses costing hundreds of dollars!  The case is high quality, the glasses were in a cloth bag, there was a free lint cloth and even a tiny glasses repair screw driver on a keychain!  The glasses themselves fit securely, perfectly block glare and look wonderful. I will definitely order from this company again!",5
765971,"This mask worked out great. It looked just as good as the pictures. When I pulled it out of the packaging, I thought it would be too small, but when I tried it on it fit much better than I had expected. I received this product at a discount in return for my honest review.",5
598738,Too much of an orange color.  I was expecting more of a soft peach as the photo shows.  Sleeves are kind of annoying because they're in between a 3/4 length and full length.  This is going back.  I'm usually a medium in tops but this is somewhat big.  I probably could get away with a small.,3
98957,I purchased this bag 2 years ago and its still in excelent condition. It holds so much stuff. I fit a hoodie and all the regular everyday items a girl carries in a purse.  My only complaint is the cross body strap is too short. Other than that its a great bag. The color is beautiful.n,5
112157,"Bought it on a whim. Appears to be decent quality for the price. No copper smell and when I initially cleaned it no reside. Connecting the string ends is a plastic ball that makes adjustments easy. At this early phase can't comment on reliability but a cool looking piece.

Good Luck.",5
349200,"This ring is gorgeous and well made. I get loads of compliments on it when I wear it. It is a larger piece then I'm used to and I'm not sure it's practical for everyday use for myself, but I will definitely be wearing it any time I want to wear dressier jewelry.  It was very comfortable to wear, but  large enough that it touches my bottom lip, so I was almost always aware of it.",5
167850,"I like the 90 degrees brand and am very happy with these pants. They are not see through and fit great. They are long (almost to my ankle and I'm 5'3"") -- just something to keep in mind if you like shorter capris. I like these for lifting, but prefer shorter leggings for cardio days.",4
764045,"This shirt has a terrible chemical smell but can be washed.  I got the large so that it would fit. I usually wear a small in American sizes.  But if you are busty at all this shirt is not going to work. It was fine everywhere else, but looked absolutely horrible around the bust.",2

I can find it easily in my purse due to the shiney metallic.",5

The Filas are about half the price of the cotton Injinjis and they look more durable. They also wick away sweat better and aren't as soggy after wearing them. Overall I think I prefer the wool Injinjis but they are expensive and don't last very long.

I also have some Angelina toe socks that work fine for walking around that are a lot cheaper than these. I like them both.",5
572505,This scarf is great. I bought it for my mom and she loves it. I expected them to be longer but i personally like long scarves. The colors are very vibrant and nice. And to the reviews that says its not warm...it's pashmina. Those people don't know what a pashmina is. It's supposed to be very thin and silky.,5
412876,"The ring is NOT a orangery-red like this picture shows (should have read the other reviews before I bought it). It's lighter, more a salmon color. It has a good weight and it looks good enough for the price, but the ""stone"" piece popped off within the first 5 minutes I had it on. I can probably glue it back on but seriously, what's up with that? Also the ring size is smallish - the size 7 is closer to a 6.",1

You feel like you are walking on a mattress instead of the firm sole the 759 had.

603354,Just no. This bathing suit is inexpensive for a reason. Do not waste the $5. It is not even worth that. If I had to guess on size I would say it is probably a small.

He wears them all the time and brings them when he comes to our house, and they look so cute with the robe and slippers that we,(his Papa and I ) got him for Christmas.  We love buying him things, as he is an adorable platinum haired 5 year old, who brings us so much joy!  I searched all over for slippers, and finally found those, and knew they would be perfect, and they were!!",5
240057,"I ordered this ring for myself (female).  I wanted a wide-ish band and this ring was perfect width.  It's a very good looking ring, true to size and appeared to be very good quality.  It felt a little too heavy for my preference so I am returning it.  Had it not been for the slightly heavier weight I would certainly have kept it.",5
389758,"New flash guys have been designed the same since the beginning. But somehow guys underwear still look the same as ladies some despite pretty obvious differences.  No extra fabric, no pleats, no tucks.  How's that supposed to be usable let alone comfortable? Don't settle guys.  You should expect more from your underwear. You wouldn't buy a hammock you couldn't sit in, would you? Go with someone who knows how to design men's underwear.  Try 2(X)IST for example.",1
705771,These run small and that may be due to the corduroy fabric. It is not as stretchy as the other Pajama Jeans fabrics have been. This is my 5th paid of Pajama Jeans (first in the corduroy) and if I'll likely not order the corduroy version again. They also seem to be shorter in the inseam and I'll be letting down the hem on them before I wear them again.,3
224965,"In many ways I really like this bag.  It has the best configuration of places to put things - extremely well designed in that manner.  BUT the material used is very stiff and inflexible, so it makes it hard to access things.  It is also not soft to the touch. Also the strap is too wide and the way it is attached with the rectangular metal bracket allows the strap to move and then it gets bunched - would be much better if they used a round ring.",2
387204,"Somewhat disappointed. While high quality, well made and heavy-duty it was less than half the size of a standard dogtag or other similar dog tag style jewelry. That said it'll do it's job and let EMTs know about my existing condition(s) and in the end that's all I truly care about.",4
467830,This was not at all what I wanted.  I had to wait several weeks for it to arrive from China only to find there was only one earring in the pouch and it wasn't even the color shown in the picture or a post earring.  I am very disappointed and I feel I wasted my money.,1
88593,"once its scratch its a staying for good. the shades it self was great but when i ordered a second one they gave me a slighly different one. One that does not look like whats on display on this page. Not so sure if i did something wrong, but over all its ok.",3
442200,I bought this for my husband for his wedding ring. We looked all over and saw this on amazon for 15 and couldn't pass it up. It is the same ring we saw in big jewelry stores just a whole lot cheaper. The ring has some weight too it. It took my husband about a week to get used to it. It is great. doesn't scratch or dent and my husband works with his hands a lot. I highly recommend this ring!,5

I am gonna use it anyway after I will loose some weight after pregnancy. It is seems well made, fabric is soft and a cute pattern. I like how it is supports breasts and gives a nice shape. Overall it is a nice bra but runs small.",4
592912,It was really cute but gave me really bad armpit fat and I don't know how that's possible I'm a 34B never happened before lol. The bottoms I felt were too tall and were too tight so they became almost see through. It's so cute but I returned it because I was disappointed in how I felt in it.,3
14542,"LOVE THESE! I didn't realize I had low arches until I took a test right before buying these. I didn't even have to break these in. I wore them to the gym and could not have been more comfortable. I've worn them to Disneyland in my boots, 2-days in a row working an athletic event, and repeatedly to the gym. I first had them in my Nikes and now have them in my new Asics Duomax. The woman who helped me has been working in athletic shoes for years and said it was a ""pretty well-made orthotic.""",5
790902,"These pants are even more beautiful in person! The flowy legs and lightweight fabric will be perfect for summer. The small is a little bit big in the waist (I am 5'5"", 105 lbs), but they should be fine. I can't wait to wear them, and I'm already planning to order another pair in a different color!",5
41394,"I am a yoga addict myself so I purchased some pairs of this kind lately. I try these socks everyday when I go to the class. I like them better so far compare with other brands because they don't run on the mat like the others. The material is not so great. I don't know how they will look like after washing a few times; otherwise, I will give them five stars. However, with this price I think it's worth while.",4

They fit perfect are authentic Vans and are great slip on casual shoes last a long time. Be confident in buying these are classic shoes that are built for all day use.",5

The last pair of iKingsky thongs I bought, I went one size larger (based on review comments) and they were way too big. It's a little frustrating the sizes aren't consistent across styles from the same company. But I still like them and would purchase them again even though it's a bit of a crap shoot as to whether the size will be ideal or not.",4
67837,I love this bag.  It is a moderate size that carries a lot of stuff. All well organized by the zippered compartments.  Nothing is falling out of this bag! This is my third one of these.  I've been using this bag for quite a few years now and love it. I wear the color off before the bag is really in sad shape itself.  Maybe it I thought to throw on a coat of shoe polish once in a while.  I use this bag exclusively!,5
745338,It is a bit small. This is a plus and a minus as it fits better and takes up less space. However it could be just a little bit bigger and it would accommodate everything I need. Other bags I have had zip from both sides. This only has a single zipper.,3
499558,"I just received mine today, & it does give me an incredible lift & makes my boobs look really good. :) It is a bit tight, but I think that added to the lift. I would give an additional star if it wasn't for the Chinese writing on the tag, but I can look past it.",4
97904,This shirt is soft and comfortable to wear.  It does not hang as low on the body as the picture suggests and the shoulders lay more off the shoulders on me.  I have pretty broad shoulders so this surprised me.  Very slow shipping but they warned of that ahead of time.  I ordered 2 different shirts from the same company at the same time and this one came in more then a week later.,4
255153,"I'm a 24.5 inch waist and a Small fit perfect! It was however, sewn crooked, so I'll be ordering another to see if it's any better. The front closures are hard to use but it's just for a costume, so I'm not complaining.  I wouldn't recommend it for waist training or long term wear, but it's great for a cosplay/event. I'd also advise being at least a B cup, as this will stand away from you if you're not.

Edit: Got a new bustier, this one is sewn correctly. Great for a costume!",4
217366,"This is a BIG hat in more ways than one. First of all it is very wide. Great for keeping the sun off your neck, but it is also big in size. One size fits all is not always true if you have a small head. I wear a size 7 1/4 and this hat came down over my ears.",3
323712,"I don't care that these are cashmere other than that they can only be dry cleaned.  What I do love about these is that most of the ones I found were much bulkier than these.  These are thin and smooth.  Perfect for what I was looking for.  There is a slight defect on the edge of one of them.  I'm not super picky.  I think they appear to be made well...but again, I'm not that picky.  I've attached pics...including one of the ""defect.""",5

This was not the case when I tried these socks, I will tell you I am impressed, my feet do not sweat as much as they did before, the feel of the sock is very comfortable and after a walk my feet do not feel as bad at they normally would.  Now what more can you ask for.  The only improvement would be a lower price.",5
870423,"I have issues with sun and have to stay covered up. Hence, the purchase of this hat.
First, the things I love about this hat:
1. It's beautiful.
2. It's reversible.
3. It's made well, and of high quality fabric.
The things I don't like:
1. It's huge. Seriously. It would fit the biggest headed NFL lineman.
2. Because it's so huge, when my 17 year old son saw it on me, he said, ""Please never wear that in public.",3
187680,"It's pretty, but tinier than expected. I'm 5""7, and the belt portion of the skirt hits me right below the bust,  but the skirt is nice and long, and falls to about mid-thigh. The waist of the skirt is elastic, but again, pretty small! I would peg this at about a US size 8 tops? Too small for me, but a nice design and good materials and construction!!",3
697421,"What I received was exactly what I was expecting. Seemed to be made with good quality. The reason for 3 stars is the size of the two openings. They are pretty small, so before buying, make sure your sunglasses have relatively small ends or else you'll have trouble trying to force them into the two openings.",3
467210,"I just received this in the mail today. The way they packaged the necklace in a very skinny shrink-wrap plastic all folded over destroyed the feather. I literally opened it and chunks of the feather fell off. The folded the feather at a 90 degree angle and then backwards to fit in the tiny shrink wrap. I can't even wear it. I'll post a picture of it too.
I'd return it, but shipping back to China would be 10x the cost of the actual necklace. What a waste. Don't buy.",1

354117,"I tried the more expensive version first, but it is definitely sized for smaller wrists. This bracelet is perfect if you need a larger bracelet. So if you ordinarily buy bracelets to fit an 8"" wrist, this will work. It looks terrific, and because it's stainless steel it can handle a busy, active, lifestyle, which suits me perfectly.",5
645256,ok I finally put this on fits a little snug wish it came in an extra extra large.  No really cut for Africian american women who has bumps in some places.  overall nice snug fit.  Fabric color great and fabric feel good not stratchy like some fabric give it a 7 out of 10.,4
74686,"This are nice tights, but they certainly run on the big side....they're too long even for some girls with a size 6, leaving so much room to fill that even after pulling them up to yor chest, there's still room left to fill with the only alternative of bunching them up around your things, hoping the dress will cover the mess, then pulling them up all night as you walk and they slip down to reveal your little oversized tights problem. I did not use them, not for that hassle.",3
30512,"The 4 stars were only because I do not give 5 for just about anything, so that is the best most will get from me. These fit perfectly,  they feel very well made and no big box store will match this from price to the Amazon shipping. I've ordered two more pair, that is how satisfied I am with the purchase.",4
80456,This dress for me is so so. The material is so thin you can see your panties. Even a thong. I'm 5'2 and it drags the ground so you can't even see the pattern. I just wear it around the house. I've never worn it out because its so sheer and I'm not wearing a slip for a sun dress,2
237802,The blue is a little brighter than the picture--more of a sapphire color--which is very pretty. Also the cups are very small and there is no way to hold them in place so the underwires don't stay where they should. It would probably work better for someone with a smaller bust (I am 34 DD). But the material is nice and it held up well in the washer and dryer.,4
13827,"I originally bought these for better support wearing my casual shoes (Clarks/superstars). However, even with the soles taken out, they raise my feet way too high within the shoes! It either constricts my feet or has my heels almost falling out the back of the shoes.

The saving grace was that they worked fine in my basketball shoes. However, I would think twice before getting these for your regular, casual shoes.",3
68731,I'm not very happy with how these are holding up. My son has worn them in the pool maybe ten times and the fabric at the toe is ripped and the soles are very worn. Do not expect to use them for more than one summer! They do stay on and do the job of protecting his feet so I will give them two stars for that but I was expecting much better quality.,2
730346,"Just got my pillow and I love it. I was a little worried because I had seen some reviews for other very similar products and they had been received broken. I didn't see any reviews for this particular one so I decided to go ahead and order it. I'm very glad I did, it is very nice and actually a little bit bigger that I was expecting. It goes perfectly with the bridesmaids bouquets. I would definitely recommend this product.",5

NOPE! They came in broken, yet again! Not wasting my money on these again. To those of you that received them in great condition, you're the lucky ones.",1
328891,"Very cute suit for the price!! Bottom fits perfectly , and top also but tends to move so you can maybe pop out depending on your bust size. I wouldn't recommend for busty  women or you'll be busting out of this top. Material is really nice, so is the pattern. Great suit for the price",4
807702,"This shirt is lovely. It looks so great on my husband and it fits him wonderfully. No need for tailoring with the cut of the shirt. I was worried the accents would look cheap, but they don't.

My husband reports that the fabric is soft and light. A great looking shirt!",5
445251,"I bought it with many doubts but I'm satisfied with the purchase. The color is the same as in the picture. The fabric is thick enough to protect from the cold but not something you can compare to a jacket of course. It fit perfectly the small size, I'm a size 0 but someone bigger could wear it too.",5
426461,"This is a perfect gift for October birthday girls.  The pendant design is delicate, yet, it is sturdy enough to wear every day.  This product was shipped on time on the early side and packaged well.  The gift box is pretty, too. I'm really happy with this purchase!  I also had to contact customer service for something I had over-looked and they are very friendly and extremely helpful. I recommend this company and this pendant.",5
269549,"The first one of these -- same brand -- I bought (over a year ago) had a poor quality zipper that caught a lot and finally broke. I liked the size of it, so I gave the company/brand another shot. This one is lovely, with nice zippers and I am pleased with it.",3

We have asked for the seller to correct the item. If the seller satisfies our expectations and delivers the product advertised we will write a new review.",1
18646,This brand runs big. I have two of these hats; one with the large brim which is great for the park and I also have the one with the fabric along the back of the neck. My daughter is a little small for her age but she is a year and a half and she fits great in the 18 month size hat. Both of the styles I have are adjustable and fit her great. I highly recommend these hats they are wonderful fabric and durable in the washer.,3
627059,I received this amazingly adorable dress at a discounted price in return for my honest review. This dress really is adorable and so very flattering! The material is incredibly soft and lays just perfectly. This dress is also so versatile as you could dress it up and wear it to a wedding but it can also be worn casually w/o looking over dressed. This is a perfect addition to anyone's closet.,5
221777,"Love these sunglasses!!  They are kind of soft plastic, very comfortable and cute, and fit my 11 year old daughter perfectly! She's kind of a small person anyway, but they fit my 6 year old son too.  We've had such a hard time finding tween style sunglasses that aren't too big for her face, but aren't too babyish with cartoon characters on them. These are perfect!",5
190293,This was by far the most sorry piece of fabric I've ever purchased in my life.  I wish i could get my money back.  I absolutely regret even looking at this pic expecting that's what I'd get in the mail. Not to mention it rides up when you walk!,1
377694,"Love the shirt but it's huge! Based on the description I ordered a medium, but if I had to reorder, I'd want an extra small! I am 5'8 and 140 lbs, just had a baby so not looking for anything very tight... all that to say, medium is still huge!",4
649404,I bought this because my baby doesn't love being swaddled and I love the halo sleep sack but wanted something really easy to put him in for sleep. This is amazing....so soft and warm enough for sleep. I love that it can be a sleep sack and it makes changing a breeze. The little scratch mittens are an added bonus. I got the 0-3 month size and he's almost 8lbs and it fits really nice with room to grow. I will definitely be buying another one.,5
854256,"I love this bag! I love these backpack style bags, because they are convenient to carry and harder to steal. I love all the pockets, and it has a lot more room then it appears to. I love the denim-like design, and it seems incredibly durable. The zippers are high-quality, so I don't think they will ever get messed up or fall off. I think this will last a long time.",5
356540,Very pretty swimming suit! I got the xxxL and I'm 5'8 and 260 pounds and it was a little bit small but I can still wear it just fine and it's very stretchy so I'm not too worried. If I would reorder I would get a size bigger but im still very satisfied with it!,4
396498,"I purchased this bag, because I liked the look, and if had a lot of good reviews. The reviews never failed me. I love it. It is the perfect size, and I didn't even have to adjust the strap. Lots of pockets, and the inside liner is a light color, which makes it easier to find things. Good quality, and the blue with the gray is lovely. Arrived on time.",5
491136,"When I first got it, I had to lie on the bed and let my husband snap me in. It was very tight at first. Either I got smaller over night or I was bloated the first time I put it on. I love it because I can wear it to workout in and I can wear it during the day.",4
799350,I ordered this two sizes larger than I normally wear and it is still small. The sleeves are not as long as they are shown and I have large thighs and these were very tight around my thighs. If it had fit better than I think this would look amazing. The material is similar to a thermal sweater but a little thinner. Overall I love this but only wish I ordered it three sizes larger. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.,5
820286,"I bought this bathing suit in a small and what I got was something COMPLETELY different from the picture, and it is a size medium. The top has two separate pieces with two odd holes in each peice, it's a completely useless ""bathing suit"" I'm also upset that a star rating is required for me to post a review because this deserves no stars, it's not at all what I paid for",1
800381,"I ordered a L in black. I'm 142 lbs, 5' 4"" and 36C. I love the lace. It's soft and comfortable. This pic is with a push-up bra.

268336,"I don't typically write reviews but I had to for this item because i was so irritated by the fact that when I finally decided to take it out the package and use it this weekend the zipper keep getting stuck and finally yesterday the zipper broke.  So I basically wasted $19.99.  I order another in blue one from another make ""YALUXE Women's Large Capacity Leather Wristlet"" and this one works great.",1
102528,"I personally like a heavier cotton fabric in my tees. These are mediocre, thin fabric, moderately priced - hence the 3 stars. If that is your preference, these are fine. If you are looking for a heavier cotton crew neck tee, try the Hanes Beefiy 6.1 oz. Sizes are as described, shrinkage minimal in these heavier tees. They have a great color selection and are priced a little more, but definitely worth it.",3
430555,"The beads are very nicely shaped and polished, the correct number, and it looks nice.  It works well for the purpose, has 108 beads.  The six sided prayer wheel, however, is a bit disappointing (should have eight sides).

759369,"My wife (5'3"" 110lbs) seems to really like this.  It is nothing fancy, but for the price it is great as something she can throw on really quick if we are going for a walk or she needs something to wear around the house.  It does look a bit looser on her than the model, but it still seems to fit her well.",5
726469,"I was given a pair of gloves a little like these years ago as a gift from a friend and loved them but lost them. They are great for winter and jazz up an outfit when you're on a date because the fur. But it's also comfortable. These I like better. They are really soft and very comfortable to wear, anywhere! They're made well and I haven't had any issues so far. So adorable that I'll probably be buying another pair in a different color. I love how many colors they come in too.",5
688559,Absolutely love this dress. It is gorgeous and fits beautifully. The style is very elegant and flattering. I ordered the burgundy and it was true to color. Very well made. I did have to have it altered for length because it runs really long (which I guess is good for taller women). Overall I am very happy with this purchase.,5
178358,"My 2 month old daughter looks very pretty in this outfit. She gets a lot of compliments when she wears this. The frilly skirt is soft and really beautiful. It's nice that it comes with a matching cute headband. The onesie's polkadot design is also very pretty. I like the fabric, too which is soft and comfy. Everything is well-made and this looks so much better than the branded ones. My daughter is only 2 months (14 lbs.), I bought the size for 3 months and it fits her like a glove. Recommended!",5
112133,These are way too large for an infant. They might fit a 2-3 year old with a large head. I expected these to be a little cheap looking because they are so inexpensive but these are really really cheap. I gave them too stars because I was able to return them.,2
87976,"The sewing on this costume was less than stellar.  They were so cheap on the chest ribbon, that they pieced it together instead of using one longer piece.  The laces look as though they should be used on a hefty basketball shoe.  The burgandy fabric was nice for the price, but the sewing left much to be desired.",1
384092,"I couldn't find sunglasses to fit my baby anywhere. They were always too big. I'm so glad I came across these!

531540,"NOT WORTH THE MONEY! BUYER BEWARE! Nearly all the stones came OFF! And I didn't even bang my wrist onto anything! It's also getting rusty, as if the silver paint is coming off. It actually leaves my wrist a funny color so I had to stop wearing it. I thought it would look cute with my Michael Kors watch and it did but for a few days. AWFUL product! Asking for a refund...",1
167351,"These are very comfy, with a somewhat smooth-feeling (but not shiny-slick!) fabric that is tightly woven, but light-weight. I don't feel stifled during sweaty workouts. The fabric molds to your shape and the waistband isn't overly tight, so these are perfect for yoga, but probably less suited to high-impact activities like running. When it comes to opacity in the rear department, I will at least say that I've not had any underwear ""peek-through"" brought to my attention, the couple of times I've worn them; if they are at all sheer, it's well-disguised.",5
530576,"Damn... that's all I have to say. What also makes them so good is the red bottom, for this price this is a steal. It delivered so quickly I was so shocked when I saw how early it came. I ordered about half a size large because that was all that was left but I'm not gonna lie it was awesome.",5
294638,"I actually bought this for my mother, she is suffering from arthritis in her hands, and shoulders. I asked if the bracelets worked. She responded with a big smile and said that since she started wearing them, she has not had any problems any more. I don't know if it is a placebo effect, but it doesn't matter! She is happy then I am happy. Thanks a billion!",5
450434,"This made my 10 year old very happy.  It is nice and sparkly.  The chain will probably need to be replaced at some point, but for the price I can't complain.  It was the perfect length for her neck.  I assume for an adult a longer chain would be needed.",5
178121,"VERY tiny.  I love mine and wear it all the time.  BUT.  I am 5""4, 118 pounds, and I bought the large.  The waist was still too small and I had to make a small incision on the inside of the waistband and remove the elastic.  Now it's perfect.  It's quite soft.  Has survived a couple of washes so far.",4
790819,"Super soft and comfy. It's a bit long though, more tunic length than it appears in the picture. I'm 5'7"" so the length would definitely cause problems for someone any shorter if they weren't expecting it. Very loose fitting so you could order a size down and still be ok if you're worried about the length.",4
799092,"HATED THIS! This was made by a rusty robot child. The sew lines are all over the place. There are threads sticking out, like they didn't know how to use scissors. The material is thin and the size OF COURSE is way too small, like 3 sizes smaller than your actual American size. Unless you are anorexic and don't care the world can see your body through your dress, than don't bother purchasing. The picture looks like you could work with it, but you're going to hate it.",1
448602,"I was skeptical about this suit but relied on the reviews.  Order a size up.  I'm 5'2 -1/2"" and 120 lbs. and I ordered a medium-8; it fits great.  I could have a larger bust and booty and it would still fit well.  Also, the suit is lined.  Don't hesitate - the price cannot be beat.",5
420059,"This pendant is better looking in person than what you see. I decided that each of my closest friends will all get a butterfly pendant as a token of our friendship to tell them that where ever they may be, they are never alone. This one looks so elegant and I'm hoping that she'll like it!",5
447935,"Ordered size 6 (my closed shoe size is 5.5), left room for slightly thick socks. I've had it for more than a year, with moderate use and some days use on snow covered ground. This is what t looks like (see pic). No special care/spray on it. Kept me warm in the fall and very light. Use it for walking in NYC for around 8 miles-comfortable. I'm 5'4"" and goes a little over my knee when folded (2"" cuff). easy to put on.",4
232344,"I don't give glowing reviews easy, and no I didn't get anything in return for this review. This is an excellent quality item for the price. Great finish, wording g is clearly readable. Unbelievably fast turn around and shipping time for a custom piece of jewelry. Bought two items - 1 for my wife, 1 for my daughter - and will definitely buy from this seller again!",5
633243,Item was very poorly made.  Cheap material.  Size was supposed to be S-XS.  In reality it was at least a L-XL. When the foam padding is taken out the material is totally see through.  Very inadequate item eventhough it was inexpensive.  I tried to return but the seller wanted me to put it on and take a picture of myself and send it to him... That didn't happen!,1
41032,I ordered this item based on the picture. To my surprise the socks are white with black stripes. I was not pleased and this is not at all what I wanted or expected. I hope that I can return the item and get the ones that are advertised in the photo.,1
314666,"The thumb hole seems little tight, I think it is because the switching around the holes don't have much give, so today I didn't use the thumb holes - and they worked fine.  These are working great for me at work, helps keep my hands warm while typing.  They are well made and very good price.  I would buy them again.  I would have given them 5 stars but not much ""give"" around the thumb holes.",4

201919,The augmentation in this picture makes this piece look much chunkier than it really is. The earrings are chintzy  looking so I gave them to a child ho can play grown up with them. I still do not know if I'll wear the necklace. All in all a waste of money,1
343204,"I bought these to use for an upcoming surgery where I would have to remove my nose ring. It worked out great. I was concerned with it falling out sometime during the procedure, but it stayed secure through everything. I even slept in it the night after the surgery and the following morning it was still in place. Its lightweight, was easy to insert and remove and laid perfectly flat on my nose. Im pleased with my purchase.",5
420077,I thought it was going to be nicer and shiny unfortunately it looks likes a piece of cheap stamped metal with a bunch of lines through the design. The shape and size were good but the metal was cheap and it wasn't taken care of when made unfortunately. But you get what you pay for. If it is cheap price wise it is cheaply made.,2
63501,"I really love this product. The material is nicer than expected and is nice quality. I ordered it for my Relay for Life team's Ms. Relay contestant. I read the reviews and saw that the product runs big so I ordered a size smaller than normal and it fit perfectly. The cape is a bit small around the neck and the boot covers are actually a soft material, not the vinyl looking material of the picture, but overall the outfit  is great.",5
456907,"The necklace has always been something I wanted for a long time. I own it now and it is one of my favorite pieces of jewelry I own.

It may not be real silver, but that doesn't bother me when I feel like Arwen wearing this necklace.

Great price as well as great quality, only thing about it is that the chain was too short, either way I loved it.",5
143864,"Outstanding! Reduced my bulky bi-fold wallet to a simple,  very functional, lightweight wallet. Great quality throughout. I have no complaints. That being said...you will need to change the way you use your wallet. Buddy of mine said it just wasn't for him. If you.like carrying receipts, photos, key or business cards, this may not be for you. On the other hand if you want to slimline that bulky side of calf, this is the most stylish way to do it!",5
283437,The bathing suit would have fit perfectly IF it fit to size. I am a size medium in all of my clothing and the bottoms of this bathing suit could not pass my thighs... I am 130lbs and 5'3. Not sure what happened there! If you want to get this bathing suit make sure to get one size up.,2
129973,The fabric for the jacket was fine I even used the chart and measured myself and still got a size to small some of the buttons on the jacket were broken when I got it not to mention the main 8 buttons on the front look extremely poor quality would not recommend.,2
483084,"Love, love, love this top.
I actually just ordered a couple more. It is comfy and cute and flattering. I ordered it bc I'm 6 weeks postpartum and nothing fits and have been very pleased with it. Easy to throw on with leggings or jeans and a cardigan and not look like the tired mommy in sweats that I feel like. Highly recommend!",5
675046,"I was between sizes so following the other reviews, I ordered up. This dress fits great! The fabric is nice, heavier than I expected. It does need the petticoat under it though or it hangs sort of strangely. I will be ordering that as well but I wanted to make sure the dress fit first.",5
590623,They are a great fit. I'm a 14/16 and the L/XL was perfect fit. They aren't see through which made me so happy. My only complaint is that as soon as I put them on my wedding ring snagged on it good. I mean they snag VERY easily and it's a permanent thread sticking out now. I am not happy about that.,4
76233,"I cannot even imagine my pregnancy without this little guy. I have not had to purchase maternity clothing at all ( I am currently 9 months along ) and it's all because of this band. The size is perfect ( My pre-pregnancy size was a 2-4 or a 27 in jeans ), and then size 1 still fits perfectly now being 39 weeks along.

I love this product!",5
488886,"While I am sure of my correct size, I am not sure of the sizing of this company, I ordered a size larger than I normally where because I wanted to be on the safe side. This product was still too small for me. I would make a suggestion that this company rethink it's size chart. I will keep it as I am trying to loose weight and hoping to fit into it very soon. I did not like the size chart as it is not accurate.",3

It is much smaller than we had anticipated, but it is really cute so we will make it work by showing it with the glass open.  Do check out the size before buying.  The big surprise is it actually works, and there is a spare battery!",4

I asked to return the item, then the Seller started draggig their feet on refund, first they asked for item picture, I took one and emailed the seller, the seller then offers to refund 40% because ""they are in china"" i asked for full refund because item is useless to me, then they ask me for more pictures... I don't have time for this!!!!

Long story short, don't waste your time or money on this",1
474608,"This was a gift for my daughter. She picked it out, and neither of us read the description well. We both thought it was all silver, but the ctr band is silver, and the rings are white. It's very different than most other ctr rings. Even though we got something other than what we pictured in our heads, we were pleasantly surprised. She loves it! The fit was spot on, it came when scheduled, everything was great.",5
795707,"The BEST workout shirts I've owned.  Snug fit, not tight, so you can lift etc. with great freedom of movement - AND look great in gym.  Fabric is the softest wicking material I've used.  Took a 7 mile winter mountain hike two weeks ago - 32 degrees Cool T as base, plus long sleeve 32 Degree Heat, Wool sweater, down vest.  Air temp 25-30, perfectly warm & cool.  Sweat wicked through three layers out to inside of down vest, my skin was totally dry.  Can we get a few more colors?",5

Roughly 5'3, 250lbs and DD's......I ordered an extra large and while it doesn't hang droopy on my shoulders like the photo, it fits perfect and I've gotten tons of compliments! I ordered two more shirts from this company!",4

I got the double XL bc they were even longer, although they look bigger than normal, the length matters more and there's nothing wrong with big, comfy, pajama pants :) PLUS came with a free t-shirt as a gift from the company for being in business 10 years. Bonus!",5
581390,"I normally wear a 29x35L the length was great but the waist feels 2 sizes too big, even after washing them in hot water. They have a spandex stretch to them, which not sure I remember reading in the product description. The material too is good. Just order at least 1 to 2 sizes smaller than normal.",2
634330,"I am 5'7"" and wear a size 4 and thus dress didn't go over my butt, and the arms were not long enough :( so sad. Back to square one looking for a wedding dress! I expected it to not be amazing quality because of the price, but the edges were not finished on half the dress which is odd to me. Definitely a good fair quality dress if you're not looking for a wedding dress, but order a size or 2 up :)",2
839081,"I got a L/US-M according to the size charts :(  So sad, I was looking soooooo forward to wearing this dress. I am hoping that I can exchange the dress for a bigger size. I'm 5ft 150lb 36D, I buy online a lot and have had few problems. Other then that, you'll need to wear a slip the white parts are sheer.",3
553693,"Cute belt, but it smells so bad! The smell is completely overwhelming. I would describe it as somewhere between the smell of a chain-smoker's attic and a dirty litter box I hung it up in my bathroom to air out, but it just ended up making my bathroom smell equally as terrible. I can even smell it from my bedroom. Like I said, very cute in appearance, but I doubt I'll ever be able to wear it because after hanging up for 3 days it has only managed to make everything around it small equally as bad. Very disappointed.",1
72674,"This is super cute and super soft.  My autistic toddler will not tolerate most costumes, so I got her this and she loves it.  She wanted to wear it the whole month of November after Halloween.  It's good quality too.  I'm impressed and very happy with it.",5
600616,"This is just perfect for my grown son who lives in the DC area, and who shares the Pi day with his own birthday! So he was delighted and loves the shirt. It fits great, launders well, and has become his favorite.  It was easy to order online from my Florida home, but have it delivered straight to him at another address. Fast, Easy and Perfect Product as Described. I will use this site again! :D",5
855971,"The concept is nice, it looks good on, but i did not realize the scarf was a thin, printed, polyester.  For some reason i thought the scarf would have been knitted or weaved.  I am sure i missed the details in my reading.  Still i stick by the first sentence.",3
668923,"This dress looked very cheap, which I already expected since it wasn't very expensive; however, I immediately returned the dress upon trying it on because the neckline was extremely uneven. From the picture, you would expect this to be a ""sweetheart"" neckline (under the lace overlay). It was hideously uneven and unflattering... looked like someone just quickly sewed in a scrap piece of material underneath the lace. DO NOT waste your time and money on this sorry excuse for a dress.",1
88585,"I purchased these for myself for everyday earrings...and they are almost too dressy for every day & could easily be worn evenings to a semi-formal or formal event...they are simply the perfect date night earrings!!
I was so surprised how much I REALLY liked these earrings...they are BEAUTIFUL..and sterling on top of that!!
They sparkle like crazy & are very comfortable. They come in a gorgeous box that would be perfect for gift giving...definitely looks WAY more expensive than what I paid...I am very pleased with this purchase and would highly recommend.",5
592816,"Very, very disappointed. The straps are cheap and broke within 5 minutes of having this bikini. I am a 32DD and have a big butt and wideish hips, and this fits horribly. I ordered a small and even if I had ordered a medium it wouldn't have fit. The top does not stay up and the bottoms are super tight.",1
32845,"Really love this brand. I received my first pair as a gift and it lasted three (3) years of daily wear, it was used as a house slipper and the occasional run to do quick errands. Bought my 2nd pair and again 2 months short of three years. Now on my third and loving it although this pair one of the sandals is higher than the other.",5
255723,"This bracelet is adorable. It can be worn with casual or dress apparel. It's unique and very feminine. I didn't expect it to fit my larger wrist, but it does, albeit a little snugly. I must mention, though,  that it feels very fragile, so I'd recommend being careful with it. At this price, it's not a huge deal, but it's pretty enough that if it broke, I'd be sad. In all, I'd say it's worth getting if you have a small wrist. It's very pretty in person.",4
315098,"I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical about trying these as they look an awful lot like another brand of long-pouch boxer briefs I've tried.  Those had a much larger penis pouch, but absolutely NO room for his two best friends (the nuts).  These are a little smallish in diameter, but they have a nice pouch that is perfect for nuts.  Not to mention, the material is SUPER soft and comfortable.  I absolutely LOVED them from the first time I put them on!",5
771832,"I bought this product a few weeks ago to wear on vacation .  Its very cute and looks nice on but I began noticing that it has started to discolor.  I don't know if it is because I wore it in the ocean but I know I habe worm other belly rings and this has not occurred so it was disappointing.  I recommend wearing it for the occasion and then remove,  rinse, drying and put it away in order to preserve color. Wish I could continue wearing it.",3
21260,Really cute and just what we were looking for. Very lightweight and the neck flap does a great job protecting our grandson's very fair skin. Very easy to adjust the fit with the little tab on the back.  Dries quickly and the wicking material under the top of the hat keeps his head cool. We're happy.,5
607996,"Good quality shirt nice and thick. Did not notice shrinkage when washed. My husband loves it, he tells his hunting buddies where I got it. Bought another, in a different size and color, once I saw it and felt the quality. It came in the mail as expected, good packaging. Will come back to this company again.",5
96673,"Love these shoes, I have worn them all day and found them really comfortable with no aching feet at the end of the day. Fantastic colour and true to size. I also bought  Nike Women's Flex Supreme Tr 3 Pnk Pw/Mtllc Slvr/Cl Gry/White Training Shoe and these shoes are slightly more comfortable than those even though they look very similar.",5
341287,"These are stretching thinner leggings I got to wear under dresses in the winter instead of tights. They are a bit long for my 5'5"" frame but they are tight enough that the extra fabric isn't really a big deal. They are exactly what I wanted, less structure than leggings that you might wear under a tunic or something, but perfect for a dress (so you don't look like you're wearing pants under a skirt).",4
73793,I had to order 2 pair which I am sorry about because they are too big and fall off if I change my head positions.  They also do not block the sun very well.  I guess I would say they are not dark enough in the eyeglass part.,3
308015,"I ordered this for my little girl as other site were selling it dirt cheap and wanted extra money for shipping I find that wrong, but Amazon offers the two day shipping and I trust Amazon. It's soft and she loves the pattern. so if she's happy Mommy is happy too.",4
53914,Wanted something with a tie to keep my 2 year old from tearing this off her head like her other two hats (one with hook and loop). She got to pick the color - yellow- and she loves it. I don't even have to use the tie. The big brim is so cute on her too. Nice and light weight. I am impressed with the quality and look of all the iplay items I have bought.,5
420309,"These things are HUGE.  They almost hit my shoulders.  When I first got them I thought I probably would not wear them often since they are so dramatic and not really suitable for work.  However, I have found that I do like to wear them when I wear my hair up in a pony tail since the long earrings make the look seem more dressy.  The pearl is really nice.  The ""gold"" portion is really thin and light weight.  I would recommend the earrings if you are looking for a longer/bigger earring.",3
807865,"These are actually quite large, but not in a bad way.  It looks as if you're getting far more for your money then you'd believe.  However, the downside is that the backing for these is totally inadequate for the size of the pendant.  You'd be well advised to buy heavier duty backings.

The earring deserves 5*, but the seriousness of the totally unproportionally sized safety feature requires the deduction of a full star rating.  Perhaps the manufacturers will see in the future the errors of their ways and fix this problem.",4
159366,"As a male who bought this, I was actually pleasantly surprised by how well it fit me. Its a little small, but I expected that and I like my clothes to fit a bit slimmer. I am about 5'11 and super skinny so I usually have to buy womens clothing to find something that fits. The design on the shirt was very high quality and colorful. Shipping was much faster than estimated which was awesome too. All in all, extremely high quality, but I wish it was just a little bit longer and more roomy.",4
335137,This is my favorite swimsuit. The fit is flattering over my curves and it's very comfortable. There are boy-shorts attached underneath for modesty. The straps are wide and supportive and the built-in bra cups are flattering and comfortable. We have a pool and swim almost every day. This suit gets a lot of use and both the color and the fit have held up,5
311570,"My girls really like the shoes but it seems that the size was little smaller than what we expected. So i am in the process of returning back the shoes.
Amazon should allow replacing the shoes if the size is not correct. When i called the customer support, i was told that i have to return these shoes and then create a new order with the bigger size.",4
697827,These pants are so comfortable with a perfect fit for me. They don't show the unattractive parts of my legs and the design is cool. I will use primarily for yoga but they would be good for any sport. I would buy another pair. I just wish they made a yoga tank top with a racer back and shelf bra in that same material.,5
201267,Had a few rough spots on the edges that I had to sand down with a metal file hence the 3 stars.  But I like the bracelet.  Also like that it is flexible enough for me to squeeze it tight on my arm then open it back up to take it off.,3
164428,I love these leggings and have them in many colors but unfortunately the Mango Flame is a bit see through. I only wear them with a longer shirt at the gym. The color is really pretty though. Like a bright coral. I will still continue to buy these as I usually have good luck. The sage color was fine but these no.,4
87690,I love this dress. It fits perfectly and looks so cute anywhere you go. Every time I go out I always get a lot of compliments about the dress. I am a little afraid the bow might come off after a few washes but it's nothing some needle and thread can't handle!,5
187116,"I love ""retro"" and ""vintage"" swimsuits, so this was a must have. It arrived on time and I immediately tried it on-- perfect fit on the bottom, but the top was a little big. (Ordered an XXL, too big for my D cup bust.)
Super cute, super comfortable, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to hide a little midsection pudge... Or just to feel like a goddess!",5
49845,"Beautiful cover-up, can't believe I could buy it for such price!! Looks beautiful with black one-piece swimming suit. Very happy I purchased it , thank everybody who posted their reviews , it helped a lot , so I bought with confidence. If you looking for cover-up( to hide your big tights ) this is a beautiful piece!! I am  14 ( XL) fits very well , you can tie it as a single , or fold it twice and then tie , so you will get short skirt( to swim comfortable )
Hope it will help you with your decision!",5
29605,"Yup, it was definitely pretty good.  It is uncomfortable to wear but not too bad.  It looks pretty good.  The zipper in front is a bit visible but I'm not griping too hard.  I liked it.  We had a contest at work for the 4 best consumes and I was first to receive a prize.",4
298319,"The shirt itself is a lovely cut and the size was true and it looked to be well made but it is completely see through. Like, I can read a book clear as day through it kind of see through which was much more than I expected. If you don't mind the serious sheer then you will likely love the shirt especially if you are curvey or large busted as the cut is very flattering but for me I requested a refund. Its just too sheer to wear to work which is what I bought it for.",3
328307,"All the measurements would fit me perfectly. Except there was one fatal flaw. The neck area was sewn to a diameter of a toddler football, and it was stiff and not stretchy at all. Because of this, I couldn't even get the shirt on, let alone over my head. Too bad- it was very cute.",1
239634,"Fits perfect! I wanted a very thin, durable band to wear every day. My engagement ring and wedding bands are all soldered together so I love that I can keep this band on all the time and slide my larger diamond bands on with it when I want to. I work in healthcare and am constantly putting lotion on my hands. I like that I can keep this band on and it doesn't trap lotion underneath.",5
141511,I've had this purse for 6 months now. The shoulder strap came unstitched but does that affect appearance or durability. SO MUCH ROOM. This purse is huge. I can fit everything I need in here plus some if I don't want to take a separate bag. It still looks great. Dull of course but as an everyday purse I'm amazed at how great it still looks!,5
732448,"Way too small, and cheap, and the opening for the neck doesn't look good when you are wearing it, and bunches up in all the wrong places. This is also much shorter than it looks, - in the picture, because of where they've draped the shoulders, it looks like the neck opening is large, btu it's not, it's actually almost snug. It's also much thinner than I thought it'd be. I really regret this purchase.",1
564927,"Zipper is broken and detached,  may be it has been used and returned.  I bought a smaller size last year and it was perfect.

I think the Royal Wedding in 2011 really sparked her love for it, or maybe she just decided, ""Screw it, 86 years old is old enough to not care about wearing a giant bling ring."" Either way, this may be a shiny hunk of cheap material but the pure joy on her face when she opened it was worth it. It's a pretty decent piece and she still wears it to this day.",4
479303,"absolutely LOVE this sweater but usually when i buy i buy 1 size larger to make sure the fit is good but this is the first time it was to big....wish i would have purchased the exact size that's the only reason for the missing star...otherwise it it well made nice and thick material, wonderful design and good deep color!",4

It's too tight for me. i usually order a large in hats, but this one was offered in one size only. My hats are generally just above medium-sized (I buy adjustable baseball caps, for example, but only have to let them out a notch or two from the middle.)

Dress is quite pretty, but fabric not quite suitable for a larger person such as myself - a little too clingy. The color is beautiful - a rich teal.
Size is a little bigger than expected - will have to make some adjustments in the under-arm area. But that could be my body shape rather than the dress.

577381,I love this wallet. It is cute and stylish. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because it has a weird quote on the flap and the quote makes absolutely no sense.. I didn't buy the wallet for the quote. The only other complaint that I have is that the pocket where my drivers license goes broke on the back side. The pocket is still functional and its not a big deal to me because the wallet is still very functional.,4

177831,"I asked for large but it was like a baby large ! Not a teen large u should mention that the sizes for 12 years and smaller  any way it was just the same photo it was great
 but i was just disappointed by the size but every thing else os good goodluck",3
821740,"FIrst, understand that the rating really has nothing to do with the product itself...like so many shoe manufacturers, these do not come in widths (at least not on Amazon). Medium width just won't get it for me. Some suggested that it would stretch, but I seriously doubted they would have stretched enough for me.",1
167627,"Loved these so much, that I bought my daughter a pair also! Comfy, cute and I love the functionality of these capris, Aside from the easy to use pocket in the waist, I also love the way they make my butt look! I was sent this product at a discounted price for my review.",5
123928,"I like the dress. It fits nicely and looks good, but it's not really as fluffy as it looks in the picture. It looks more like a cotton material in person. Other than that it's a very nice dress. I also think that I got a size larger than I normally wear so it's a little more baggy.",4
357127,It fit perfectly on her and the quality of the lab coat is excellent.  The design and pocket placement is perfect for little ones.  The lab coat does not feel like the material used in costumes.  This lab coat is thick and durable.  Well made.  I am glad I made this purchase.,5
765262,"This is not worth the money at all! Besides the dress showing up with a button dangling, The material is really thin, the size is way off and the sleeves are gigantic. When I emailed the seller he told me he'd give me 6 dollars instead of refunding me. Don't waste your money or support this business!",1
653099,"Love love love this dress , i was expecting it in September but it came in August!!! Fits truly and feels like a night gown so very comfy. It's a little this, like you can see neon or any color underwear but that can be fixed with some black underwear or some dark colored shorts underneath. Great dress, will buy again ",5
260338,"It's cute. Fades quick, but I wear it all the time. Also rusting by the clasps onto the rope part. Again, I wear it all the time including in the water. It also rotates on my wrist and the clasp ends up being the part that shows even on the tightest ring. No fault of the manufacturer I guess.",4
669775,Got it January 9 2016 today is April 25 2016. It is literally falling apart.  Strap and zippers broke and it's coming un-stitched. It looked amazing when I got it but it's poorly made. Sad thing about it..it was part of my Christmas and I'm stuck with it. Very disappointed.,2
228520,just got this today look nice and all but look too big on my wrist if i have it in the front of my wrist if i push it back it won't be hanging as much look better that way but overall it's just an ok bracelet i will not be getting another one,3
569821,This scarf just arrived and it's super nice!  It's very lightweight and it's soooo pretty.  I can use it as a shawl around my shoulders for colder days here at the office when the air conditioning is too cold and makes a lovely scarf to wear with my winter jacket as well.,5
621796,I'm 23 weeks pregnant 140 pounds and the dress fits nice. The pans for the breast are in a weird place. I'm 5'3 and it goes past my knees like the picture they use. It has a good stretch but I don't think it would fit someone like the picture that's maybe 120 pounds or less.,4
147775,"I have only had it a week, but it looks great at this point.  Banged it up s little and still no scratched.  Sizes accurately, arrived in perfect condition.

Very happy with it, particularly for the price.  Really didn't want to spend $300 or more to replace a lost ring.

Someone who knows what they are doing can probably tell it from white gold, but my wife and I cant.

Update:  A month later it still looks as good as new.

Cant beat it for $18.",5
759667,"Nice looking shirt, but a bit on the snug side. I normally take an XL and they are usually a good fit or perhaps just a bit loose. This one is definitely a tighter fit. It'll be okay as long I wash it in cold water and put in nowhere near my dryer. Note: washing instructions say to hand wash.",4
859271,"These are very comfy and slimming. I've lost some weight recently and still fit into them, which is nice that they covered a range of sizes for me. They aren't the most breathable so I wouldn't wear them around for too long after exercising in them, but for the price they can't be beat!",4
333578,It was exactly what I was looking for. The metal was a perfect balance of strong but not heavy. The rubber inside the clips protects the fabric and stays attached to clothing without sliding. I only used it on dresses and light weight tops. I don't know how or if it would work on jackets or anything heavy.,5
783465,"Really liked this checkbook cover, good quality nice leather, until I tried putting my checks and register in. The length was only 6 1\4 inch, not the 6 1\2 inch it says in the description and needs to be so the checks will fit. Wish the description had been accurate so I would have known it was to small and wouldnt have ordered and now have to go thru the hassle of returning it.",2
769770,"These are adorable! Much higher quality than expected. I was afraid they were going to get instantly ruined because they're so light. Lo and behold, the first time wearing them the little spilled a strawberry soda on them. I figured they were play clothes now. It washed out after sitting in the hamper for two days! I didn't even use bleach. This fabric is practically stain resistant! Size is accurate. So many compliments. Adorable!",5
45065,"Exactly what I was looking for. It is a very sturdy belt which causes it to stay in place when worn. I have used it once so far and it was pretty comfortable and did not lose its shape in any way. Furthermore, it is true to size. I intend to buy more in different colors.",5
687078,Nice shirt but sizes are totally off base --- I even ordered a Large per Seller's suggestion when I take a Medium and the shirt was still way too small to the point I could hardly move my arms.  I'm not sure how someone could order any shirt from this seller and count on getting a size that fits.,1
333336,These are great toddler training underwear. Fits pretty well on my son... he is about on the smaller size but I ordered according to his age. My son is excited to wear them because of the Mickey Mouse print. Pee will soak through so don't expect it to act like a diaper.,5
45664,"I reallllllly love this skeleton catsuit. Very flattering for, I would imagine, most body types? It has a good thickness to it, so it's not paper thin and it's not SUPER thick, but I was comfortable wearing leggings beneath it and a coat over in 37 degree trick or treating. I'm 190 lbs, 5'7"" and I ordered a large. Perfect fit!!",5
22736,"Received stretcher on time. Immediately installed and stretched one boot, the next morning removed from first boot and attempted to stretch second boot but stretcher stopped working. If out of boot will expand, but if any pressure is exerted on form, it collapses to closed position. Not worth the money.",1
241683,Arrived promply. Just as expected. I had gotten myself a 3mm one as my wedding band and just got this 6mm for my husband. I love them cause they're so shiny and will never fade or scratch so no worries at work. They also have nice weight to them. Love it. Would buy again.,5
829163,I'm 5'7 165lb and 38D cup I got an XL it makes my chest look awesome and isn't as short as I thought it would be. I felt like I was taking a risk buying this but I'm so happy with. It got here so quickly too. Said it would get here between Aug 22 - September 8 but I got it Aug 5th,5
245175,Very cheap looking Minnie ears. I bought these in advance for a trip I was taking with my daughter to Disney World. When I got them they looked so cheap I was too embarrassed to wear them at the park. Also some of the threading had already started to come undone. I guess they would work fine just for a costume or to play with.,3
705286,"I bought this bag to consolidate all the ""stuff"" I take on trips. Now I have all of my toiletries in one bag. The bag has plenty of room for shampoo, razers, soaps, etc. The different sections makes it easy to organize.  I love carrying just one bag into the bathroom when I need my toiletries.",5
85347,"I am not a fan of ""fake"" buttons, so I was disappointed to find out this doesn't unbutton. It really is just a seam sewn on the front of the sweater with buttons on it. As others said, it's thin material and the sleeves are shorter than they appear in the pic. Still, I'll give it an ""OK"" rating. Not bad overall. Just not wonderful.",3
49492,"I measured myself before looking at their sizing chart. For 37"" inch waist they recommend a size small so thats what I ordered.
After three days it was already too large to have lasting effects. The band definitely works and I started using after two weeks of delivery.

I like to exchange for an extra small as I love the product and sent seller an email to see if I can exchange for an extra small and waiting on their reply. Will update you once I hear from them.

Due to material band will crinkle. But doesnt affect results.",4

441829,"I have been looking for a black hand muff forever.  I could only find white/ivory bridal ones.  I purchased for a sleigh ride in the mountains of Colorado and I wanted to make sure my hands would be warm (and look good too).  Very pleased with this purchase. I always get compliments when I wear it - not many people wear hand muffs anymore. As silly as it sounds, I feel like a princess when I wear it.",5
95362,i did want this to be a lil oversized so I went bigger but it fits just right so in sayimh that I was a lil dissapointed If you want this I would jus say go up 1 size from what you tjink you are unless you want it snug,2
120993,"cute hat! My 15 month old daughter has a smaller head size, but the 9-18 month one fits pretty well and she has room to grow into it. The tie on this is essential in my opinion so it stays on her head and she can't pull it off. It is floppy but stays out of her eyes so she can still see. The print is very cute and it functions well!",5
138657,"These capris are great quality and provide great support.  I'm 6 mos pregnant and wanted something for walking and yoga.  The fabric is thick, not sheer at all, and very supportive all the way up.  I thought the criss-cross back would be weird but it's not at all.

I previously purchased Beyond Yoga maternity pants and was so disappointed with the quality and support (they wouldn't stay up, kept falling down by butt - wish I was kidding), so I was eager to find yoga pants I can wear throughout my pregnancy.",5
706165,"Dress as advertised, pictured.  Super comfortable, slightly stretchy material as well.  Flares out and looks lovely.  The bust line is very high for the sweetheart style neckline, fyi.  So that part is a bit different.  As in, pretty much at the collarbone.  I normally wear a 34C, size 4, 5'7"" and this size fit great.  Fun dress, and I would love to order more with a slightly more flattering neckline!",4
490275,"Great shirt. I had tried it on in a smaller size in the store that didn't have my size. This one is perfect. I usually wear a 10 and the small was tight. The medium is right. Good material, nice fitting cut, much better for women than the usual man style fishing shirt.",5
517096,"Worst product ever. It arrived on time but stitching was missing on two sides on the front and two sides on the back. Overprices, unable to wear ever again because where there wasn't stitching it just continued to separate. Description did not describe this and unable to send back since I wore it. I appeared to be made this way but the quality sucked. DO NOT BUY!!!",1
134611,"They fit well and are very attractive. The problem is that the mostly cotton description is misleading, since the cotton is on the outside and the entire inside of the sock is poly/nylon/artificial fiber. Since I buy cotton or mostly cotton for comfort and hypo-allergenic reasons, that was a disappointment.",3
119822,These are great! Waaaaay better than the disposable swim diapers. I have 1 1/2 yr old twins and a swimming pool and using the disposable diapers everyday was just gross and expensive. These actually hold a LITTLE pee (unlike disposables) so I'm not getting peed on constantly and they're easy to rinse out at the end of the day (or after a poop).The babies seem pretty comfortable in them too. They haven't complained once.,5
512841,I bought a size 8 it was too big. I requested a return and another dress size 6 this time. The people handled my request very fast and I received the second dress in a week. The dress is gorgeous and it was a perfect  fit! Thank you Crystal Dresses.,5
272400,"The quality is decent. Looks like the photo. But....
I now understand why they have a big girl as the hand model. These rings won't fit unless you are 250 pounds and/or have sausage fingers. The price is cheap but I'm really disappointed. I can't even give it away as a gift. Looks like I'll have to leave them at a local mcdonalds. See if anyone wants them.",2
399917,"The best I can say about this piece is that it's exactly as seen in the picture. What you see is what you get. The fabric is velvet, but it's not very thick, so it will stretch a little bit.

On a personal note, I find the jacket affordable and versatile (good with a Goth or Victorian ensemble, a normal-designed skirt or even a pair of jeans).

Absolutely recommended.",5
26174,"This is a wonderful product!  Even though it was a little large for my shoes, I was able to cut the orthotics to size.  They give me a fair amount of relief from my Plantar Fasciitis.  They were recommended by my Podiatrist, so I'm glad I got busy and ordered these Powerstep Pinnacle Orthotics.",5
15596,"Beautifully made, perfect fit (16 32/33) with adjustable length cuff that I did not have to adjust.

Packaged like a $ 100 shirt.

Removing the hidden buttons will only take a minute if you do want to use the studs already present in the button holes or hopefully your own since the free ones are made of plastic.  Just be a little careful in cutting the threads off the existing buttons.  Not a big deal.",5
2352,I love the way these look... but my baby wore them two times and the string broke on both shoes.  My husband did it on the first one and I yelled at him saying he pulled too hard and I went to tie the second shoe and the lace completely ripped off.  What a waste of money!!!  I do not even know who to contact on here to discuss a replacement or return.,1
309997,"I can't tell you how many times I've passed up a pair of earrings because of the weight and because one of my lobes has been stretched. (My daughter, as an infant, pulled my earring.  My lobe was not split, but close!)..The Ear Lobe Expert is the perfect inexpensive solution.",5
76036,"It functions for its stated purpose; it hides the fact that my pants are unbuttoned (but are held together by a rubber band). That said, I am disappointed. The band constantly rolls down, and requires adjusting. If you don't fold it over so as to avoid the rolling down problem, the band isn't tight enough to conceal unbuttoned pants.",2
827552,My son loves this shirt his older brother has tons of dinosaur shirt and we couldn't find one that fit well for my baby. He was so happy and couldn't stop looking at his Dino shirt. My older son wants one as well because he says it's awesome that the dinosaur has a long neck. The long sleeves is great for the cool weather days where he needs to be warmer. I love it and it's so soft. I received this product for my honest review.,5
602256,"This is definitely costumey...but if what you are looking for is a costume only, then this works.  The skirt is a bit flimsy though; for mine, the edge where they hemmed was a bit sloppy.  The bustier is good.  :)  Overall, I like it for the price.",4
107575,"If you are looking for a turquoise ring DO NOT GET THIS! This ring is more a mint green color - not like pictured on the photo. I still like it as it does still work for some of my other outfits. I would have given it at least 4 stars otherwise but, when I got it, the sides of the ring with the pattern were already missing some silver (copper color is underneath) and also on the first wear, it started turning my finger green.",3
448945,"This dress was very beautiful and arrived with minimal wrinkles and the flower was NOT squished, which I was happy about. I ended up giving this dress to a family member because the bust was too large for me so I never got to wear it. However, for the price this dress is worth it.",4
179071,"These sun glasses are great for fishing.  Easily fit over prescription glasses and are not excessively heavy.  I wore them a full day trout fishing without any difficulty.  I do, however, recommend a neck safety strap be used to prevent loss.
All in all......a good pair of polarized sun glasses.",5
625448,"Wonderful coverage for leather dye.  High quality, but the cordovan color is VERY dark and almost black.  My shoes were reddish maroon cordovan and the same color as off-the shelf wax cordovan polish. This dye was not what I expected.  The resolene product from Fiebing is excellent and expected this dye to be perfect. Box and bottle are printed ""Cordovan"".  Not quite.",3
503392,I'm extremely pleased with these and can't wait to get more.  They have nice color and fit well but the best part is that they are long.  No shortage of material here - makes me feel very comfortable and gives me peace of mind that I don't have to tug my shirt down constantly.,5
410324,"Beautiful baptism outfit for my son. The picture doesn't do it justice. I wanted a one piece outfit so I wouldn't have to worry about adjusting clothing. It is just perfect. Also, it is not girly, it has a bow tie on it! The hat also matches, I can't wait for my son's baptism now.",5
164626,"Great color.  Great fit, and I love the side pockets.  The one thing that is weird is, they have no ventilation so I would not wear them for real exercise - definitely not for running or serious hiking.  Because they are capri they are not quite right for winter, and because they are a rather thick material without mesh ventilation, they are not quite right for summer.  I wear them for kicking about and the grocery store, that's about it.",5
548005,"I am giving it more than one start because of the absolutely wonderful customer service.  But After only one hour of wearing it, the leatherette scraped off where the buckle was and I had to discard it at the wedding I was attending.  But it was really cute for that one hour!  I would definitely order from this company again, though.  But not this product.",2
67676,"I absolutely love this ring - it really sparkles and looks very fine and expensive, plus it's comfortable to wear.  I paid $25 for this ring, and it's an absolute steal for that price!!

Green amethyst is also known as prasiolite.  Some users have complained that the green stone on this particular ring is quite pale, but that color is typical for prasiolite.  The stone's name comes from Greek and means ""leek colored stone"".  If you want a bright lime green stone with a punch of color, I suggest peridot.  Or, for a deeper green, emerald.",5
26566,I am happy that another customer that was reviewing another product mentioned these. They were exactly what I was looking for. These insoles fit perfectly in my work shoes. They are great for my heals and have great arch support. I stand and walk a lot at my job. It's been a week and my feet love them!,5
288629,"Wish I had these in the Navy. They hold tight onto my shirts without tearing the fabric or causing too much a wrinkle. The bands feel very nice and well built. Doesn't feel cheap at all. I am beyond satisfied with my purchase.
I will update after I give them their first initial wash.",5
496170,love this suit.. sexy without being revealing.. good fit and the colors are lovely..

Also my larger breasts fit in the outfit without looking comical and I enjoyed a great party without embarrassment or being uncomfortable.",5
573473,"Nicely made, good quality, but I think these are a little pricey at $19.99.  They are a little bit bigger & bulkier than I expected & not something I'd ever personally wear, Ever.

94020,"These get the job done for the price, but the lenses are extremely prone to scratches. Yeah yeah, I know, I could just keep track of them better, but that's what cheap sunglasses are for!

If you dig the style then go for it, otherwise consider my review.",3
458081,"it is a pretty dress on the picture but in reality all the white accents are made with a cheap looking, thick, cotton trim and the dress itself is synthetic which gives it a very cheap and mismatched look.  I never sent it back but I also never wore it and probably never will.",2

435627,"I needed size 6 for my girlfriend, but the size information only gave international size # comparisons, not which shoe size corresponds with small, medium and large. As only ""womens"" medium and large were offered, I purchased the medium, which were too big. Amazon or the vendor needs to improve the info on the size guide. I've since found the same socks in small and my girlfriend loves them.",3

624175,"I love it thou. A little big unless I wear a bulky sweater under, then it's good. I love it so much I ordered another one a size smaller to wear with blouses.

92787,"The shirt design is stitched thread, kinda classy no? And the stitching has a proper backing for comfort. Just don't let her pull at it.  The pants design is done well as a printed, ink on fabric image, and the fabric is a proper purple, not Sprayed on purple you know.",5
737022,"Arrived in record time I do like the item but did not look like a turtleneck in the picture but it is, besides that it looks just like the picture.  No tags at all for washing instructions and is on the thin side so will have to be careful when washing.  Quality is ok but not  what I would call excellent for the price... Not even sure what the material is since there are no tags.",2

Our cat, who loves to play with shoes laces, is very unhappy.",5
567306,"We bought a small. The coat looks nice online but wheb it arrived, this hood is just weird and oversized when placed over the head.

I am sure it will be too difficult to return so we are stuck with it and the funny hoody.",2

They are only see thru in the light colors paired with loud underwear.  The jade color is actually closer to aqua and goes with any other aqua or turquoise outfits.",5
658716,These jeans were such poor quality from the material to the craftsmanship. It looked as if a 12 yr old put them together in 5 minutes. When I tried to send them back to the company it was going to cost more in shipping because the company is in China! All the company was willing to do is give me 30% off the jeans and let me keep them. I am so dissatisfied with these jeans. They are NOT the same jeans as in the picture either. What a scam!,1

The RFID portion works very well, protected on both sides although kind of annoying because I have to take my Bus card out to scan because the wallet blocks the chip. Does what it is intended to do 10/10.",5

Great shoes for a great price.  I definitely recommend these!,5

I am 6'5 with an athletic build albeit a little fat and need big and tall clothes, I often get 2x for shirts and dress shirts, but this shirt, although looks nice needs to be tucked in no matter what.

Not exact pattern as shown in description pix but still pretty. Very sheer, but meant to be worn over shorts & tank. Comfy piece on hot summer days.

Would not recommend!! Wish I could return it but not sure how that works with amazon!,1

I would venture to see what else this store has to offer but expect to purchase a size larger than you might usually wear.",2

The bottom was a little tighter that I would have preferred. The material is a bit thin and I'm not necessarily a huge fan of the grey part but it's a very comfy shirt for layering in general. I recommend sizing up if you want it to be a little less form fitting. I received this product at a discount for my honest, unbiased review.",4

The strap is adjustable so that is great for me, as I am a shorter person. It is very durable and has quality canvas. The price may be a little high, but overall I liked the bag.

I received this product at a reduced amount for my honest and unbiased opinion.",4

In fact, we loved it so much that I bought a second one for my Daughter!",5

They really are pretty and aren't huge and gawdy. They're very elegant and match any outfit.

Pros: Great gift idea!
Earrings are well made, posts sturdy
Shiny and stand out!

Cons: none

Overall: seriously beautiful, well made and great accent for a night out. Not too much for daily wear either. Great deal!

I did receive these in exchange for my unbiased review.",5
64271,"The designs are cute and my son liked them when he was in the Elmo-fascination phase. However, they were just way to tight and too small from the get-go. I still have about three unused pairs in the package because they got way too tight sooner than I thought. Granted that kids grow fast, but just keep in mind that maybe you should order one size up.",3

Happy to say, Instant ship with upgrade fee.
Thanks Bunches,  Cheers,  Zoe",5

511535,I really like the look.  It is very versatile but one of the pins fell out after 1.5 weeks and the bracelet broke.  I returned it but really want to order another one if things work out.  The magnet really helped the pain in my wrist which I believe is arthritis.,4
492559,I really liked the wine color to match other accessories but I found the RFID slots to be very stiff and too tight.  It was very difficult to get my Drivers license out at airport and for other purchases requiring it.  Did not care for the crinkling sound when using credit cards.,3
104510,"Pretty suit.  Basically fit well, except for the band under the bust...an elastic at the bottom of the bra lining.  VERY TIGHT...and that is not a weight issue area for me.

I would never wear these in public, so I had to return them. The back is just the right amount of cheeky, but they are by no means high cut. They fit just like a regular bikini across the hips. I suppose they might look the way as advertised if the person weighed less than 120 and was built differently.",2

I then cut the feet out thinking I might still be able to wear them with boots - but they were much too tight in the waist to wear comfortably or sit down. During my efforts to get them on they ran, and I threw them away.  Don't waste your money unless you're very petite!",1

507160,We purchased three pairs of these sunglasses and would NEVER do so again. They are shabbily made and each pair displayed the same 2 issues: (1) The side pieces fell out.

(2) The ear pieces keep peeling after the few times we wear them. The good qualities are of no matter to us. So the game is over.,1

My only complaint is that the inside of the jacket is a fuzzy material, like faux fur.

So if you like your skirts short this one will be fine. Too bad the size chart does not mention length. This skirt should have been listed as knee length for women under 5'.",2

Everything was fine until about 2 months ago when I noticed the moon phase indicator was ahead of the actual moon phase.  I contacted the company (in Germany) and received instructions on how to make changes to the watch.  I tried twice to make the changes but it did not work.  So I paid a lot of money for a poor product.  I do not recommend anyone purchase this watch.,2

I wore 1 and when I took it out I noticed the color of the metal had changed color. Not the best quality. I ended up ordering surgical steel ones from another maker also with smaller balls. I have a small nose so the fit was better.,1

My daughter often steals it from me and wears it around the house as a tutu over her clothes.  It's well made and has even held up well to her rough play.  This is so nice that I'd love to buy another one that is a little bit longer for my longer skirts.,5

The glow substance inside the locket it applyed a little messy. Its a really cute locket but you cant really put anything inside. Great necklace for the price!,5
512957,"I ordered the red one and color was nice. On the other hand the material was cheap, very thin. No padding at all in the bottoms. Therefore you can see allllll of your junk. Which was pretty awkward. Also, there wasn't padding in my top so you could see my nipples. I had to use padding from my other swimsuit. Over all other than that it still looked good on me, and that all that really matters.",3

It's definitely not your top of the line kind of quality but I didn't pay your top of the line kind of price. It's comfortable, fits well and is really cute. I'm a size 12 all day long, 5'7"" and very large chested. I got the 2x and it fits great. It's also really well made. I might just order another one for a back up.",4

This dress is not horrible, (if you know how to accessorize) but it's not great either..it's just ok. For the price we paid, I guess ok can do. Make sure you have the proper undergarments because the material is thin and also make sure you order two sizes above your regular dress size.",3

The straps are a bit shorter than I was expecting; it's definitely not something that works as a shoulder bag, which is what I am used to (hence 4 stars instead of 5, but that is just my personal preference).

Other than that, the fabric and flow and swirl of the skirt was really attractive,",3
62465,Poor poor poor quality. This hat was a big disappointment. I reviewed the comments on this product closely and decided there was enough positive comments to give it a try. Please reconsider. I got this for my friends birthday. The hat has no shape. There are vent holes at the top that is far too obvious that makes that look silly. The size is big for a one size fits all.,1

489717,The product is just fine. I bought this as a gift for a frequent traveller who could also stash away the passport. The space available to store currency notes is not as much as what an average wallet would be able to carry without making the wallet bulge out awkwardly.,4
55790,"I hoped to get a good field jacket and I would be willing to pay such a large amount of money. But fact is, the XS Navy jacket sucks ass. It was so stiff and very uncomfortable. I know Alpha got a good reputation for M65 but sorry this one is way worse than a 50 dollars mimic one from H&M",1
760902,"It's a very unique design and is like wearing art. My mom gets many compliments. It is more of a close fit, than one expects from a hoodie. It does not add a lot of bulk and fits her figure. Mom is 5' 8"" and wears size 8 or 10. She is busty but its fine. .She got the medium and It looks good on. I like my hoodies roomier and don't care if it adds bulk or makes me look a bit bigger, I probably would get the size up.",5
157156,"First of all- it takes a few weeks to get from the UK to USA but it did arrive a week earlier than the date i was expecting it.

it's soft and warm, yet very light. and it looks nicer than the picture shows- i'm very happy with it. I ordered a size up because i wanted it to be loose, and it's perfect. if you want it more fitted or are only wearing it over tight tees and tanks then just order your normal size.",5
715462,My son is so excited for Halloween he and his friends were doing suggestions and making videos and having fun taking pictures and we're still two months away from Halloween . It was beyond our expectation beyond our expectations. Definitely great quality would purchase from seller again. My older boys are even envious and even in my younger boys they all want to be Deadpool now.,5
289742,"Love these socks. Fun patterns and they launder well. I'm a woman, but with large feet - I wear a men's size 10 shoe. It's tough getting these socks around my heel. So even though they are men's socks, I think it would be pretty difficult for a man with larger feet to get them on.",5
314955,"I was afraid it don't fit me, so after read the comments I decided order a L size (I'm 1.70 m and 36 B chest), It fit me perfectly, is really cute and comfortable, fabric could be less thin but for that price, is good (At least you can't see through). The shipping was really fast (It arrived before estimated date), I would buy another dress, definitely. I recommend check the size in the last image, because maybe you need to buy one size more than usually.",5
873589,This is a really durable and comfortable little wallet.  Small enough to be worn under your coat but large enough to carry all of the essentials.  I used it all summer and it was great.  Durable strap is adjustable in length.  Strong velcro pockets keep everything safe.,5
827908,The only reason that I'm giving this 3 stars is because the fit was a little loose.  I'm 145 lbs with a large chest at 36DD and I was surprised that the small fit so loose.  I wish that they had and x-small because I love the colors and the cut.,3
210837,I love these but I took off the skull heads for awhile and the ball unscrewed on one side. I had no idea I had to actually keep the skulls on just to keep the ball in. They only snap on so I figured it was just a decoration. Other than that I like.,5
804589,"yellow color is light yellow,like mellow yellow not bright. It is comfortable true to size . No need to size up if you are wearing it as an abaya. If you want a flattering effect and not an abaya then might need to size down, Fabric is comfortable like a thicker t shirt",5
82813,"Fabric is amazing, and the construction is beautiful. Take the advice of ordering based on cup size, but also arms run relatively slim so if you are unsure about the size, go for the next size up. If you are on the fence about buying it, just do it because the piece is a great addition to a wardrobe.",5
100087,"I have nothing but praise for this case.  For anyone who has Sprint as your carrier and was able to pickup the Samsung Galaxy Tablet 3 for $49, will recognize this case as a good bargain as well.  Nothing but praise from me.  Fits like a glove and the only reason I did not give it five stars is because its not genuine leather.  But I am not complaining.",4
726990,I got one of these for myself but prefer slouchy caps. My boyfriend stole it and loves it. I have since purchased 2 more for him and 2 for another guy friend that also loves the style and fit. Cozy enough for winter but breathable enough for warmer weather too.,5
877244,"Exactly as pictured, warm, and looks to be good quality. Best for small adult or kid heads, but it's very stretchy so anyone could wear it, it just wouldn't be as comfortable. It's very soft, too, and arrived faster than I expected. I wouldn't drop everything to buy it but with winter coming, I like to have some warm hats on hand, and I like that this one is a neutral color (I got gray) but still has a little something to make it cute without being crazy.",4
365625,This was exactly what I needed for my Mardi Gras costume. Arrived in excellent condition. Used my fingers to separate the curls a little and clipped in so easy. I ordered the dark brown & you couldn't see the clip unless you were looking for it. I'll be using it again.,5
564950,"Really cute! The fabric is super soft and plush but not too heavy. I got the pink dinosaur, the tail is stuffed and fluffy but doesn't weigh you down. I got the XL, I am 5'8"" 160lbs., and the legs don't reach my ankles, but otherwise it fits well, roomy but comfortable. Overall it seems well made.",4
416471,My daughter was 12 lbs 10 oz at 4 mo when she wore this and the 3-6 fit with room. But she is very lean not chubby. I sent it back once because the embroidery wasnoticeably uneven and second one was just fine. I think it's just stunning. I liked that it wasn't poofy because she is petite so it wasn't overwhelming on her and it sparkled which I loved.,4
89024,"I've bought a lot of clothing from this seller and more often than not, I'm really pleased. However, I did not like this shirt AT ALL! Usually their shirts are made from a more cotton-like material. I have no idea what this was made out of but it looks and feels extremely cheap. I'm sorry to leave a bad review but this shirt was not as well made as some of the others from this seller.",2
726667,I absolutely love the top! I am very small so it's difficult to find a top that looks good on me. The bottoms are too large so my only complaint is that I wish we could order the bottoms separately. Other than that I would have rated it 5 stars.,4
849021,"Not represented well in the pictures. The style is the same but the color is WAYYYY off. It's more of a light, sky blue. Not neon or turquoise in the slightest.
And the product is ridiculously small. I ordered the biggest size they had and it still didn't fit and I'm not huge either. Very disappointed. Luckily it fit my 14 year old niece so it didn't go to waste. It's too bad because the design is very pretty but they definitely need to retake pictures and stress on the size difference",2
647498,"This is adorable and comfy. I wear it all the time, although it could be a little more form-flattering. I have big boobs and it's still pretty wide at the bust. Also, it doesn't hug your hips. If you like baby doll dresses, it's nice but I think I'll sew it a little tighter",5
409243,"When I ordered this item the description clearly said ""suede"" handbag but it's faux suede.  Still, it's a nice roomy bag and I used it as a diaper bag while on vacation last year- so with the laced details and large brass rings it did look a lot more chic than my normal diaper bag.  Only one inner pocket so it's really hard to keep things organized.",3
226248,"The tights are cute but one size does not fit all. I am 5'4"" and weigh 110 pounds and these are too large for me. They look like they fit but give it about 10 minutes of walking around and the tights have slid down my legs and the bear design is halfway on my shin.",2
678163,"Love this wallet!  It is cute and very lightweight yet has a lot of space inside, including dividers, card slots, and zippered area, which make organizing items easy.  It did have a pretty noticeable odor when it arrived but it disappeared over time.  My all-time favorite wallet.",5
397357,"I like the Fossil removable links, so I can size my watch without a jeweler.  I like the water resistancy, so that I can shower without worry.  I like the sleek look.

I sometimes have a hard time with viewing the face.  Perhaps if the background weren't blue it would be easier, but the glare hides the hands.  It generally takes me a bit to figure out what my watch says because of this.",5
250781,I normally wear a XL to XXL but had to order a 6X by the size chart. I can close it on the first set of hooks but it's  a lot tighter than it should be. It's a good quality product. But the size is smaller than expected.  I hope  this helps someone when they make their decision.,3
699726,"I was so excited to get this maternity shirt for Mother's Day, i received a size large, which should have, by the size chart, been big on me.  I can only wear it with an undershirt, since it's too short my tummy hangs out if it. I wear a size four, im 5""6, so I think the shirt is just made for those very very short.",2
426313,"this is cute! yet when i wear it, it tends to bunch and slightly droop or fall. Im not a double D or anything (im a 34 A, yes im tiny lol) i though it would stay since im small, but it didnt. the elastic could be a bit tighter, but when wearing it i just have to hike it up a bit then im good to go!",3
255969,I purchased color 1. Not sure if it's coral or pink...but it's lovely. The other side has got a brown houndstooth type print.  This scarf is heavy almost like a blanket. It got to the US from China in a little over a week.  In excellent condition.  Perfect for cold weather. Very pretty.. It could be softer though...But still nice...,5
185128,"The dress wasn't too bad.  It fit as expected based on the size chart.  The split in the back is way too wide and large.  You would be able to wear it anywhere other than a nightclub.  Also, the dress had a terrible smell when I received them.  I have contacted the seller and will be returning the dresses ( I ordered 9 for a boutique)",3
2383,I am in love with these little mocs. They go great with any outfit or even just with a diaper and can be worn for long periods without becoming irritating to baby although I'm sure they must get warm because baby's feet are often a but sweaty after removing them.  When these first arrived the laces and fringes were a bit stiff but became more flexible with time and exposure to moisture. I would recommend them to anybody!,5
107927,"Product was as described and pretty much totally awesome, and a good price for what I've been seeing brooches at in other places.  The only concern I have after inspecting them is that the little pearl-coating on the flower-like brooch is a bit scratched off on the tippy-top (if where the pin is located is considered the bottom).

Overall, a good purchase and I will be using them for wedding things!  (dress/shoes/etc. mods).",4
146940,"Edit:
They are not adjustable like I thought, which is ok because the material is super stretch, but they do leave pretty good indents in my daughters head.

Exactly what I was looking for! They do leave a slight mark on my daughters head, but they fit nicely as is and are adjustable. (She is 2.5 mos) as you can tell by the picture, she loves it... they look sort of ridiculous but in a cute way",3
620083,I ordered a medium for my 14 yr old niece which is listed as a US 8-10. This is no where near the correct size; at least not in adult sizes. Instead it seems like this shirt is made to fit a small child. She ended up putting it on her teddy bear because it was so tiny. Don't waste your money on this.,1
473782,"I love these pants, they fit great and I love the mustard color.  I was worried the low cut would be a problem, but for me, they have been quite comfortable.  The fabric is on the lighter side, and slightly stretchy.  And they don't shrink in the wash.",5
408873,Very pretty bracelet and it is Italian made which is the best in silver. I never take it off and I love the lobster claw clasp with makes in very easy to take off and on if u decided not to wear it all the time. This is my third time I have ordered this bracelet because I love it so much.,5
265683,"These glasses fit very well both on my face and in place on top of my head when not in use. The lenses are very clear and the magnification perfect. I wish the glasses would have come in usable carrying cases rather than a thin drawstring bags and that the red were a little less loud and more subtle. I like the mixed brown pair most and would have liked color choices if possible. All in all though, the most important things were top notch.",4
736990,"Overall the dress is ok. My size is 10 I ordered large and fit ok, however, the finisihing of the dress is not what I expected. The inside need to be higher quality than what I received. I have to send it to professional to do the final finishing.
The dress looks nice, but it doesn't have ""waist""  the belt will make that waist. So you can't wear it without the belt otherwise, will look odd!!!",3
722653,"I have been using this purse for several months while traveling. It is perfect for daily use and sturdy. Can be used as a wristlet or a crossbody purse as well. Carries my credit cards and a little bit of cash. I can even put in a tube of lipstick. If I don't want to wear it as a purse, I use as a little wallet inside my bigger purse/tote. It holds my iPhone 7, too. I plan on purchasing this purse for Christmas gifts.",5
28773,"I was wearing regular insoles that I bought at the drugstore and they were not helping at all. By the end of the day it felt like I was walking on sharp stones. I was going to buy new shoes, but my shoes were only a couple of weeks old. I bought these insoles and they helped IMMENSELY. My heel was still painful at the end of the day, but not like it was. I have now added stretching my feet with resistance bands and the wearing the insoles and I am practically pain free!!",4
541386,"I purchased this t-shirt after seeing Buzz Aldrin wearing it. I'm an avid NASA enthusiast, and can't wait to see NASA make a trip to Mars!

The quality of the fabric is great. It is a durable cotton that washes well. The shirts are men's sizes and fit, not women's and run large.

However, the printing faded more than I expected it to after just the first wash. The shirt is going to outlast the printing.",4
404692,"I gave it to a friend of mine whose 2 year old grandson likes Led Zepplin. Of course it's a bit big on him, but I guess he really likes it.  He said the little guy runs and gets it and brings it out to him and says ""Zepplin"".",4
406144,"This is an absolutely beautiful ring. The picture does not do it justice. The setting is very delicate looking, not heavy, the diamonds are set well and the sapphire is fabulous. I purchased this for my daughter and she LOVES it! I'm very glad there are matching earrings and necklace! Go to the earrings description to look at a picture of the back of the setting. I wish they had one here.",5
755814,"Great handbag! I was looking for a ""bottle-green"" handbag, but ended up with this one even though it is a lighter army-green. This is a very nice bag for a even nicer price and has pockets for lots of stuff. I actually own a black and a brown in the same style. that are a little bit ""taller"" than this green one, but all are priced right for owning more than one color.",5
419315,"I ordered this top in both the medium and large.

The large fit as expected in the torso, but the sleeves are about 4"" too short.

The medium fit like a 1X in the torso, but the sleeves were perfect.

I don't mind the oversized one; I do mind the too-short sleeves.

I'll only reorder this if I'm ok with the risk that I'll get wacky sizing.",3
537089,Was very disappointed in this product. I washed it 2 times and ALL the lettering came off! Now it's just a black sweatshirt. My daughter was heart broken! She love that group we don't have a lot of money to spend on extras and this sweatshirt with this band meant a lot to her!,1
309281,"I should have returned this item, but had worn it under my bathing suit during water exercise class thinking it would provide the extra breast support I needed. Unfortunately, the bottom band was larger than expected and there was excess loose fabric in the bra area.  Very poorly made.  I ended up purchasing a sports bra that worked much better. I would not recommend purchasing this item.",1
400715,"This Christening outfit was the one I chose, simply because it fit the best, and was the most comfortable material for my 10 month old.  It was so comfortable that he slept through the entire Baptism.  I is a very well made garment but thin, and I didn't want baby to get hot. It worked for me, but the price is high.  I was willing to pay it, and the convenience of online shipping through amazon is amazing.",4
303985,I bought one size larger and they were so little small zipped it up and The zipper is made very cheap and snapped it so now I'm down one out of the five and not sure if I am going to try the other ones in hopes that they don't break,1
113619,The outfit runs somewhat large but it is advertised for size 16 - 22W and I'm on the small side of 16 so I guess it was going to be a little large anyway....It it well made and the tail attaches nicely to the back of the dress. Totally worth the money if you're looking for a cute costume without being too revealing.,4
431749,"After having to exchange this item two times due to defective workmanship or damaged parts, I finally received a fully-functional Darth Vader Force FX Lightsaber! I won't touch on what others like about this product, all I can say is this thing is awesome. Excellent sound-motion effects and it looks fantastic in a darkened room. If you're a Star Wars fan, you have to have one of these in your collection.",5
402638,"This is a good quality costume. MUCH better than what I was expecting. The hat needed some stitch removal and replacement to make it look right, but that took all of about 5 minutes and I am not sower. I already washed it and it still fits. It's going back in the storage bin for future use.",5
654405,"I got these for work so that I didn't have shiny metal visible. They went in easily and fit securely.  However, after wearing one of them for a week, the material started peeling and flaking.  The second one didn't seem to have the same issue.  The one that peeled also caused irritation in my eyebrow and it was very sensitive for several days.  Once switching back to my metal eyebrow ring, the problems resolved.",3
2049,"This helmet is part of the Aeromax Astronaut costume and while it is fun and has clever buttons on it, there is only one message that plays when you hit the button.  Secondly, the visor arrived broken.  Parts are cheap and cheaply put together.  Not worth the money.",2
33753,"Im going crazy over how great these socks are ,they're super comfy ,cute & totally worth it ! , the material is great , & i literally cant stop looking at myself in the mirror when i have them on , i had originally bought them as a little show for my boyfriend , & he certainly wasn't disappointed he loves them & so do i , Im totally buying some more , my money was well spent !",5
823862,"At the time I bought this swimsuit, I usually wore a size XS in tops (I was a 32C when I bought it), but I went up a size like the comments said to do and bought a small. The top was WAY too small. Half of my breasts fell out the bottom. The bottoms were fine though, they fit as expected but the style of the top was the main reason I bought this swim suit.",2
58280,"I was super excited about the design but it came with scratches all ready on the outside of the wallet.  About 2 months into having it, one side of the wallet part started to pull away from the inside and there is now a huge rip.  I try not to buy leather but I am feeling like I should of now.  I will not buy from Iron Fist again.",1
139933,"i only wore it once for 6 or 7 hours  for prom. If you get your size you should be fine. Personally, I have small boobs so it work great for me.
If somebody with larger  boobs, it may not have the same experience due to the weight of ther boobs.",5
404371,Just recieved my ring in the mail the other day. I have yet to wear it but I can't wait. The ring is a perfect fit on my finger. I pray the ring doesn't turn pink or green after a few months but for only $40 this was a great buy.,4
98226,"These are quite comfortable for light compression maternity stockings. I would not call them leggings, as they are more like tights than pants. However, they help with my varicose veins, and are comfortable to wear. They are a bit long, but I just pull the bottom edge under the heels of my feet. They gather at the ankles slightly, probably because of this, but aren't as bad as some compression stockings I've tried. I purchased a size small and am 5'6"".",4
2821,"This ring may be on the ""cost effective"" side of things, but it doesn't matter: it is beautiful.  The thin band is very comfortable, and the cubic zirconia is exactly the right size and shape for this setting.  I think this is a ring that any girl would love.  It works well as a promise ring, a ""thinking about you a lot"" ring, or just an ""I still like you"" ring.  The price is low, but with a ring this pretty, it really doesn't matter.",5
551210,"The blouse was too small and short. I am Asian and petite and it fit too snug. I am 5'1"" and a size six with a average chest (34c). The chest looked like it was going to rip apart and it fell a little above the hip, so when I lifted my arms it showed a lot of midriff. Not a very professional look. My husband had to help me out of it and I ended up giving to a friend's daughter who is twelve.",1
713451,"I read the reviews before I bought and some of them warned that the vest pockets are very small to the point that you can't fit your hand in them, but my vest came with no pockets at all. The zippers do zip and unzip but there is nothing behind the zipper. The silver buttons don't open either. Disappointing because the fit is good and it looks nice. I'm on the fence about keeping it or sending it back.",3
468426,My husband has big hands and yet this still fit him fine.  He does alot of fine work w/ his hands and his fingers get cold and stiff.  These helped him so much that I got a pair for my self.  I think they are GREAT.  You can still do the fine work but your hands stay warm and toasty.,5
126576,"We ordered these suspenders for my son to wear to a family friend's wedding and they were a big hit!  Not only did my son like them but he received a lot of comments from the other guests as well.  And yes, they work well at keeping the pants in place!",5
316130,I absolutely love Pajama Jeans. For someone who suffers with a severe nickel allergy from zippers and buttons PJ's give me the freedom to wear them and look like I'm wearing jeans. I would love to give a full 5 star rating but if I'm truly giveing an honest opinion the Pajama Jeans are a little pricey. That is the only reason why I am not giving the extra star.,4
811709,"I bought these leggings thinking that they would be somewhat baggy since I have very thin legs and I wanted them to fit that way.  Most leggings do bag on me. These did not.  Additionally, they had to stretch so much that they were see through.  Wasn't what I expected and I returned them.",2
261237,"WAY TO SMALL . If you are actual plus size woman that wears a XXXL , DO NOT buy ! I absolutely loved the shirt the moment I bought online , didn't even question it , I knew I had to have . Just extremely disappointed that i can't wear .",1
798412,"Very yellow gold, husband thought it was very ugly. Measurements where off, very disappointed. I know it's hard to gage a review and relate it to your size/situation but this is honestly a cheaply made dress and more of a costume that's is not worth the $70+ it's listed for. Had high hopes and was let down.",1
212230,"I loved this dress, initially. It'll be perfect throughout and after my pregnancy. One effing issue: the seams come out easily; even on gentle wash and air dry. I'm not too upset unless it continues then I'll have to return it. Trust me, I do want to love this dress. I ordered a Medium; I'm 5'; 3mo preg and 136lbs. If I decide to exchange it, instead of return it, I'll be ordering a Small as a replacement.",4
541075,Have to wait almost 45 days for this scarf. Once i got it it doesn't look like in the picture at all. The knitting is much looser and the pattern is not exactly look alike on the model. good length but still isn't look like what i ordered. This quality of scarf i could get anywhere under 10usd.,1
827352,I got the large and they fit a size 10-12 adult quite comfortably.  They are super plush but LIGHTWEIGHT and not for the very cold temps - I wore them out to walk the dog one night and the wind blew right through the fabric and it was cold.  Great for lounging around the house.,5
98022,"This shirt looks nothing like the picture, or at least mine did! I thought there was a mistake and I had opened someone else's package. It was horrible. It literally looks like the top to a pair of long johns! It also had buttons at the neck in the front which were off center on the shirt! I can't say enough about this horrible item. DO NOT BUY THIS!! But you get what you pay for and I didn't feel like going to the drama of packaging it back up and returning it!",1
611707,"These sandals are so adorable!  I received quite a few compliments on them.  I ordered a size 8 which is what I generally wear, and they fit as expected.  Sadly, they didn't hold up well though.  I wore them probably 2-4 times a week, but they didn't last the full summer.  I'm used to my sandals lasting at least 2 summers, so maybe my expectations are too high.  I would still order them again though, considering the price is reasonable.",4
125096,"The only problem for me, is the bill of the hat needs to be another 2"" wider. I have lots of skin cancer on the face and need to cover my ears more. But other than that its a wonderful hat. If you have that type of hat, please let me know?",4
685855,"I love this dress! I bought the white apricot navy. The colors are great together. I've received many compliments. I'm typically a size 4 and bought a medium. Perfect fit. I'm 5'1"" so the length isn't an issue for me. It's so light and soft and has an a-line fit.",5
520979,"Absolutely gorgeous! The ring is exactly as pictured. I love the Medieval style.  Yes, it is a larger and heavier band but that is what I have been searching for. I have very small hands and dainty rings look silly on me. No half sizes, so I went up from my 6.75 to a 7. The style of ring makes that a comfortable choice. Worth waiting for it to become available again!",5
611296,"It fit ok. They sock part of the sheo is just to stretchy and lose that he can't even walk in them. Luckely I can sew and fix this issue. But I wish i didn't have to. So buyer beware they are very hard to walk in. I have had any other brands of these types of sheos and never had an issue until now. My son is normal in size and weight, and his feet are even alittle chunky.",1
45021,"If you love Stargate Atlantis, and want everyone to know it while maintaining your classy vibe, this is the necklace for you! It's very shiny, and I've gotten many compliments from Stargate fans and sad unknowing lame-wads alike! I thought the length of the chain looked dumb, but I shortened it, and that was really easy. I never take it off, and the material has not been damaged at all.",5
602491,I like the dress so much. It fits as expected. I am 5ft and usually X-small or small fits me well. It was size 4 and I expected that it will be little lose at breast area. But that is ok for me. I had used an extra bra underneath. Although this dress comes with inbuilt bra. Thats why giving this dress 4 stars. If your breast size is little bit up then go for it.,4
413164,"These boots looked nice but after wearing them only 3 timed the sole came off at the heal on the right boot took it to my wonderful shoe guy Billys on lebanon Rd in Hermitage Tn and he fixed it, two weeks later the left sole came off and I just threw them away.",1
408207,"This is my 3rd pair of the ""nude"" color of these fishnets.  I live in California and find them a great wear-to-work option.  They are much hipper than too old-fashioned pantyhose, but you still have some cover.  For me the first place to rip is usually the crotch seams.  I've actually never had a tear/run in the hose part.",4
244124,"I got this as a gift for my boyfriend. He likes it, it's a nice light jacket that will keep you warm but won't make you hot. The only complaint he had is that there are no pockets anywhere on this jacket, which I didn't realize when I ordered it. No big deal, he still wears it. Just be aware if that's a deal breaker for you.",3
86977,"I was looking specifically for a purple chiffon dress with sleeves and I decided to give this dress a try because of the affordability. I'm 5'4"" and it's a little shorter than I hoped. The lining is a little on the flimsy side and sort of a silky shiny pinkish-purple material which I didn't expect though it looks just fine under the chiffon. My package included the off-white belt which was a welcome bonus. All in all I'm satisfied for what I paid for the dress.",4

The only reason I named the items to give you what this bag can hold. I think the price is a steal. Also I like it because it's light weight,my leather ones are heavy. I don't think you can go wrong buying this bag.",5
242265,"Recently I lost my white gold wedding band and was looking for a replacement.  This ring is on the whitish tone like real white gold vs. others in Tungsten which have black tint.  The ring is comfort fit, true to size, and right weight - gives that solid feel.  I am very happy with purchase.",5
475188,These are very heavy and thick and would not be good for running around indoors at a play place or something.  They are lined with a heavy faux fur.  They were also way too big.  It does not say that these are lined in the description and were not what I was expecting.,3
320663,"The clasp on the chain is a little flimsy, but overall I really like this piece!  It looks exactly as it does in the photo pictured in the item listing.  The individual stones are tiny, but I liked this design compared to some other styles I have seen for a chakra necklace.  The item arrived very quickly and I'm happy with the purchase - would recommend to anyone considering a chakra necklace.",4
429871,"This is a beautiful dress, I normally hate one shoulder dresses but I thought I'd give this a try, and it exceeded my expectations. The fit was perfect and comfortable. The only down side was that it would snag easy, I think it's because I hugged a lot of friends who wore beaded dresses, so don't stand near or hug anyone wearing a beaded dress. Other than that it is beautiful, especially for the price!",5

I found these after choking on the cost of replacing them with Oakley brand lenses that had to made with some Platinum polymer to justify the price.  These were the closest match to my original lenses and side by side, I can't tell the difference.  They fit the Flax Jacket XLJ perfectly.  I've already ordered a couple of different colors/variants.  Nice to have some options that don't suck the wallet dry.",5
171067,"....but it's not so much so that I cannot wear the product. It's made very well, and the elastic stretches nicely, while still 'pulling' in. I'm not used to all the clips ( that will come with time, I imagine! ) but it's extremely comfortable to wear. I feel it around my waist, but I have no difficulty moving ( or breathing ) with it on. I look forward to continued used of this corset!",4
802967,"Ok now these are my absolute favorite. I'm not into shorts but I love capri pants. I also do not like my butt or thighs jiggling at all! These capris are thick and super supportive. They are better than any other capri I have EVER owned. And yea I have owned the famous name brand ones that are $100+ a pair, I can not survive without these in my wardrobe. They was well and retain their color without fading. I have them in grey and black. Did I mention how much I love these yet?!?!?!?!  A+++++",5
37467,"You get what you pay for. This product was big enough, but poorly made.  There was no elastic in the waistband to actually keep the tights on my waist. Additionally, the groin area appeared to be cut to accommodate male parts...not sure what was going on with the pouch there. The stripes were cute, so it's a shame.  Would return if I could.",1

Unfortunately, a gem has fallen out and I have had to clean it twice because muck gets stuck on the inside where the gems are sitting. I am currently on the market for a new one but I will definitely keep this one near.",3

The print on the has nothing to do with the one on the picture. On the picture is a delicate baroque design and the one I received is thick and doesn't even look like flowers. The black waist line is just an elastic band. Not worth the $20 some dollars. Oh and to top it off it had a slit in the back...",1

It's not exactly what I was looking for, but as a bright, cheerful, vacation-at-the-beach kind of bag? It's perfect.

My only real complaint is that it looks like it has a woven grass texture from the picture, and it doesn't. And that's all my fault, I should have read the description more closely.",4
90493,The Nickel Free Italian Sterling Silver Necklace is perfect for more delicate pendants. The latch is easy to open and close. I don't have to keep turning it around my necklace and look in the mirror to see if I can open or close the latch.  This necklace is easy to open as well as ZilverZoom Sterling Silver necklaces.,5

Bottom line is, after much walking, these do not slip off of the heel. Also, these are true no show socks where you cannot see them under most shoes, including boat type shoes. Be careful to follow their size guidelines to the letter and you should have no problems. I wish all products were this precise.",5
225735,"I got the white one and I love it! It's lightweight and came earlier than expected. It is from China so it'll take a while but I think it's worth it! The price is very reasonable. The tag says a larger size than you buy but the sellers tell you to ignore the size on the tag and why. Overall it's a great product and if you get this product, I hope you enjoy it :) I guess it all depends on personal preference on how you'll like it.",5
244047,I am disappointed in the way it was constructed. I am a sewer myself. When I went to press it I discovered that one of the sleeves kept bunching up. I had to open the sleeve lining and resew it. There were loose threads around each button hole. One button came off after one wearing. All in all the workmanship was not what I expected .,3
466975,"i love the design of how each utensil curves so that they all fit together as a unit. And though i don't see myself clipping this to my belt or backpack, i like the cloth case that this comes in. I use this everyday for work. This is exactly what I was looking for.",5
678927,"Boots fit as experted, though a little loose around the ankles. They are somewhat comfortable. The color is a disappointment, they are a lot grayish in reality compared to the photo (I bought the taupe). They also have a very chemical smell (somehow I was expecting leather, but since it didn't say anywhere what they were made off, I should have expected they were not). Fast delivery and great price though.",3
455821,"I'm always weary of buying clothes online, because even-though you know your size sometimes that particular brand maybe too big or too small. However, this was perfect, and I love how long it is. It goes just below the pockets which is how I usually like my shirts. I would definitely recommend this, since the shipping was quick as usual and it look just like the picture. I know how sometimes the picture looks better than the shirt well not in this case.",5

Handles/straps feel so soft, don't dig into shoulders as they are very wide. It fits 5 notebooks, 2 large folders, iPad. Female essence and still does not get bulky. I can't wait to start receiving complements on my new tote tomorrow at my college.",4
402029,"I got this because it reminded me a little of the one I wore for 8 years in the Marines.  It of course it a lot better quality and is made of Silver, but it has that same feeling.  It is definitely different, but I really like it.  I added a charm/pendant to it to add some weight to the front of it and I think it have a very unique look to it.  Great price and value.",5
463316,"Just a good tshirt! This is charged cotton, so it is not truly exercise wear (tho my son does wear it to soccer practice sometimes). It is soft and true to size. The color is vibrant, just like online and has not lost it's color over 20+ washes (did not shrink or lose softness either). Overall, just a terrific shirt.",5
691754,"I find this item to be a waste of money. Not only do you have order 1-2 sizes larger than normal, but the quality doesn't hold up. I purchased this item the end of November 2015. It is now 2-11-2016 and the coat is falling apart. The zipper broke, the back seam is splitting and it looks old and shabby.",1
299280,"Extremely flimsy, if you're serious about waist training pass this one up and splurge a little more. If you're just looking for a waist cincher to put under your clothes then this is a cheap one that could work a few times. Hooks are very flimsy and I bent one putting it on the very first time so put it on carefully.",3

I ended up just wearing it a few hours every day for the first hour and found that it really did impact how much I ate for the day. I also jogged with it on and found the jogging easier than usual. Not sure if these are lasting result of this waist trainer, but I definitely am enjoying it!",4
647450,"Really cute, but too big and too long. Bought two for my twin nieces. They're 8, and I bought size 7/8. Looks like the outfit would fit a 10 or 11 year old instead. They'll grow into it though. Nice material for warm weather. Can't wait for them to actually enjoy it. Maybe they'll be able to fit into the romper next year.",5
204379,"These earrings are nothing as to what I expected, I'm 6 foot one, 200 pounds , and these are not even close to being considered men's earrings . They may fit a small girl, but not even close for an adult  The crossbar is way too short , and the hoops are too small and won't even allow my earlobe to fit in between them",1
471868,Very long and there were no holes remotely close to my waist size. I took a gamble on this - was cheap enough to justify it.. It was so long I could wrap it around myself twice! I would say the belt is at least a size med/large. Didn't wear this but not worth it to go thru the bother of returning. Oh well,1
329355,"Although this product fit a bit smaller than expected, it was definitely a very warm and comfortable  sweater. I usually buy a large because I like to have a little wiggle room, but a large fit snugly like medium sweater would have. Overall a great sweater, but the size ran a little small. I should have bought the XL. If the size was what I expected, then I would have rated this a 5 star item.",4
212322,"Fits perfectly!!  I purchased the OS size, normally I wear a large or 10/12 depending on the dress, but opted for OS. Material is buttery soft, airy, and fits comfortably without being too snug around the mid-section. I'm 5'8 and this dress falls just about the ankles. I'm pleased that the elastic around the sleeves aren't tight and are very comfortable. This dress is a bit see through so I would suggest a half slip, shorts, or leggings be worn underneath. Considering buying in another color also!",5
380310,"Returning. Note, this dress is not flattering on busty women - granted I am rediculously busty at a solid 36M, with a very hourglass figure, but even on my sister in law - someone less busty - the dress sat awkward.. Like it flares out way too high. It looks great in some of the pictures of smaller ladies, but even though it comes in larger sizes, I'm not positive this dress works well for some of us gals who are .. Err.. More filled out.",3
499413,"Nice ring with good size stones.  Actually it is more red than garnet or ruby colored but that's ok.  If it were real rubies very few could afford it.  However, I would like the stones to be more garnet dark red.  No packaging as it came in a small clear plastic zip bag.",4

447967,I ordered a pink poodle from S& D KIDS through Amazon. The order form shows I ordered  pink but they sent a yellow one. Got it for my granddaughter for Easter. She lives 1500 miles away. I'm going to fill it with presents and mail it to her. Too late to send it back and get the right color. If I had the right color I would give it 5 stars. Her favorite color is pink. Other than getting the wrong color it's adorable.,3
495608,"As far as diabetic socks go, these are fun when compared to the usual plain and dull-looking ones. They fit well but are on the thin side, which is preferable when wearing regular shoes as opposed to sneakers or sport shoes. For those with sensitive toes, they are not seamless. The shipping was unbelievably fast, coming all the way from the UK (I think). I do like these socks!",4
271545,It rides up and I constantly have to pull it back down throughout the day.  I intended to wear it under dresses that are more sheer so you can't see through the fabric but it really works better as a tank top since it rides up so much.  If I could do it again I would have invested in one that was a little more expensive in the hopes the quality was better and I wouldn't have issues with adjusting all day.,3
257725,I ordered the stitch one.. Was a lil worried to fork up that much on Jammies for my daughter but they are so worth it!!  Super plush just like a good quality stuffed animal.. Will be ordering more characters as long as they have the same fabric.. I ordered a cat one also .. I think from another seller and it was fleece fabric.. Nice.. But not compared to the stitch character,5
284189,I work for Disney where pins are prevalant as a collectable. I must say even though it's not a disney pins I get many compliments. People know exactly what it is and is shiny as the white and black paint is on some sort of polished metal. In all a nice pin for a pin enthusiast.,5

The bag became unusable. The same thing happened to the larger red one.",1
333595,"Wow, I really expected to hate these but they are nice looking and very comfortable. I usually wear 34 30 jeans and the medium fits ok, a little tight in the thigh, but the material is stretchy so no problem. One thing I noticed over the typical jeans I wear are that these are high waisted. For me, they would look strange if I tucked in a shirt but I will wear these with shirts out and they will be great. Also, the fly is fake so you have to pull them down, bummer.",4
633491,I ordered an extra large as I wear 34H bras. I am otherwise small. The top fits however the sleeves are really tight and i don't have big arms. Was a little disappointed but I'll have to make it work as it came from so far. Wouldn't make sense to return.,3
741674,"Ordered this right before the holidays as a gag thing to wear. Ordered a men's medium, ended up the size was a s/m and I almost feel it was a women's cut. The sleeves and waist were way too short and it was tight. I probably needed a medium large, but it wasn't specified in the description.",1

I had these shorts shipped to me in Buena Vista,  VA during my AT thru-hike last year and wore them everyday to Katahdin. Other than the logo wearing off they're still basically new. If you want the feel of being naked while running or hiking or going to a music festival without actually being offensively actually naked there is no better product than BOA. I'll be wearing my new pair on the PCT next year for sure!",5
328132,I gave this ring 2 stars not because it isn't beautiful it is but as soon as I got it out of the package one of the little stones fell out. I bought this ring thinking I could wear it for a while without buying another .. But  I'm thinking I will be purchasing a different one very shortly ..  I would recommend a different ring.,2
615831,"This skirt is very pretty. The color is true to the image (I got the light pink). But the waistline is a mess. I mean it's so bad you need to find a way to cover it. The elastic is all janky and lopsided. It looks like a home-ec project done by a 12 year old. Get a belt or something else that can cover it up. No self respecting adult would wear that waist band. I would give it 1 star, but it's so cheap I feel like this is a ""get what you pay for"" situation.",3
461876,"I wanted the shirt as part of a costume, and this looks like it will work perfectly.

I am a US size 0-2. I read the sizing description and ordered a medium, and it fits me exactly. I even have shoulder room, which is usually a problem for me.

The fabric is a little cheap, as expected of the price. Buttons are plastic and a little large for the holes, and the lace is embroidered netting. I don't expect this to be durable, but it looks very nice if not examined too closely.",4
872629,"Quite long, and longer in back than front which isn't visible in stock pic. Nice drape and ruffles. Works as a stand alone and as an extender layer.

So I returned it and while I was looking for rings, I came across this one on Amazon. So far, it looks great, feels a little heavy (but I think thats just the tungsten) and was substantially cheaper than my old one. I'd recommend it for people who are looking for a cheaper wedding band that they can wear daily.",5
217944,"The sizing chart isn't quite right. I ordered an XL, which should have been plenty big enough, and it's too small.

Also, the button holes were not completely cut out, so I would have had to risk cutting the material to get them open enough to button it (which I couldn't do anyway). Note: the buttons on this are white plastic and make it look peculiar. I think they should have been black or pink. I returned the item.",1

Shame on this company for misrepresenting their product so grossly, and shame on Amazon for doing business with them.",1

The sizing runs pretty small and they aren't very stretchy in the hand area so they can be hard to get over baby hands.

It is made of tee-shirt weight material.  A person 5ft 6in or taller could probably look nice in it. The seller was very cooperative in returning the item.",3
75455,Used this product as needed throughout my pregnancy. I never had to buy maternity pants. It fit as expected. Looking back maybe I could have gone smaller to make it tighter but it held my pants fine. I used it with my dress pants and jeans. I folded it a little different than I think your supposed to so it wouldn't leave button indents on my body. I basically had this product against my skin under my pants then folded over the pants.,5
410777,"Not worth even the small amount of money I paid.  Because the frame of the buckle is leather, it wears out very quickly; and after one month or less the prong slips through the buckle frame and the whole belt pops loose!!  There are many better stretchable belts out there.  Buy one with an all-metal buckle.",1
42999,"the quality is consistent and fine.  i got a light correction which is really great for the computer/internet, and a plus i don't have to
panic and remove the glasses when i get up from the chair.  quite tolerable.  i finally had the time when i couldn't lay my hands on a pair so hey, just reach in the drawer and get another !",5
758838,"i like them, they aren't noticeable. great if you need to hide it for work. there might be a slight tiny dot in the middle because the barrel part of the plastic casts a shadow when you put it in but its not really noticeable and u could always but a dab of foundation or powder",5
380914,"I love these! I have a small chest (32B/34A), and I have always wanted to go braless. These allow me to go braless and not worry about showing too much. They stick on easy and come off easy with no pain. If you are thinking about purchasing, purchase them! You will not regret it. I will order more.",5
75676,"I love this product!  I used it at the beginning of my pregnancy to cover up the fly of my pants that I wasn't able to zip up.  As my pregnancy progressed, I've been using it to keep my shirts protected from all of the lotions and oils I've been slathering on my growing stomach.  It's machine washable....and I've washed it many times and haven't had any issues.  There is a rubber lining at the bottom that helps keep the belly band in place - this is still in good condition after so many washes.",5
428883,It's pretty as the red one of its kind that I purchased but the seam in the back of the head is off and there's a tiny hole in it. I will sew it but it was disappointing since the first hat was absolutely perfect. It was $5 cheaper than the first hat I bought so maybe it was a defective lot.,2
742013,This is great for that day at the beach and so comfy.  The material breaths well and will work for a variety of body sizes.  This is now a staple in my beach Vacation wardrobe but it's also going to be a spring and summer go to when it warms up here.,5
876324,"I was looking for a trendy camo shirt, i.e. not the hunting camo. This looked to be perfect but isn't printed well. The lighter colors are hardly visible on the shirt which makes it look more like a zebra print than camo. I can't recommend this if you're looking for camo..",3
342717,"Design: So unique that people easily recognize me by looking at my bag. Very feminine.
Size: Perfect size to comfortably hold my wallet, checkbook, glasses, cell phone, a compact, lipstick and comb.
Material: Typical canvas-type material. The strap hangs comfortably off my shoulder. Very lightweight.
Overall: Cute crossbody and decent quality.
I really love it! By the way, I never wrote any reviews for product before, but I had to write this because this bag is really awesome :D Hope this review is helpful!",5
161799,"Got the dress and could only think.
1. Is this made by the same company that makes Halloween costumes , because it resembles that oh so festive costume shine.
2.where do my boobs go? The slit in the front would even cover half of my breast and fit tightly everywhere else like it does in the picture.....soooooooo guess it's another Amazon fail lol.",1
804048,"I received my Valdler Velvet Jewelry Display stand just 2 days after ordering it. It holds necklaces, earrings, rings & bracelets. It comes with one pk of beaded needles to help hold the jewelry to the board. The velvet board has a sponge layer in the middles so it's soft. This helps keep your jewelry organized and nicely displayed. Necklaces stay tangled free.

I received this item free for my honest and unbiased review. I would recommend this item to anyone looking to display their jewelry.",5
569837,This is a great piece.  I was disappointed that it arrives as a gold color instead of silver as it appears in the picture.  Makes a great summer accent and gave it as a gift to a friend that wears scarves years around...so she has a great summer scarf,4
431529,"The material is soft, the color is true to the picture, and the design is great, but the sizing is WAY off. I went by the item description and size charts and ordered accordingly. When I got the pants and tried them on, I could barely get them over my thighs. The material has no give whatsoever. I really wish that these would have worked out. If you're considering ordering these for yourself, I'd suggest ordering at least one size up. The feel, color, and design are the only reasons that I'm giving these two stars instead of one.",2
520800,"Beautiful embroidery in lovely colors.  Excellent cut and size seems on target. I take a 2x on top and petite bottom....sometimes tunics can look a bit ""heavy"".  This one, however, hangs well, comes to low hip on my 5'3"" and will generally be fun to wear. The only reason that I didn't rate this a five is because the fabric is a little thin and I'll have to iron it. As a child of the 60's, I find that the blouse evokes great memories.  I can almost hear Dylan singing!",4
76850,"Superior vision at night and during rain storms. Clarity is so amazing... I am getting so use to wearing them, I sometimes forget to take them off and leave them in the truck. Highly recommend these if you have trouble seeing in rain storms or have a problem with headlights while night driviing.",5
30949,These pants were absolutely weird. I feel like I was wearing sweatpants/bellbottoms from the 70s. They were entirely too big.  Felt like almost 2 sizes too big. They did not have a size stitch inside so I could not identify the correct size that was sent to me.  Once again I was on able to send back because I did not open until the return date had expired....smh.  What a waste of money.,1
852399,"I actually really like the look and fit of this top, I was however surprised by the material. I didn't read the product description well enough apparently and was expecting maybe a linen/cotton/polyester blend. Its actually a somewhat stretchy material that I can imagine my mom or grandma wearing. Nevertheless it's a cute cut and pretty design so I will keep it. Next time I will read the product material a little better. I did receive this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.",4
220998,"This is really nice.  I ordered it in the light orange/brown leather to match a bag I have. The leather is nice and soft, and has that worn in look like my bag does.  The zipper seems like a good one.  The price also seemed good for the quality compared to others I looked at.  Now I feel dressy and not like such a schmo compared to my fellow law school classmates.",5
490752,"It's a little big on me but it's comfortable, I am 5 foot and weigh about 125 with a D cup. Going smaller with boobs as big as mine would have been a pain because the shirt is hard to get over my head already. But it is a pretty shirt, you just have to iron the v in the front because some of it buldges after the 1st wash.",4
675663,So cute!  I love the alligator!  It is my grandson's favorite.  It does shrink a bit.  My grandson is 16 mos.  I ordered the 24 mos and it was a tight fit after it was washed.  But the 2T was perfect.  I ordered at least 5 different pairs.,5
75656,"I had a band from Target that was great, but it started to ride up in the back as my butt got bigger. The silicone strip on this one is well worth the increased price. I hate maternity pants because I always feel like they are falling down. These bands will enable be to wear my regular pants right up to delivery.",5
251069,"If you're looking at American sizes, go a size down from your actual size. When I got mine, it was a bit too big and even on the third hook, it was still a little loose.

Mine took about 4 business days to come by the way. It came faster than expected.",4
746212,"This cardigan is nice. The drapey front is fun, it's soft, lightweight, and I bought black which will go with many different outfits. I am normally a large in women's shirts and ordered a 2XL which fits nicely. The only downside is that it's a bit short in length, the back of the cardigan stops right before my bum. I'm 5'4"" for reference.  Full disclosure: I recieved a discount for writing a review.",4
102668,"I really do not like this very much. The stitching is super cheap, looks tacky, and does nothing for the overall effect. The only thing I like is the poplin material that comes out of the dryer ready to wear.

Bottom line: it looks cheap and I don't like looking cheap! I ordered two, one in white and one in purple, I think. My comments apply to both.",1
355716,"Great deal!  Glasses are well made and case quite sturdy (stands up to all of the stuff I keep in my purse).  My face is somewhat narrow so they fit perfectly.  Might be a little tight for a rounder, or fuller face structure.  Will definitely purchase again so I can spread out the pairs among the house.",5
763083,"This purse is a great size, easily fits over your body and will lay flat.  I have had mine for about 8 months now and have washed it several times.  The color and shape are holding great.  The leather strap is adjustable and has a quiet metallic sheen.  I just love this purse, I use it every day.",5
373072,"Incredibly comfortable and easy to walk in AFTER you break them in. Great for people with wider feet. However, after having them for 2 months and wearing them maybe 10 times, the pads/caps on the bottom of both heels have already broken/worn off. I work in an office so its not like I walk even walk much in them. Extremely disappointed because these are so cute and fit so well.",3
818693,"Product is great, was looking for this specific style case, in the color I like. I've had these cases save my phones from multiple drop bounces on pavement and not have a scratch. Minus 1 star because I could only find it in China this time and took over 6 weeks for delivery.",4
674862,"The jacket was great. It came really fast seeing as it was coming from another country, and the detail also looks exactly like the picture besides the material. It was of this silky polyester or something, somewhat like the material of a swimsuit. This, actually was the only fault in the jacket.",3
683224,"I ordered a small and it was huge. I'm a size two and this was at least a size 6 or 8. Definitely runs way big. Maybe it's vanity sizing but I was really disappointed. Too big to even alter to fit. for reference the small is 28"" in the waist and it's super stretchy so it should fit someone with a 30"" waist.",2
44068,"Purchased these for my great grandson's birthday and he loved them. Well made, sturdy, looks like they will last a long time. He wore them to preschool and all the children had a hard time keeping their hands off - smile.  If you are giving thought to ordering, I recommend without hesitation.",5
686822,These were totally NOT what the picture showed! The pinks and greens are orange and blue! The pants were about 4 inches too short when I put them as low as I can get them. There is this weird gathering section at the front waistband seam and there is nothing loos about the lower leg like the pics suggest. The honestly looked like they were done by someone who had never sewn before. Awful!,1
460238,"When I saw this white halter dress online, I was like oh yes I finally found it. When it arrived I said what is this? The material was so thin you can see thru it and the lining was cut in half... who does that. Not sure if I would buy dresses from amazon again.",1
169397,"More than anything. Backpacker magazine raves huge about these and it sucked me in. In premise, the design seems sound and the fit is generally good.  However, if your a long hauler like a marathoner, alpine climber or through hiker, only get them if you like a chaffed d! ck h3ad.  That pouch in the front sounds like good idea, but it allows too much movement on the man parts!  There are better products like Exofficio that fit to your body better.",2
214226,"I bought a size up but it was unnecessary. Buy your normal size. It should fit snugly. It's a nice fabric, lightweight, nice pattern. Of course for $20 it's not the best vest in the world, but great for what I need it for. It will need to be pressed or steamed because it's badly creased from storage and shipping. Also the clasp on the back will not stay in place. I figure I'll put a stitch or two in it to keep it in place.",4
431270,"This case isn't even close to the same case pictured.  If you are at all concerned about color, do not buy this case!
The case that arrived was a faded lifeless lilac color vs. the one pictured as a vibrant purple with animal print.
This is the most blatant misrepresentation I have ever experienced on Amazon.
I may return it purely out of principle .",1
121427,"I read the previous reviews about the top being too small but I gave it a try.  Don't waste your time and money.  The xl would only work if you wear a training bra. The skirt is cute, but the top is poorly made and seriously would only fit a size A.",1
761261,"I had one of these Balaklava's years ago, and lost it.  Like losing sunglasses.  Got this for me, then remembered how warm they keep you in cold winters, and got some for my Sister and her family.  They are essential for really cold and windy.  Of course, if you have issues mussing up your hair, you won't like these.  Me, I'm a bald man, so; it isn't a problem for me. LOLOL!",5
121315,This hat is adorable.  The ties are nice and long so you can tie them in a bow under her chin.  The brim is nice and big so it really provides a lot of sun protection.  I would recommend this to anyone - and there is a matching swim diaper which is also adorable.,5
817843,Love shoe the only complaint I have was that one of the lights just started changing color on its own when on I reported but they just directed me to recharge and take out battery which I was not going to do and make worse!! Other than that shoe is well made just a shame that lol guy is not working!!!!!,5
233236,"Quick delivery!! Needed this dress last minute for a wedding, order the size you normally would wear, fits perfectly. The ruffle in the front is a little longer than I thought but it looks exactly like the picture. Color is exact. Would recommend and will probably get it black! Thank you!",4
685952,"Purchased the yellow dress for my prince's first birthday party, & I really like it. I followed the reviews & went up a size & it fits great. I'm an exact size 4 & purchased a medium. I'm also 5""7 & the dress is a bit too long without heels. Great material, a little on the heavy side so you know it's not cheaply made, & overall a great buy.",5
67414,"Ring is not as green as I had hoped and when I first took it out of the box, it had a weird black stain on the ring.  We used some jewelery cleaner on it and it came out.  Not sure if it was from the box or what? I would like to maybe find another ring and see if the experience is the same.",3
399480,"Do not be tempted by the low price.  I ordered 7 role playsets for a birthday party.  4 arrived damaged.  The helmet is very stratched when it arrives in the box.  Poor packaging both for toy and shipping.  Easy to get replacements sent in time for party, if you like contact with a computer NOT a real person.  Of the replacements 1 was damaged on arrival.  I now have the inconvenience of shipping at least 4/5 of these playsets back.  WOULD NOT ORDER AGAIN.",1
813333,Super cute - I bought in 2 patterns. I am 5'0 110lbs and 25 waist and bought both the XS and S. I wore both low rise and the small showed no velcro while the xs did but had a better fit. Kept them both because it's hard to find a super low rise bottom and these work because the velcro is adjustable.,5
569124,"This clutch was absolutely beautiful.  I loved it - its only fault was that I could not fit my iPhone 6+ in it.  I had seen varying responses about phones in the comments, but I liked it so well that I tried it.  Unfortunately, it was a little small.  But if you have a smaller phone, it is gorgeous!",4
84924,"I love this dress.  Very nice-looking dress, well made.  Cute design, with the working zipper.  This is not such a loose dress.  I am 4-10, usually a size 10, and in Allegra K blouses of this sort of material, the large is usually quite roomy.  This dress is a bit smaller.  I got a large, and washed it once already, and it is form fitting on the bottom and a bit roomy on top.  I wear with leggings and boots.  I wish they had a shorter sleeved version for the summer!",5
405266,"In March I bought 2 of these bags to go to Alaska on an Expedition. The bags were perfect for what we were required to take (i.e. knee high boots, etc.) They were so good that someone stole the 2 bags in Chicago. We are yet to recover them. (one and a half months and still counting)",5
468048,"this is very well made and seems like it will last along time. the colors are bright and I love it. It kinda feels like spandex or like silky legging material, idk how to explain it, but its nice and cool so I like it in the Texas heat. over all its a good product. shipping was really fast too, I got it like a day or two after ordering it",5
157787,"This product does have a strong chemical smell but not more so than other nylon stockings.  And that is basically what these are, heavy stockings.  This is to be worn under a skirt or a long tunic, which is exactly what I needed.  Good product.  I just wish the White was available in Large. Hint Hint.",4
618992,These are adorable. I ordered these for my husband and son to match at my sons 2nd birthday party coming up. They are very good quality ties. They do not feel or look cheaply made at all. I would recommend them. The black and grey look very sharp together. These will go great against black dress shirts. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.,5
440782,"This hat is PERFECT. I own a photo booth rental company so I see a LOT of hats. This one I actually got for myself, not to use as a prop. I honestly couldn't be more happy. I wear it on the job to be more fun and it fits perfect and is supper durable. I'm always tossing it around and flipping it up in the air and it's hit the ground numerous times. It always pops right back into shape. You can see the hat in my profile pic as well.",5
670392,I bought this to send my son off to the deer lease.  I loved it because the neon hood would make him easy to spot but he gets to wear camoflauge like the big boys.  It's fleecy and cozy but a good lightweight fleece.  It was great to layer with his carharts and thermals.  He still chooses to wear it as a good cool day jacket or comfy pants to kick around the house.  He loves it.,5
166413,"I tried more yoga capris than I can count- these are BY FAR the best!!!  They fit well, they are comfortable, and the seams are not giving away due to strenuous workout - which happened on several other brands I tried.  They also wash nicely- no fading or shrinkage.  I bought almost every color/pattern I could find in my size!",5
398622,"Wow I ordeed this shirt from Star Struck and Amazon and it came really
fast.  I love my Everett Aquasox t-shirt it was exactly what I ordered

often.",5
75928,I've been using this band almost every day for jeans and pants and let me tell you... It has saved me a lot of money on expensive maternity clothes. I have been able to extend my wardrobe at a fraction of the cost. I'm about five months along and am hoping it lasts for the remainder of my pregnancy. I got the band in black and have been able to wear it comfortably with pretty much everything. My might buy another one in a different color. It almost looks like your wearing a camisole under your shirt. Def worth it!,5
266962,They were useless. Did not stay put at all. My nipples when erect fit snug in the hole but the clips still fell off. I could not keep them on for more than a few seconds. I managed to have them stay in place with spirit gum but that is a pain to remove and leaves residue on my nipples. Also using an adhesive defeats the purpose of play. I wouldn't buy them again. I'm going to try and return them.,1
696881,"GORGEOUS ring!!!!! I'm so sad I have to return it because it's too small. The description states it's a size 7. NO WAY!! I couldn't get it past my knuckle on my ring finger, which is a straight 7. Very disappointed because it's beautiful!! Looks like great quality, so if you have a size 5-6 finger, this is a must have cocktail ring!!!",5
236329,"I wanted this color and read the reviews and size chart and bought the biggest size, which was still a little snigger than I'd like. But it's a great color and pretty inexpensive. I'm happy with it as I was seeking a cheap shelf bra workout top in this color specifically.",5
795069,"The dress didn't look like it did on the model which was fine, but the fit was not flattering.  I took a pic of me in it to show my friend.  She said I look pregnant.  I am 55, small framed and it way short, I wouldve had to wear leggings.  I found a better fitting one for less and got in 3 colors.",3
223272,The is swimsuit is a piece of garbage. It looks nothing like the picture. More like a extremely cheap knock off!! VeRY very poor quality. Can defiantly tell it was made in China!! The stitching was horrendous!! Lesson learned never EVER. ...  never going to order any type of clothing from amazon again!! Not even worth trying return!! Total scam!!,1
174761,"I'm a 5'6"" female, and buy the men's XS. This is my favorite everyday workout shirt: it is baggy and non-form fitting, which is exactly what I want. Men's and women's shirts have similar measurements, except for length, where men's shirts average 1.5-2 inches longer. This provides more coverage when lifting. These also cost much less than comparable women's shirts. For everyday training, these are more than adequate. I have two and look forward to purchasing more.",4
389023,"Not really pleased with the product. The band wasn't a solid color. The stitching is white. It would have looked better with a silver face. Wanted to return it but the seller negotiated giving me a precentage off instead of me sending it back with shipping costing more than the band. Wasn't my ideal situation but, I appreciate their customer service.",2
140644,"The length was okay. But it gripped by hip area in a very weird way. Seem like girl pants. Plus, the material is not very stylish. I can't describe it very well. The best comparison I can come up with is the material used in old and extremely unstylish suits.",2
860761,"This is a beautiful tee for running and all types of workouts. The fit is flattering and the color is vibrant, just as pictured. The material is stretchy, breathable and of great quality.

233067,"I've had it about a week now and I love it. It's well made, solid, and feels like it will last forever. Literally the only problem I have with it is that it is so light and small, that when I do the ""pat down"" I have a miniature freak out, thinking I lost my wallet somewhere.",5
171732,"Keep in mind, it is a swim shirt so it is expected to fit tight. I got mine to wear under a 7mil wetsuit for cold water diving.  It is perfect.  I am normally a medium and ordered a large and it is perfect.  I am 5'11"" and female, and the length of the shirt is perfect for me.  It lands right below the belly button on me.",4
403664,"I really like this the moment I saw it the firt time. I was still hesitant in buying it at first but ended up buying the yellow one which I really considers a very good choice. I love the color (yellow), the style is great too epecially the belt plus the price when I bought it was really a good deal! Please offer more colors and lower down your price and I'd but them all. Offer free shipping if there're multiple orders. Thanks!",5
431071,"I wanted this ring as I lost my original ring several years ago. I had trouble finding one on Amazon because I needed a half size and mostly their rings come in whole sizes. Am I glad that I found this ring. I love it. It can slide on/off with a little bit of effort, but stays in place otherwise. It looks nice on my finger. I have absolutely no regrets buying it.",5
380873,"I've only tried them on so I'll update this review after a few uses.
They were comfortable and covered well, easy to apply and remove. My only complaint is I wish the carrier was a little bigger with the plastics on the inside instead of having to haggle a thin piece of plastic wrap onto the daisies.",4
853123,"Really disappointed, the shoes in general like shoes looks good, but i purchased it for leds lights, and when my daughter started to use it, at the next day the leds began to fail and in a one week just one shoe was turning leds on. Bad design, bad led light implementation. don't purchase it.",1
730056,So I just received the gray one with the white blue and orange stripped sleeve's and it fit so Awesome but if u buy this amazing sweater I highly recommend buying one size up from your normal size and it will fit perfectly not tight or loose but again I love it I'm also waiting for the black one definitely a great product thank you Amazon love it!,5
429236,"My daughter stole the show with this gown.  Had to get a size smaller because it laces up the back, so that made her feel even better in the dress!  This dress is amazing in the Yellow!

The zipper is a bit stiff, so use care zipping and unzipping, or you'll snag and rip the material. Very happy with overall look.",4
639601,"Was hesitant buying because my bust usually was too big from this particular seller (I'm 125lbs, C cup), got a medium. It's adorable, durable in a washing machine, and looks absolutely cute and very soft. Smells a bit odd first, but don't be afraid to wash it, it kept it's shape and is VERY comfortable.",5
74597,"These were perfect for Halloween. They fit well as far as them not being too tight, but they do seem to run a little short, so I wouldn't wear these with a skirt unless you are putting some type of shape wear or undergarment OVER them. My two friends and I all wore these with our coordinating costumes, and we are all different heights (5'4, 5'7, and 5'11)  and body types, but we all had the same issue of them running short. But once we got our undergarments/shorts over them they were fine the whole time we wore them.",5

Thanks for a great product, Marino!",5
329789,I get compliments everywhere I go. I originally fell in love with the Dior sunnies but those are $500. Who has that much money to spend on sunglasses? Aldo carries a version of these but they looked weird. These were perfect for me and I am in love everytime I wear them.,5
170305,"I returned this item because it was much smaller than expected. The fabric also had a very cheap ""synthetic"" look. It was so small I could barely get it on (I'm usually between M and L for tops). It was very itchy and uncomfortable. It was also much shorter than it appears to be in the picture.

Overall, happy with my buy.",4

677897,"I bought this sweater because it looked super cool. When it arrived, it was exactly how people described, smaller than you'd expect. I thought buying a larger size would help, but it was still a bit too tight  for my liking. I'll have to lose all of the ""holiday"" weight I've gained to fit in this comfortably haha. Putting aside the small size, the material and build quality is very nice, especially for the price. I received the product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.",4

I was finally refunded all my money back and a dress I originally ordered and it's actually still too big but fits much better to be altered.",1
794581,Big mistake. Returning it as soon as possible. Size small measurements would fit so I ordered the medium for a little extra room. I could hardly get the thing on and then struggled to get it off. Not a good thing!! Also the fabric had faded patches on the from and back; that was not in the description. Not happy with this product at all!!!,1

It is perfect for me and spouse, everything we have needed fits in the bag which is way better looking in person than is shown online, and attaches to sissy bar on bike with no problems.

If I wash my hands with the watch on, it fills up with water droplets and I can't read the time for about 24 hours. Not sure if there is something wrong with the seal on my particular watch or whether the other reviewers are just more dainty when washing their hands, but it is pretty useless as a watch for me.",2
656856,"Though the material is thin and a bit see through, it fit perfectly. I ordered this, knowing it might be a thin material. The green in reality is slightly lighter, just slightly. It's also a bit difficult to put it on, seeing as it only has a little button and hole, but it was ok.",4

This dress fit really oddly, it wasn't sewn well at all (the different colors are sewn together) and the bottom kind of curls under.  Contacted the seller, but they persuaded me not to return the item (as it would be too difficult and I wouldn't get much back).",1

It does not even seen as large as a XL that I could purchase locally. I went on line to purchase because it is almost impossible to fit my oversize head. This hat fits my wife so we keep it rather than return it.",1
448021,I have a small fame. This jacket fits me perfectly. I would only recommend for petite women.. The quality is amazing. My only complaint is that I received the wrong buckle strap. I received a straight buckle strap instead  of the chic one as described. If I had the right strap I would give it a five star.,4
4149,"The dress only fit as expected because I read previous reviews. I ordered a size large and it fit great! I'm 5'9"" and about 160 lbs. The dress was a perfect length, not too short. It was really cute and I would highly recommend it for someone looking for a 20s dress",4

The material is thin and it needs a slip, but it's nice for summer.  Otherwise, the pattern is cute and it's got a cute cut.  Not my favorite dress, but definitely worth putting in the rotation (and losing 10 pounds so it fits a little more comfortably).",3

Then I get extra material bunching a little at the top of the leg.  The material is textured like tights, so they are not as soft as normal leggings.  The charcoal color is almost black.  I am returning these due to the scratchy texture.  They are also warmer than standard unlined spring/fall leggings and they are dark winter colors.",2

It cost as much to send it back as the dress cost so I decided to keep it and maybe I can find someone to give it to.
If buying from this company allow at least two sizes to make sure it first.
I don not plan on getting anything else from them.

The dress itself is nice just the sizing is wrong.",1

So I found 24mo Carter onesies here and bought them.  The gerber ones feel like an old tshirt cotton, and the carters are really soft and and feel silky.  They work great and I love the layer of onesie to hold the diaper up and add a layer of comfort/warmth.",5

I would have sent ti back but I need this bag as the bag I was replacing had already fallen apart just before this one arrived.  Also, the last time I had an item replaced, it took amazon nearly 6 weeks to pick up the broken item.

864965,I am a overweight at 5-7 and 195. I bought the largest size based on the size chart--7XL or something.  I needed an emergency bathing suit for a beach trip and I didn't want to spend a fortune. This suit is super inexpensive and as well made as any suit I have purchased in a retail store costing 3 times more. Nice fabric. Colors are pretty. I could wear shorts underneath while bike riding and it looks like a top. The boy cut bottom part is a little weird but not really seen so it didn't bother me.,5
667372,arrived over two weeks early and the quality of the design is great. You never know when you have them print a picture on a huge canvas but this turned out great! We use it as a bedroom curtain instead of a shower curtain. The lightweight material works great and the price is better than any actual bedroom curtains out there. Not to mention you can't find Once Upon A Time themed curtains for rooms.,5

The material is cheap, especially the white stripes. I was prepared for it knowing a dress sold at $13 with free shipping from China. But it is quite stylish and fits me well. The design of sleeve on actual dress is different from the picture, obviously a copy with defectives.",3

It wasn't even worth giving away either.",1

My son is really long and skinny so most sleepers are either really baggy around his body and fit his legs or really tight length wise and loose everywhere else. These fit him great.

And now that my infant is older, he loves staring at the patterns. Win for everyone.",5
288000,"Super thin, but that's really how they are supposed to be. Colors look like in the picture, so no issue there. Only reason for 4 stars is that the sleeves actually have little poofs on them that (because they are thin) aren't terribly noticeable, but I would rather they were just normal sleeves like in the photo.",4
639310,"This was tight, very fitted, and short on me, and I found it uncomfortable. I ended up getting rid of it and just buying an XXL non-maternity slip that was loose enough to be comfortable. If you are getting this to go under a short, tight, sheer dress, this might be the best option, but this isn't a great everyday slip.",2
401080,"I'm giving this five stars because it's lovely, and exactly as described - it works on a simple chain for a sparkly accent, on a ball chain to dress up jeans, or on a bracelet. It's about a half inch in diameter - not overwhelming, but sure to be noticed.",5
598029,"This was to be for my wife, and we read everything that Roamans said about this dress. However, their size 20 is much bigger than most 20's my wife has purchased in the past. In the picture that accompanied the write-up, the front hem comes to mid-shin and the sleeve to mid-forearm. Their size 20 was so big that the front hem bagged to the ankles, and the shoulders so broad that the sleeves came down almost to her wrists. While the return was easy, my wife was quite disappointed that something she was looking forward to just failed.",2

Mission accomplished. He loves it! While it is a little large on me, it fits him just right, but that's what I would expect from a one size fits all robe.",4
134738,I absolutely love these socks! Not only are they adorable they are so comfortable on my feet as well. They are knee high so keep that in mind when purchasing because the picture doesn't really show how tall they are. The design is high quality and no cheap or silly looking. I love how these look and feel!,5
859911,"Cute bag, I've gotten tons of complements. It's made out of a canvas material so the black picks up dirt pretty easily but it's easy to just wipe that off. Seems to be pretty sturdy in the stitching around the handles. It holds my 14"" laptop plus a single subject notebook and a few pens with more room left over.",4
486818,"I really like these tank tops! They are cute (I love the lace trim!),  affordable and go with pretty much everything! I love the selection of colors, and they also shipped pretty quickly! As for the one size,  I would say it can fit anyone whose an extra small,  small to medium at most.  It fit me great and I am about a size small un U.S. sizing. I am 5'3,  34b chest, and 27 waist.",4
135238,"This is my favorite brand because they're so cheap. I got these in 20 because my last pair of 18 ran small. These are on the looser side for this brand. I'll wash in hot water/dryer to hopefully shrink them.
The only thing that sucks is most of the Wallflower listings don't specify the inseam, so it's a bit of a gamble. These ones were 35. Very long, but I'm tall, so I'll deal with it. Wish they'd make 33.5 :)",5
153866,"Excellent. The wallet holds its shape very well even without cards in it, and retains the cards very well even with only one or two in each slot. Completely fits into the back pocket of every pair of pants I own. The large main pocket is perfect for receipts, notes, and large bills, while the smaller half-depth pocket that sits inside it is great for american money. And best of all, the wallet can flex along it's closed length, preventing discomfort when sitting on it. Best wallet I've ever owned.",5

I read reviews and decided to order one size up. The grey fit perfect! The Burgandy is a little large, probably could have ordered my normal size. Haven't tried on the blue yet but after the other two I'm not worried about it.
the burgandy has some grey/sheen to it that I'm not fond of but other people seem to think that its cute so I can get over it.
the grey are def my favorite!",5

I am 5""4', 135, 30 C, and pear shaped. The dress ends just below my knees but does not look frumpy. The neck  line is ample, no need for a tank top. Very happy with this purchase.",5

The actor had to dance, so instead of relying on the cord that came with them, I used double-stick tape to attach them to a plastic headband. Worked like a charm and looked great!

I have a smaller torso so it fits but is a little tighter around the hips/stomach.",3

425904,"Really pleased with the quality of this bracelet. I've owned a lot of hemp bracelets and I have to say this is one of the best I've come across, especially given the price. The combination of hemp and leather braided together makes for a super strong bracelet- good if you're as rough on yours as I am on mine. Also, I was pleased to find upon receiving my bracelet that the colors were as bold and vibrant in person as they were in the picture. Like I said, I'm very happy with this buy and would definitely recommend it.",5
13447,The Powerstep line of insoles is top notch. One has to understand what type of issues they are having with their feet so they can choose which product to buy. I have mild pronation and ordered these Orthotics-U Blue and they have corrected the metatarsal pain issues in my feet very well. I started out with the basic style years ago and liked their solid construction and feel. They were to correct plantar pain and did the job. Never had to replace them in many many years.,5

I'd buy it again if i needed to.",4

675999,"In general I really like the ladies Leveret pajamas. However, I find that the options with designs (as opposed to plain or striped) are stiff. The printing of the design is just on the top, and I believe that it's the process and materials used in making the design don't allow the material to soften, even with repeated washing. It's sort of like a printed T-shirt where the design feels like a shield on your chest.

I like the style, and will continue to buy plain or striped versions of these pajamas.",3
549600,"I wouldn't really recommend this product: the photo makes it look a lot nicer than it actually is in person. The actual cape is REALLY oversized and not in a flattering way. The materials feel cheap and the fur trim is faux fur and doesn't look anything like it does in the photo. The item comes from China and easily represents this with the quality... Wouldn't recommend spending over $10 on this. The sender marked the value at $4, which sounds about right.",2
443248,It is ok and the material is beautiful and very soft.  In the picture it seems like there is a thick band around the whole mid section. I don't like the skinny elastic band that goes across my stomach. I tried it with a belt but it rides up. I even tried to make it as a shirt. Unfortunately it did not work. I am only 5 feet and it looked funny on me. Not sure what to do with this dress because it is so pretty.,2

They are comfortable, not stiff like some flip flops start out. I appreciate how the straps are very solidly secured to the shoe. I have to wear these on a wet college dorm bathroom floor, and it's nice not to have the water leaking through the strap holes.",3

By the end of the day when I took them off my big toes felt bruised for being in the position all day.

Not a bad sock just not the right size",3

Not sure of the actual gold quality, but not expecting them to be at level of the ones onjline costing 4 or more times more, but do look as good as those at the local stores at that price.

(A little blow to the self esteem since I typically wear an XL) I think I could have gotten away with a 3X because of the stretchy material, but this size fits okay, just a little loose. It's super cute, and I've gotten many compliments on it. My only complaint is that there isn't a hole or anything for the belt, so it comes loose and doesn't allow you to cinch in an hourglass shape. Nothing a hidden safety pin can't fix, though!",4

It was so short, had I bent over, you could see my unmentionables. It came to the upper part of my thighs. There is also a split in the back. I considered having it sewn closed to see if it would help, but the dress is made funny in the back and it would not have looked right. So, no choice but to send back.",1

You definitely get more than what you pay for considering how low the price is. I think I'll end up buying another one for myself.",5

It isn't worth it to send the dress all the way back to China, so I'll find some pink or blue trim at a fabric store to add some of the length that I wanted.

Quality: the stitching seems good and the fabric (neoprene) is great.

I pulled at the feathers to test the durability and none ripped or  pulled loose. I am happy surprised at how well made the skirt is... I bought this for a Halloween costume and it's super nice.,5
727193,"Good quality construction but sized larger than expected, and getting even more loose with use. I'd advise buyers to get one that might seem a little bit snug but you can count on it stretching a bit with use and eventually fitting perfectly. Materials are very good, as is the construction.",4
683844,"The color is very bright n pretty. The size doesn't just run small, but double small. If you are small I would order large. All my stretch pants are xl but lost some weight so thought large, no way. Says 27.6-37.8. It will not stretch even 5 inches. Also the color is not the same. Shows waist band lighter like gray but it's black. My waist is not 37.8. It's more like 36. Also hand wash only, no dryer, can't hang to dry either,  looks like they will snag really easy also.",2
104472,"I love this swim skirt.  Just what I wanted to insure a little modesty at the pool.  The size was fine, maybe just a ""teeny"" bit large for a 14, but certainly not enough to return it.  I am so happy that I found this...been wanting one for a long time.",5
429175,The hat fits well and is adjustable.  This is the type of hat that won't completly ruin your hairdo.  I would say if you have a very small head don't buy this hat the velcro is more suited for making the hat larger. I plan to put one of the iron on monograms and give it as a present.,4
636506,"This is truly THE smallest 3x I've ever seen!  Luckily, I'm an expert seamstress and I was able to quickly resize the garment, both for me & the one I ordered for my daughter.  Otherwise, it's a super cute shirt...great graphics , nice cotton fabrication & well executed.  Just be aware the sizing is smalllllll....",3
401587,"I bought this product about a month ago. The price of the product was really cheap ($3.50 with no shipping fee), but it does not last very long! Two weeks after I put them on my shoes, the grip decided not to stick to my shoes. However, I must say before the glue of the grip went out, it did prevent my shoes slip out of my feet.",3
54034,"Bought this for my 5mo, and I love it.  It's very soft and light. And provides lots of shade for his head,neck, and shoulders.  I bought 6-18 mo since my kids usually run large in the craniums- and this is a good fit.  The hat has a toggle adjustment to keep it  fitting well.  Great product!",5
212397,"A very classy and comfortable glove that is not so thick that you lose your dexterity, yet is suitable for light winter conditions. The glove is very soft and very well made with good attention to details. I wear this with a motorcycle jacket, but it would be equally suitable for formal wear. I am not someone who like gloves, but I needed a glove for winter that looked somewhat formal. This glove exceeded my expectations. It is very comfortable and fairly warm.",5
852768,"While these are very cute, they absolutely do not fit sizes 7-16. They are very small. I ordered them for my little girl, who usually wears a size 12 jean and they were unusable, we gave them to the little girl next door.

Do not buy them if you child is bigger than around a size 10, and then don't expect them to fit for long.

If your child is under a size 10 this is probably a good deal. You should probably buy the bigger size if your child is in the larger little kid sizes too.",1
425160,"These briefs for men are pretty good quality. I was impressed with the heavy duty feeling fabric. I'm sure they'll hold up well after several washes. Nice and soft waistband. My only gripe would be the sizing. For me they are just a little big. It's not extremely noticeable, but these briefs seem like they were designed for body builders or just big beefy guys. If you're slim to average in build, you might to size down or just pay particular to the manufacturers sizing guidelines. The price was right, and I would buy again.",4
662888,"So adorable! My grand child loves this product. She has one on each glove and attached to her Jacket so she don't lose them. They just clipped to her sleeve and grabbed her little mittens tight. They are pink her favorite color. Now we won't lose her winter ware and we will know at all times where they are. They stretch too! They are a five star rating for sure. Love it! They come in other colors too! My grand son needs some too!
 I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review.",5
754511,"This is a lightweight jacket, not heavy enough to be called a coat. It is too small in the shoulders and arms, even when ordering the larger size. I also had a terrible time getting a refund for the item. It took over a week & a lot of emails to finally get a refund. I was very unsatisfied!",1
787869,"I ordered a size small hoping to use it as a ""going out"" winter shirt, but it was definitely a bit bigger than I anticipated. I am 5'4"" and about 115lbs.
It is very soft material. Goes great with a pair of leggings and boots, but that's about it. The midnight blue is a gorgeous color.",4
69073,"Based on other's reviews, I ordered 1 size larger and they are perfect. Nice pink color as expected. My granddaughter was not able to take them off like she does her other shoes. This was nice since we were at the beach for a week. Great price and great shoes.",5
854810,"Excellent quality, still not exact movie specs but you'd have to be a stickler for details(like myself) to notice any discrepancies. But for the price is expect an absolutely flawless copy. However it's still undeniably the best on the market! For those with a head size right on the cusp of 59-61"" it will feel extremely tight at 1st, use a hair dryer technique to ""stretch"" it to a more comfortable fit. & a little elastic sewed to the stationary side of the chin strap worked great for me.",5
298863,"It was a little large for me being that I am a petite woman. I am 5'4"" and normally a size 2. The skirt went down to mid-calf and was a little poofy at first. However, it was made of nice material and the width went down after it was out of the packaging a little while. For the price, this item is well worth it.",4
481289,I ordered 7 of these. They where not the same exact pendant as pictured in their photo. I opened the first one only to have it fall apart after 4 snaps - in an hour.  After examining the other 6 I noticed a few more had already fallen apart in their package. I will be returning these.,1
463643,"Very disappointed. I have a small 8 year old with what,  compared to others is a pretty small head,  and the hat just keeps popping off.  He has to press it down hard to get it on,  and if he bends at all, it pops off because the elastic inside doesn't grip his head.  Would love to return,  but too much trouble and not worth it for the 28 bucks I paid.",2
820869,"I love the set! The pants fit great and they are soft and breathable! I love that they are truly high waisted, a lot of people decribe yoga pants as high waisted and they're not. I have a big behind and these fit great. I also am very busty and the bra is a little tight but wearable. All and all the quality is great and I really like this set for yoga and running. I recieved this product at a discount for my honest review.",5
723037,This product was WAY Too small!!! i used their measurement chart and this dress was at least 2 sizes too small on me.. now i go to return and they have a policy that i could only return it before 30 days. Im an International costumer and i had to wait for someone from the Us to take it back so that UPS can pick it up at their home.. VERY disappointing over all!!,1
268159,Was looking for a new iPhone wallet but wanted something a little more substantial and this really fit the bill. Got it just before a vacation across the country and I really love the convenience of it holds everything I need on daily excursions. Very nice leather. I really couldn't be more happy with it.,5
233070,"Perfect wallet for minimalist.  I carry 2-3 credit cards, driver's license and gym card, along with a $20, $10, $5 and a few $1s folded over.  Very well made and elastic material and strap are great.  This replaced a leather bi-fold wallet I've been using for decades.  I always hated carrying a thick wallet in my pant pocket.  This wallet is thin enough to put in front or rear pant pocket or shirt pocket and I hardly know it's there.  I also sometimes clip it to my keys.  Super great product!",5
734114,"The ears on the hat are not cat ears, they are very round like teddy bear ears. They are also in a strange placement. Product does not look at all the same as the photos. The only thing that kept me from giving it 1 star is that the material seems well made.",2
755596,"Loved the luggage on our first trip in 2016.  Haven't used it since, however upon arrival at the airport the smallest piece extended handle broke and I was unable to use it.  This was a huge inconvenience since this is the piece that is a carry on.  I would love for the company to replace the handle if possible.  I am leaving again in 2 weeks and need this piece to be usable.",2
847889,"I ordered a Men's Medium because I like my tees a bit large; this one obviously runs smaller like a size junior. It fits normal in the shoulders but is smaller through the mid-section. Would fit someone with a tall, thin build quite well because it is also about one or two inches longer than an average tee shirt. I am getting a lot of compliments on the green color that I chose.",4
178283,"1. Wrong color. Burgundy was red.
2. Cardboard material with fabric over it. You CANNOT iron this.
3. I have a very small head and it still could not fit.
4. This hat does not look like the image. It looks like something I could have done myself. Horrible. I waited over two weeks just to send it back.
The seller however was very nice. They expedited the shipping for me since it could have taken 2 months. Nevertheless I have to send it right back. Thank God for amazons return policy.
I'll just get a hat somewhere else.",1
464762,"Cute costume but when I took it out of the packaging there were several loose strings coming out all over it. To me, that just means it will be quick to fall apart. Hopefully my step daughter will be able to get through at least one night of trick or treating before that happens. She also told me the sleeves are super itchy.",3
694342,"I should have ordered my regular size, but I ordered one size up. Still not too big, just a little bit. The bust was large, and it's a longer shirt. The waist is not tight. The quality is good though.
My only issue is that the description says machine wash cold, but when the shirt came the tag says dry clean only. It's made of 95% polyester and 5% spandex.",4
573239,"My grandson wanted pajamas with a button-down front for his birthday. When I looked in the stores, I couldn't find any in his size (5), so I turned to Amazon. He still loves Thomas the Train, so these pajamas were perfect. They were a big hit!. And the material was soft to the touch and warm for the winter weather. I couldn't have asked for anything better!",5
170854,"Worst purchase I have made. Not only did it come late, but I ordered a Large and got an XXXL. It was weak on one side which means it was pointless to wear, strings hung everywhere from it and got caught in the hooks and it is NOT steele boned. It is plastic. I literally bought garbage and I am furious. I hate you people.",1
233335,"I love these beanies! They are warm and sooo soft, not itchy at all.  I like that you can wear it pulled down over your ears or slouchy. I like them so much that I ordered two more. I have ivory and beige and I am waiting for black and burgundy.

186522,"I'm 5'8"" pear shaped ~135lbs and ordered a size medium. If you're looking for a tight cinch go a size smaller, it fit me like a glove(and looks great) but I couldn't take it any tighter to really exaggerate my waist line. The overall quality is surprisingly nice for the price.",4
178225,This is an excellent bathing suit. The only problem is the size. It would be good to order 1 or 2 sizes bigger. I ordered an XL and it fits like a medium. Its good quality and well made. The bra has a lot of padding like a push up bra. Overall awesome piece to my collection.,4
413392,"I was initially scared to purchase these since they hadn't been reviewed much but I'm glad I did. They are beautiful! Not only is the quality great but they arrived in a nice little box with a product guarantee certificate from the company. I would definitely consider buying from this company again.

You can't beat the price!",5
119288,It has very good material and i like it i could definietly see myself wearing this for halloween. It is shipped all the way from hong kong and  it took about 4 weeks to come in. The only thing i didn't like was how hard the hairband was behind my ears. Overall its a good product,4
258976,So glad to have this cute little swim diapers. So much better than having to purchase paper swim diapers and they seem far more comfortable. I like the printed bottom better than the white. The white just seems like it could stain more easily. These are great to have on hand for playing in the backyard on a summer day as well.,5
49535,I bought a LG initially and have ordered a M now - I really am a fan of these! Received on time and as expected. I would recommend. I will mention that they do bend toward the top and bottom but I don't think they'd be as comfortable if they didn't.,5
319368,"This is not a Genie Bra.  It is a counterfeit.  I own several of the real product and everything was off about these.  The material is cheap and thin, the sizing is off and the band that lays under the breast was even the wrong width.  I was very disappointed with this purchase.  Contacted the seller in China and he claimed he was going to refund my money, which never happened.",1
878678,"The bottoms fit ok. But the top was awful!!! I have really big boobs, so I figured I would need to fix it. But this was awful!!! I'm going to have to take it completely apart and redesign it. I guess that's what I get for buying it online. ",1
551488,"These really are amazing. I had a nice pair of emerald earrings that I was nervous to wear because the earring backs that came with the pair were too dainty. As soon as I put these on I could feel the difference (and hear them click into place!) It is very reassuring and I highly recommend them. I wish they were cheaper, but I am going to use this pair of earring backs with all of my earrings so I will certainly get my money's worth!",5

280151,"I'm not a huge fan of these shoes.  The back strap digs into my ankle something fierce, rubbing off the skin - and it continues to regardless of how loose I try to make it.  The straps across the top of the foot are kind of wide and loose, so my foot tends to slide off of the arch support. (Even after I tighten the straps.)  Also I haven't worn them all that much, and I can already see where the stitching is coming undone.  So much potential - but I'm just not wearing these shoes.",2
359116,Loved everything about the wrap. Looked as I expected when it arrived. Material is nice since I didn't want a see thru sarong. Only thing I can mention as a negative is that the coloring on the inside of the sarong is not as bright as the outside. It is much more dull. Overall very happy with the product. I like the bright colors!,4
290898,Looks just like the picture and runs big.. I love how it looks on me but the material is HORRIBLE! Type of material that as soon as you start moving it stretches out and stays like that.. I'm 5'1 155pounds and I got a small.. I'm very curvy and still had to get someone to make it tighter . It looks great but so cheap I don't know if I could ever wear it anymore,2
699641,Bought the wallet as a gift for my husband. He had his prior wallet for years but it was looking rough. He was reluctant at first to part with old wallet but 3 months later he loves this wallet. Perfect amount of card holders  & he likes the divider. He keeps cash on one side & business receipts on the other side.,5
715349,"Package arrived on time from Amazon. This dress is a must have if u want to look sexy!!  The sheer mesh on the front and back shows enough skin without having to wear a bra, although a lace bra would look good.  The dress Is well made and for the price well worth it!",4
70384,Read every review and nervously ordered a women's size 4.5 X (med) for my daughter who wears a 1.5 children's street shoe. They came in today and fit perfectly with a little room to grow. As soon as she put them on she said she never ever wanted to wear any other brand. She said they were very comfortable!,5
213631,This 3 pack was a great deal! My daughter gets so many compliments on her hats. Love the dark blue! They fit from about 6 months up unless you have a baby with a high head circumference.  My daughter has been wearing them for about 2 months and just the pink one is snug. However- she spit up on that one and it got washed. I would recommend hand washing or setting on something to stretch out the hat as it dries to keep it from shrinking. Overall I would purchase again and recommend.,5
438749,"If you look at the one that Warner Bros has, you would not like the price, let alone how much detail is in it. This has excruciating detail down to the logo. The chain is spectacular and the logo itself is really neat. The price isn't all that bad either. If you're truly into the Green Lantern, get this one instead of the one from Warner Brothers. You'll see the difference",5

Its not meant to be form fitting, its meant to be an oversized sweater and it is exactly that. Its super soft and I'm so happy with my purchase.

Advice: buy it if you are looking for the perfect oversized long sweater. If you are on the fence BUY IT, the seller offer free returns.",5
496531,"Usually when I order something like this, it is ALWAYS too small. But I took a chance and it fits great. Nice and stretchy, and above all SHINY!  My only complaint is that the waistband is not tacked sufficiently, so that the elastic inside twists around. Easily fixed with a few minutes with a needle and thread, or a few safety pins as a temp fix.",5

If you are short it may just work for you.",3

But the large fit just fine even though they look very tiny in the package.  Really glad we tried them on (over a diaper for sanitary reasons) before returning.",5
516113,"Super cute, love the little owl. Worth the price. Don't buy if you don't the the fact that the owl doesn't stay facing in one direction. In other words, it doesn't have an extra ring to dangle from so it hangs from the chain itself, causing it it face sideways when you hang it midair. Its not biggy, just keep it in mind and flip it if its backwards.",5
402759,I should have read the reviews before ordering.  The shape is nothing like what's shown in the picture.  No flip curl at the bottom.  Bangs are centered and doesn't extend from one side to the next.  The top is not rounded as shown but more of a rectangle going down the center from front to back instead of a bouffant look.  I'll have to work with it a lot to try and shape it properly.,1

814515,"the design is really nice, but the sew quality is terrible (loose threads all over, some stitching not symmetrical).  The sizing is odd since the sleeves and chest fit fine, but the waist tapers outward (not inward like slim fit items usually do), so the shirt ends up looking over-sized.  A bit of tailoring will likely be needed, so be prepared.",2
752219,"It does the job, mainly bought becasue my keys were tearing holes in my pocket.  This solves that problem.  It did take over a month to come though.  Turns out that it came directly from China.  Surprisingly well belt, especially considering that it did come from China.  I'm very satisfies with it.",4

96078,"This dress is a fantastic bargain. It fits an hourglass figure. I'm 5'9"" and 180 lbs and pear shaped (usually wear size 12), and the XL fit me perfectly. I hand washed it before wearing and the navy jersey bled a lot, plus the white piping shrank and tugged a little, but the dress was a steal and I'll wear the heck out of it for a few years. The white bow just under the breast was too big and floppy; I simply tied it in another knot and now it looks tidy.",5
687761,"Really really gorgeous dress, but the fabric just feels like something youd wear to a bbq, and i ordered this for prom lol. But the way it flows and sits on your body makes up for that and you cant even tell. Also its a little big around the waist line, but with all the tying it gets tighter!",4
44940,"Its a little loose on our baby right now but that's because she is a preemie and is a size of a 4 month old.  Next winter this hat will fit even better.  Soft and comfy and baby likes it a lot more than regular hats with scratchy velcros.  Great product, definately worth the money.",5
647615,"Very pretty but even the small was too large. I would have loved an extra small but that wasn't a size option. Fabric great, but sleeves a little too long even for 3/4 sleeve length. I am 5' tall, 105lbs, but I have a large chest. Thank goodness the whole thing is adjustable, but wasn't happy with how it hung on my chest. Hence I sent it back, even though I loved the color and print",3
200867,"These are very simple bow headbands. Nothing fancy but are still cute. The do tend to slip because there isn't rubber or anything in there to prevent it, but you get what you pay for. my 11-month old did rip off one of the bows, it looks like it's either lightly glued on or has a single stitch because it came off very easily. But I still have several other colors and they are good for the price.",4
741048,This hat is adorable! I bought it for my soon to be grandchild so have not tried it on anyone yet but I think it will fit a 6 month to 1 year old baby.  It looks pretty small and does not fit my 5 year old grandson. The hat is well made and I'm very happy I bought it.,5
335745,"I was very pleased with the delivery time. My earrings arrived way ahead of the expected arrival time. However,  the earrings did not look like the ones in the picture nor did they fit the way they do on the model in the picture.  They look much larger. I had a difficult time keeping them in my ears. I had to really squeeze and press them in my ear. They would fall down and just dangle in my ears.",2
827071,"Beautiful, beautiful awesome scarf. I do have a similar scarf with blue color which I paid much higher price, but this scarf with this low price, you don't need to think about whether or not I hit the purchase button. You must have this. I do like the shiny part of the scarf which was the main reason I bought. It looks awesome.",5
570182,"My favorite winter hats . I purchased mauve this time and a blue one last winter. Sure wish I would of known I would love it so much! This year there were only 2 colors left, mauve & brown. It's super cute and I get a lot of compliments on it. I have long hair and love the fact I can put all my hair in or leave it out.",5
398066,"I have had one for about a year now. It works great for what it is. The moving dial is a time keeper. This does work underwater, I have used mine in the pool many many times. even the hottub. keeps wonderful time. This watch works great, and looks great.",4
368659,"Love the fit! Perfect and easy to throw on in a hurry, quiet comfortable. 5'6"" 160lbs, got a large and it's very flattering, doesn't hug too tight. Looks great with nude or black pumps and you don't need to worry about jewelry b/c it looks great without much else added.",5
293088,"These are great bras. They run small in the bust. I'm a 34 and I should have gotten a 36. I have a bra extender though so it's fine. The pads are super thick and rigid but removable.  when hubby and I go on a date, I like to wear the bra with the padding and a tight sweater. ;)",5
456571,"I am so disappointed!  I love white cotton nightgowns, have bought many over the years.  This ""Betty"" is cut tight in the arms and across the back.  I have always bought large or xlarge (roomy), but this xlarge is skimpy, and because it is tight under the arms and arms, it doesn't hang right and is very uncomfortable.  I will return it and try one of the other styles...hopefully they will be cut as other companies cut the nighties.",1
664385,"I am 5'9, wear a 16 and bought an extra large. The dress goes  down to my knees.  I got the flower/bird pattern.  There is a little bleading of ink on the design, hardly noticeable.  The material is good quality.  You will probably want to use a belt because of the seam on the stomach.",4
367974,"I love this bag! Usually I only buy name brand but I liked the design and the blue went great when out with jeans. it's amazing how many women stop me and tell me they love this bag, even more than my name brand ones. I bought blue and silver my mother was driving me crazy all the time telling me she loved my bag so I gave her the silver one she loves it.",4
242924,"I want to start out by saying this is a GREAT ring. I've had it for over a week now and it's still just as shiny as the day I got it, and there are no scratches on it.

For me, this ring runs half a size too large. I'm going to have yo return my size 8 ring for a size 7.5 because it slides off my knuckle far too easily. I've always worn an 8, but this ring is just a touch too big at that size.",5
144609,"I love the variety of colors, and the sizes. I don't like flashy or heavy earrings, so these are ideal for me. The earring backs are a bit difficult to remove, but I don't mind it too much because that means they won't get lost as easily as other stud earrings I've owned. I might get something similar to these in a bit of a larger size too.",4
1486,"This watch box is almost too classy to be so functional.  It's not storage, it's presentation.  Beautiful.  This was a gift for my boyfriend and instead of keeping it in the armoire where he used to put his jewelry, he keeps it out.  It's too nice to be hidden.  Nothing bad to say about it.",5
583494,"Quality was very bad. It looked nothing like how the picture had promised. The top was too big and the bottoms were too small. I Probably just got a bad one from the pile since some people seem to really like this product. Overall, i would not recommend this swim set.",1

I wore my for my first homecoming . And the shoes I have in the picture , I also got on Amazon and all together it looked amazing .",5
524249,"This product is so beneath Fruit of the Loom.  The material doesn't stand up to even one washing.  The nylon unraveled and twisted itself around my other delicates in the handwash mode.  This happened, not once, not twice, but 3 times so half of the panties are in the garbage.  Would not recommend this purchase.  Didn't go all the way to 1 star since the panties fit great.  I'm just not into handwashing, nor am I into the unbreathable fabric nylon.",2
67687,"Was looking for a decent sized beach bag. It was foolish of me to not check the measurements! This so called ""large"" bag recommended for the beach was actually very small.  I would hate to see what they consider a ""small"" bag...maybe room enough for a bottle of sunscreen!!",3
352981,"Awesome quality leather! My husband works in oil refinery's on his feet, 12 hour days, up and down ladders so he has to keep his boots tied tight and these laces have been great! He wore through the ones that came with his boots and these fit his 8 inch lace up thorogood moc toe boots with a bit to spare! Its been 3 months and no sign of wear, thanks! I do recommend these and I'm sure ill be back when he eventually wears these out!",5

I was a little disappointed to see that the suit was actually a little small and the top didn't offer the best support. It's a nice made suit, but I will probably end up giving it to my smaller sister.",3
316351,These gloves are great. They work like a charm. I bought them for a friend who took them to Yosemite this winter and she said they worked perfectly for her. Saved her hands from the biting cold while she was on her phone. It's amazing what the little technology-fibers can do. And they are cute and very warm. The insides feel so soft. I definitely recommend these gloves.,4
240590,"I bought a new $800 white gold wedding band to  replace my 30 year old yellow gold band. (Never really liked yellow gold color).  Within a month of wearing it had many scuffs and fine scratches.
I took it to jewler to be buffed and polished.
I read reviews about White Tungsten Carbide scratch resistance and ordered the 5mm 10.5 ring size. It looks great, fits great and I love it!
For daily wearing this is my new ring.  There is price and there is value, this ring has both!",5
383960,"Cute top that is a great color, however, it runs small so I retuned it. The material is nice and lightweight and really soft. It is also really long which I would have loved since I am tall. My gut told me to go two sizes bigger but I didn't and I am really bummed.
I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",4
239386,It's not perfect.. but it is extremely close and for the price... I would have given it 7 stars out of 5 haha. I wear a 4.5 and ordered a 5... it fits great. I was worried about the sizing so I was pleasantly surprised with that. Seriously a stunning ring... perfect if you are on a really tight budget.. or if you need a fake to travel with (why I bought it). Couldn't be more pleased.,5
740106,"It was bigger than I expected, but 100% cotton so I tried to shrink it, which helped a little. The sleeves are too short. It only looks good if I scrunch them up. It's pretty thin too. I guess I was expecting more of a sweatshirt thickness. Overall, I like it enough.",3
783510,This is my third shirt from Joe's USA. Every shirt I bought from them fits perfectly. No worries about the shirt shrinking of fading over time. It also stays in place and doesn't creep up on you like some shirts when your being active. The V neck is just right and it's low enough but it doesn't show off the twins. Make more colors Joe and I'll buy more!,5
384230,Initially I gave 5 stars but then I realized the bow can unscrew from the front and that part is completely stripped. Not sure how it stayed on for the first couple weeks. Now I have to try to fix it or find a replacement. Really disappointed about this as I really liked the look of it.,1
55233,"I purchased this for Halloween.  I ordered my size but it ended up being slightly too big for me.  The top (back side) and belt both hung loose.  The skirt is long!  I am 5'6"" and the skirt was mid-calf on me and felt way too long (not the look I was going for).  The material was nice and overall it is good quality.  I did find a hole in the shoulder seam, but even with that it didn't feel cheap.  If you are tall...this might be a good costume for you!",3
132143,"Would only get if you have a small frame. If you have boobs you' ll be fine. Not made for a thick girl, shirt will ride up.

Very cute, many compliments, worth the price!

Once again you need a slender frame, you don't have to be a toothpick, but you cannot have a belly of any sort for this purchase  ladies.",5
353816,I didn't expect that the headband and ear were not together.  I had to put the ears on the headband which wasn't that easy to do.  It doesn't look as nice as in the picture but they are OK.  For the price there were nicer cat ears out there.,3
691263,"Only thing missing for me, I wish the front pouch was double-lined fabric.  Otherwise, pleasantly surprised with the quality.  Would buy again!  Bought a couple of similar designs from ManView and the cut on this model is much nicer - doesn't bunch around the hips and sits nice n high in the back.",5
723208,"I love how it's really cute, got both the I  Mom & I  Dad onesies for our little boys. We got one up larger & it fit just right. Too much movement though can rip the sewing apart but it can be re fix if you know how to sew it back together.",4
43543,"Unfortunately this umbrella arrived with three small holes in the plastic.  I liked the size (for my 5 year old), but decided to get a refund in stead of a replacement, fearing any others would rip easily.  The plastic was not as strong as I had hoped it would be.",2

LOVE THE COLOR! It's such a bold blue without being too much.the material is a tad thin but that will be just fine come summer time! I'm 5'9"" so sometimes these skirts are shorter on me but this sits just above my ankles so it's not too bad for my style.",5
650832,"I ordered a Large, although I typically wear a Medium in most mass produced clothing. I am 5'8"" and 150#. The arms and legs of these PJs are way too short. The pants hit mid shin and the sleeves hit about four inches above my wrist. I found the rest of the fit fine and the fabric soft, but the cut of these is totally wrong. Disappointing as I could have paid half this much at Old Navy for a much better fit!",1
664985,I like it. Good quality fabric. Knocking one star off because the pic looks teal whereas the t-shirt I received is a lot darker green than teal. But the scoop neck is pictured accurately. So it's pointless buying if you are not comfortable wearing a neckline that deep. It's not shallower than it looks. It's exactly as in the pic.,4
27751,"I have been wearing the original Powerstep inserts for years and they've successfully managed my chronic plantar fasciitis. I recently went on a desperate search for the perfect everyday sneakers, and the best pair I found were woefully lacking in sole cushioning. I found the Pinnacle inserts online and figured it might compensate for the ""walking on plywood"" feeling. They did not disappoint. The moment I put weight on my feet it was like I was walking on a memory foam cloud used as a mattress by God himself. I am pleased.",5
99536,"This bag receives 4.5 stars from me, largely in part to their excellent customer service. I will make every effort to purchase from Scarleton again, quality and customer service are amazing!

I originally purchased this bag in blue but it had a defect which disappointed me.

I alerted the customer service and they sent me a new bag in a brown color which I requested. The quality of the bag was exceptional, beautifully crafted, looked and felt like real leather, the perfect purse, for just a little bit of everything.",4
400943,"Very nice fit for those without a big belly.  I have a hard time finding shirts that don't have excess material sticking out the back when tucked in, but fit well around the chest.  This shirt fits nicely, with very limited material sticking out of the waist band of my trousers when tucked it.  The only trouble is that I can't seem to find a large selection of colors for this great shirt.",5
377458,"Returning due to the top being too small.  I normally wear a 34C bra.  The bottoms were snug, but I also didn't like the extra material in the front making them baggy in the front panel.  Quality material and beautiful suit! Just wish they would redesign the fit.",3
81934,The necklace came within a week or so and it was in great condition for the first week. Then the chain broke. Then after another week the little door that kept the clock enclosed wouldn't shut. It's a really pretty necklace and I like the size but it isn't the best quality.,3
203321,I loved it! Some of the gold accents look a little cheap which is my only reason for the missing star besides the small size. I had worried it would be too small but it is just big enough to hold my stuff. Very happy with my purchase and definitely better than most of what u see at comparable prices. The style of the bag is worth any other downfall. Just a sidenote...it is more metallic in person rather than the subdued silvery white in the picture.,5
555545,"I am so thoroughly impressed. I am 5/10, 175 lbs and was so worried about length. The length, ideal. The fit, sharp. The feel, soft and sleek. I haven't been this pleased with a sight unseen purchase in a very long time. I purchased a size large, and I take a size 10-12 in tops , pants and dresses, depending on designer. Love my purchase!!!!!",5
271624,Love the earring. They are beautiful. But the darn screw back makes it almost impossible to put in my babys ears. Dont get me wrong I wanted screw backs to prevent losing them but they are so hard to put in! Hopefully they will be the same amount of hard to take back out.,4
223259,Ok for the price. Nothing too hot about it. Good for covering up if you don't want to expose too much on the beach. The tie in the front can be tied tighter to prevent a lot of breast exposure. If you require a push up bra for your breast or you have large D size breast this product is not recommended.,2
629944,"Love these socks! I can wear them with my Sketchers Deja Vu Fashion sneakers and you can barely see the sock. I have a few other no show socks but they tend to fall off because they're much more open on the top of the foot, but these cover a little bit more and stay on.",5
386542,"I practically live in my activewear as I take classes or work out at home almost every day, and this has been a great addition to my workout clothes. Its snug without being too tight, and I love the straps in the back; they look fantastic with other cutout tops I wear.

Worn for Pilates, HIIT workouts, aerial yoga and aerial classes.",5
424729,"The pants fit well, so I am going to keep them, but the fabric is really heavy, and there is too much of it, making the legs flop more than flair.  Also, the black is not black enough but more of a grayish-black.  It's difficult for me to find pants that fit well, and these do fit well, but if you're a size that doesn't have to compromise, don't buy these pants.",3
261206,"The blouse itself was fine, but because the way it was cut it does not cut off my shoulders and it does seem like its a Asian style cut. I'm a 38 DD and more broad shoulder. So if you are built like an Asian it will fit you. I believe I saw the same shirt on ebay and it came from China. So the instructions tell me to actually watch because it's built for Asian sizes.",2
25889,These orthopedic inserts are amazing!  They make such a difference.  I had the beginnings of planters fasciitis and the support from these inserts has made such a difference when playing tennis or walking.  I will be ordering a couple additional pairs so I can have a set of inserts for each pair of athletic shoes I own.,5
784147,Item is not what picture show. Picture show to have a belt type material around waste/under breast which it does not come with. I wear a size 14 in jeans and ordered a size 3x in this item which I thought of course would be big.. This item for my 13 year old which wears a size 5/6 in jeans. Was not happy with this item.,2
76309,"This has been a life-saver!  It has allowed me to stay in my regular jeans even to 20 weeks now.  It's very comfortable, and the rubber strip on the inside on the bottom-half keeps it in place.  It just looks like I have a long t-shirt or camisole on underneath my shirts.",5
224010,"Good value for chlorine resistant swimwear. It's not as full (ie less fabric all the way around the gathered elastic waist) which is ok with the top I bought to wear with it. And it's a bit longer than others I've purchased, which is ok if you're a tad bit heavy in the rear.",4
614570,"Top is great. Bottoms are a bit small when it comes to the straps on the sides; those are kinda tight. I have to agree with all the other posts saying I wish we could mix and match. Worth it for the top though. Cheaper than what I could find around here, and a lot cuter.",4
278669,"They were okay, kinda feel cheap but considering the price it wasn't a big deal. My biggest issues  was the deliver method. They were sent in a giant envelope so they were not really protected. The nose pieces were a little bent so they sat crooked on my face. I was able to bend and adjust it better but i cant get them perfectly straight. You get what you pay for.",3
103060,"It looks pretty good on me. I'm 5'6"", size 8/10. Pear shaped. Doesn't really seem to be much ""pushing up"" going on. Also, sometimes the supportive foam cups in the top get turned out of place and you have to manipulate them through the fabric to get them back into the correct position.. Sigh. I haven't tried doing any extensive swimming in it. I definitely wouldn't wear it if you were planning on swimming in the ocean. Probably not good for swimming laps either.",4
435732,"The seller was great, she was able to make our bracelets exactly the way we wanted them. They came exactly the size we asked for. But even if it isn't the right size, there are instructions that come with that tell you how to expand or shrink your bracelet. We love these bracelets!",5
797855,"OMG this are so comfortable. I could walk for miles in these shoes! They are very cute on. I will say that these won't work on slippery surfaces, so if you're looking for snow boot type of shoes, these are not it! The bottoms do have some tread, but they are quite ""smooth"" and won't give you a lot of traction. Now if you're just wanting something super comfy and cute to wear in cold weather, now these are the perfect shoe!",5
747718,"This is absolutely wonderful! It sparkles and it looks classy. My wrist is 6inches and I need to close it to the first chain. So I would assume it fits large wrists as well.

311481,These socks are super cute to have as you become a new mama! They are comfortable and the grippies are functional and safe. I still wear mine around the house all the time. Even bought a pair for my sister who is about to have a baby. They make a fun little present for a mom-to-be.,5
227439,"I was really nervous about the ""one size fits all"" deal but these fit perfect! I'm 5'2"" about 140lbs.

I bought 4 more pairs!!",5

It looks like it's great quality. Time will tell after she wears it for awhile. I'm exited to give it to her. I hope she loves it as much as I do!
If it changes colors or tarnishes I'll come back to update my review.",4

If you're a Call of Duty fan and you're considering purchasing this item, save your money. There's better choices out there than this.",1
812289,Great Belt! Compared with my friends Original Hermese buckles and they look almost indistinguishable. the original Hermes was a little wider and of course has a stamp on the bottom that reads HERMES. The Belt is Reversible and Awesome! in Hindsight if I knew it was reversible I would have ordered the Brown belt as all of the belts have black on the inside. I just placed an order for the Gold Buckle Light Brown Belt! Great Product!,5

I still wear mine but I have had to patch them a couple times.

856928,I really like the quality and fit of this product but the chemical smell is HORRIBLE.  I have washed it 4 times now and I have tried airing it out outside and it still smells so badly of chemicals that I can't put it on my child.  It even caused the other clothes in the wash to smell like chemicals and I had to wash them 3 times to make it smell better.,1

These are the exact same ones that are at the flea market. I attached some photos.

I also purchased this in red and white.",1
464639,"Bracelet is nice, but it is shown in picture as a lot of chain and a few hearts. When worn, the hearts are larger and chunkier than expected, and it gives the bracelet a lot of depth it could do without. Also, silver is much shinier in person than shown - it makes the bracelet look somewhat cheap.

It is usually difficult for me to find a perfect fit in women's size, even in juniors' size, especially for a set. Usually the bottom part comes way bigger than the top; for example I usually need a Small top, but an XS bottom; which is impossible if I want a set (unless I buy 2 sets). But this set is perfect!",5
753040,"Knowing that a lot of times when the chart says it runs small, it does, I ordered a large even though I normally wear a size 8. It fits very well, but it is a major struggle to pull on and off because of how tight it is in the shoulders. Once it's on, it fits like a glove. My advice would be to order one size larger than you would normally wear.",4
782255,"Love these so much! They fit great and extremely comfortable.  I usually am a size 2, and I was worried these would be too big, but they fit fine.  After a day of wearing them they are stretched out a bit, so I just make sure I wash them in between each wearing.",5
768638,"This is a great tee. The tshirt fits as expected. I ordered a size small it is a regular mans tshirt so if you are female consider how a male shirt fits you and go with that.

The image on the front looks amazing everyone stops and asks where have I gotten it from. They completely love it.",5
358751,I love the guava kids mitts. They are super comfortable and they are so easy to put on and take off baby's hands. The straps are the best thing about the mitts that keep the baby from removing the mitts themselves. I would definitely recommend these mitts to any parents needing of mitts for their baby.,5
509632,"I bought this for my 16 month old. And it actually fits her perfectly but she is small, only weighs 21 pounds. So that makes me think that these pajamas run small because I think they would be tight on a ""normal"" 18-24 month old. But they are super cute and really comfortable and washed great with no fading or major shrinking.",5
72819,"I am 5'9"", 125 pounds, I got a medium and it fits great. As you can see I am very skinny and this hoodie shirt fits me slim. I love how you can button up the front part to make a slimmer fit of the hoodie. I like this company and I will still buy from them.",5
651808,"Love this sweatshirt!
I need off the shoulder sweatshirts because I don't like anything tight around my neck, ever.
The picture on-line looks like the neck is just cut-off and has a ragged-edge.  This is NOT the case.  It is hemmed and sewn very nicely all around the neck.  It is very good quality.
The fit is great, just as expected size-wise.  I got an extra large, and that is how it fits me.
I will be ordering more!",5
175178,"I bought this in an extra large, and of course, when it came it was sooo short and small that it would have fit a size small. My little sister is 13 and she fits in it wonderfully. The dress is actually pretty cute, and well made-but the sizes are WAY OFF so unless you are planning to give it your little sister when it comes in the mail and doesn't fit, I wouldn't recommend buying this one without seeing if it covers up your fanny and fits well...",3
505773,"Great fit very trendy look.  I had 3 different friends try them on all with totally different features, shape and bone structure (small /round face, long, and somewhat heart shaped) . The glasses managed to look classy and trendy on all of them. Just a fair warning: they are covering most of the face given that they are large and square.",5
78128,This item is very cute & made a great gift.  The magnetic clip is a very nice touch & makes it easy to put on & take off. Glad that I decided to get it! Have not heard back that it messed up so I think the quality is very good!,5
808065,"These are really cute, soft cotton with a bit of stretch that will breathe and fit for a long time to come. They just don't fit now. They're advertised as Toddler/Infant/Kids/Children, but they definitely do not fit my infant (with a very normal, infant-sized head). He's 3 months old now, so I'll try again this winter. I stuck them in a drawer for the future, so no huge loss. Just figured I'd add to the reviews that these fit large on infants.",3
585041,The material is thick and scratchy.  I could only wear it for about an hour and had to take it off.  The design on it is a little blurred and you cannot actually make out the rat with a leash.  Disappointed with it and it is just sitting in my t-shirt drawer and more than likely will not be worn again. I would not recommend this product to anyone.,1
425879,"I really like this necklace set I bought another one previously in another color. But I bought this specifically beacuse it said it was Lavendar. But it is not even close, it is Beige or a Dark Cream color. It's still very pretty and I don't have time to send it back and get another one since this is a gift. But the color should be accurate.",3
78086,"Needed a cloth strap for use in outdoor activities that would withstand water, sweat, heat, dirt/mud and that could clean easily and last.

Though this strap is a bit shorter than most ""Zulu"" straps, the construction seems to be pretty tough with thick metal rings/buckle in PVD black steel and reinforced stitching at the rings which is better than ultrasonic welding.

We'll see how it lasts over the long haul but I think it'll hold up well...",5
771193,"Bought this shirt after reading the reviews. I'm a M/L and got a L. I'm a tall person and have long arms and this shirt is a good fit all around. The sleeves are long enough that they don't look too short as I move around. I ordered the orange pink, which I'm not too crazy about so I will be exchanging for a different color, but love the style and fit!!",5
507235,Worst fit i've ever had in a shirt. It's too small and too big at the same time. It's way too short and I don't even have a long torso it sits right above my waist line and then its huge above that. I don't know what they used to size this shirt but it wasn't a person. Terrible fit looks nothing like the picture.,1
125447,"I have a very big head. These hats are very nice and perfectly weathered, however they were too small for the size that I needed. There are only four sizes small medium large and extra-large. The extra-large is only about 19 to 20 inches. I have a 24 inch head. More brains! However, I did not use them in this purchase. returning",1
21626,"We love this hat. Lightweight, secure, and provides great protection for the harmful UVs up here in Colorado. Not to mention the shipping was incredible, our hat showed up a day early so we were able to hike the next day! I will be purchasing the next size up from this company when my son is ready.",5
817299,"This is really a cuter day flattering suit. The bottoms are full coverage and the waist falls just below the belly button.
The only issue I have is that the cups for the top are really rigid. I've never had a suit like this before. I guess the top holds its shape no matter what you are doing and it's not uncomfortable so it's a minor issue for me.",4
337357,"I didn't use it to go out yet. But I tried it when I received it. It's cute with the lace in the front. It lifts the butt but it doesn't compress the tummy. I should have ordered a small. I order medium, but as I wear medium in everything a small might have been more effective in compression of the tummy",4
594083,"Be aware ordering any clothing from Amazon.
A lot of it is from China and the it's doesn't fit you unless your all skin and bones,petite ,or super thin.
 People with a body type of avenge ,chubby ,etc it' won't fit no matter what size you select.

They measure their clothes differently from Americans.",1
420696,"These are so plush and soft!  They make you feel like you're walking on pillows - they're AWESOME!!!!  The only complaint I have is that they didn't seem to have them in smaller sizes, they were all for huge feet but it's actually okay - I thought it would be a bad thing but they still fit and even though they're a little big, they're not falling off or causing any problems when walking.  They're overall really great and nice quality!",5
686210,"This item I was actually giving as a gift. I ordered an extra large in this item but when it arrived I knew I was going to have to find another gift. The extra large ran more like a small.
The quality of the material seems to be good but I have not been able to actually test that due to the fact it runs so small.",1
729020,Great hat.  The inside is lined with fleece which provides an extra layer of warmth that is needed in the Midwest.  The mouth piece is also an added layer of protection from the elements and is also lined which is what is needed in the cold winter months. The best part is that it is also a fun hat to wear.,5
471649,"I really liked this.  It was a nice deal because it is two separate shirts and it was a really nice color.  I thought the material was different.  It is kind of shiny, which I wasn't crazy about, but if it had fit, I would have been okay with it.  It was just way to small.  I ordered the largest one that they have and I am a size 2 - 3x, but the shirt is more like a size 14.",2
701262,"Cons: the color isn't as bright of an orange. It is more like a ""warm orange"".  Also, I am 6 ft 260lbs, so like every ""long"" pants in my life, I have to wear them like capris. Smh .. at the struggle. But I am sure for average height women, it will be the perfect length...so don't let my review deter your purchase.

Pros: Stays up and is true to size. I bought an XL and it fits great. Since I am curvy at the hips, most pants ride down. These stay up well.",4
296347,The shoes are exactly as pictured I am an 8.5 and I ordered an 8.5 and they are a tiny big snug but not so much that they are to uncomfortable. I plan on ordereing more in another color but I will go up a half size and order a size 9 next time.,4
406749,"This is a really warm hoddie, a little heavy maybe and long of the arms, but it looks quite cool, I've received compliments about it, what i like the most is that it covers all your upper body and in really chilly nights u don't need nothing else but maybe a long sleeve tshirt underneath it and that's it'. Nice buy for a great price here in Amazon",4
877426,"Cute dress. I'm 5'4"" 145 lbs? I got the medium. My measurements are 40-28-38. I have a large chest so it fit well. Material is nice a comfortable and not see through. High low hem. Hope the pics help. I had this on my wish list for months but was worried about the fit. I've machine washed it on gentle and hung dry. Didn't need ironing. Good buy",5
827972,I take this backpack every day for work because of the easiness carrying it. The material is waterproof and very light. It has an interior string inside for more closure but I changed it because it was too long and the color white was not good for me. I put a black cord or string and it is much better. The medium size is perfect for me and the price was very reasonable.,5
423077,"""The item was not  what was described. The material was flimsy and the size is not accurate. The sizes run big so make sure you order one size smaller. There is absolutely no compression so they should not advertise that there is. I send them back with a tracking number which they received August 12th and I still have not received my refund (august 21)",1
268398,I was surprised that this clutch was so nice.  The leather is good quality and for the price it's a great buy.  Has a front compartment that can hold your cell phone and the inside is lined with 2 side pockets and another zipper compartment.  You can fit your wallet sunglasses and lip gloss very easily plus more.  It comes with 2 straps (wrist and shoulder) which makes it diverse and fun to carry.  I'm happy with this purchase.,4
298848,"I like the look of this but it is waayyyy too small. I am 5'8"", 140lbs, normally a size 6/M. I ordered an XL and it fits my 10 year old daughter who is 4'10"" and 79lbs. I can wear the lower portion as a higher waisted drawstring short so I will alter to be that.",1
792655,"I purchased this hat in anticipation of the hot, humid Florida weather that often arrives before the first day of spring.  This hat has two different beam directions that can be used individually or simultaneously.  I have worn it for probably six hours so far.  The battery pack is removable so that the hat can be washed, which is nice.  I paired the hat with a reflective sash and my running partner says she can see me coming down the road from two blocks away.  Would purchase again, and have recommended to others.",5
546898,"It's nice to see that in the skate industry they don't only make t shirts and hoodies with logos but also nice and simple shirts like these, I would've liked it if the olive green would've been a bit darker but aside from that, I like the fit and the color, fits just as expected, simple but looks nice with anything will order more soon.",5
314417,"The shipping was quick and the lace is nice, but it doesn't form as flat against the skin as I expected and kind of had trouble keeping it in place, nevertheless it did serve nicely for a Masquerade I went to. The ears are cute, but not as big nor 3D like the pic portrays.",4
857039,"Absolutely no padding, sheer, see through, no support and does not cover you up. You get what you pay for. I had a couple extra pads lying around that I use with it but on its own it does absolutely nothing and is completely useless. If you have bra pads to use it with, I guess it's worth buying, but there are much better bandeaus that come with actual pads and are good quality. This one is just a waste.",2
193188,"These are a great minimal shoe, but I needed something with a bit more sole, especially in the toe. Straight to the ground which is great if that is what you're looking for. They would be great for the gym, but I wouldn't recommend them for road running unless you have properly prepared for a minimal shoe.",4
204569,I LOVE this dress. I loved it when I saw it online and really hoped it would be as good as what I was expecting and it is!!! I'm so thrilled to have purchased this and hope this style comes in a variety of colors eventually. What a steal for something that looks professional for work or church.,5
156361,"Perfect for what I carry, it only holds 6 cards and 1 bill folded but anymore then that and it will not completely close all the way. The outside scratches easly but still keeps its finish so as long as you don't mind scratches it's great and I like it and use it every day. The life time warranty was also a major part of my decision to go with this particular wallet.",5
359560,"I don't know what this wallet is made out of but it is the most toxic smelling wallet that I have ever purchased and there is no way I would let my son have it.  It's terrible, because it looked cute, but I have never taken anything out of a box with such a strong smell.  Really terrible piece of garbage.",1
307173,The fabric feels like my Catholic School pants of days gone by...  Heavy and no stretch.  I feel like my order was hi-jacked by some sweatshop knock-off.  I have a different pair of Volcom chino shorts that are light and stretch -- the pair here were terrible.  Sent back for a refund.  Something is amiss...,2
535005,ove the item and I will buy one when the price comes down how to draw a big fan of the show the original series and  I would like to see more custom car parts For knight rider  on Amazon so someone originally could build their own version I know that I would,5
600780,"I am a lady so the sneakers look rather larger on my foot in my opinion. However when I wore them, many people have stopped to compliment me. I enjoy wearing them particularly when I ride my hands free sedway!  If you consider buying these, I promise you will be the only one with them! A very unique item for sure!",4
755968,"This is not a two piece item with a skirt and shirt, its a dress and the bottom is not nude its a mesh white and around the waist. Also the material is very thin and mine came with a hole in the mesh... Had the potential to be very cute",2
269166,"I love the color of this purse and I get compliments on it all the time.  I've been using it for about 3 months and all the pockets and zippers still work great, no tearing or stitching coming loose.  I carry a lot of things in my purse and sometimes it can get heavy with water bottles and the like but all of the stitching has held up the weight.",5
323580,"This is a great cap! I am a girl and I think I have a fat head so I was a little worried plus it came in the mailbox in a big yellow envelope. My first thought was it's crushed! But luckily it wasn't. Very cute, just like the picture. Fits nicely. I would definitely order this again.",5
420680,I ordered this hat in pink earlier last year to nothing but rave reviews.  This time when I ordered the black one you see pictured it had missing studs and looked banged up I don't think I would chance ordering this hat again and this is awful because the first one is gorgeous and this one was awful.,1
446322,"These are really pretty. They look great with my Persona bracelet. I have a couple Persona beads, but a majority of the beads I have are rand beads I bought through Amazon. These beads are a bit smaller than the Persona bead of the same style, but it's not a big deal. These shine just as bright as the Perona bead.",4
875152,"I was so excited to find this tank! But I'm bummed to report there is a flaw in the screen print that fills the negative space of the gun with white ink - it's like the gun is censored. You can not tell what she is holding, since it blends in with her face. I'll still wear it since voting day is tomorrow, I'm just disappointed. I see the same flaw on another poster's review photo too... bummer!",2
24547,"Quality is very good. The insulation is perfect and the zippers are strong and sturdy. The pockets are a perfect size and it works very well in the crazy Colorado weather. The size is a little larger than I expected; but I  actually have come to like the extra room, and I don't find it uncomfortable at all. I wear it every day and have no complaints.",4
607498,"Hated this dress, it was a completely different dress. The dress in this picture is black and a light pink, the dress I received was navy blue with gold. Completely different and very very cheaply made dress. It was extremely small too. I ordered a size 16 dress and I received a dress that did not have any tags on it. No where did it say the size of the dress. I'm pretty sure the dress I received was a Size 6 or 4. EXTREMELY small. Do not waste your time or money.",1
50771,"Extremely uncomfortable. Tried two different sizes but couldn't wear it for more than 10 minutes at a time. It either pushes extra fat out the top or bottom, and pinches when I try to sit. Impossible to nurse while wearing. I'll just stick with the eating right/working out to lose the gut, which appears to be working fine.",1
259791,"I was looking for a basic strappy top and though I would risk trying despite other 'warnings'.  This was so sheer that I had to send it back, very cheaply made but I should have known that with the price... I loved the strappy look but you would definitely have to wear a sports bra or something under it to cover 'nippleage' or headlights showing =) I don't mind that but way to sheer, thin for my liking.",3
443466,"My dad usually wears a large, but I ordered medium based on reviews. He says it is a perfect fit and he loves it! He was so excited about how he's never seen a shirt like it, which is a challenge when everything he wears has Vietnam Vet and Army on it.",5
642777,"I was worried about how the T-shirt would be considering there weren't any reviews on it; however, my worries subsided when the shirt arrived! It's an awesome shirt -- well made. And the Star Trek Animated Series Retro Logo is actually perfect! It doesn't stand out to much, which is how I like my shirts. I really like the ventage look. Also the tag says ""Star Trek"" on it, which makes it more official, unlike other shirts that just slap and image on a random T-shirt. Over all, it's worth it's price.",5
474454,"I'm going to tie this bandana to my luggage to make it easier to spot at the airport.  I'm sure it will work well.  I love the design and color.  The bandana looks to be of good quality material and stood up well to washing.  No shrinking noticed, yet.",5
868051,"This product smelled awful when I opened the package.  I liked the fit so I washed it with detergent in warm water.  Unfortunately, it still smells just as bad.  Smells like dead fish.  I can't determine what could be smelling like that unless it is simply the cheap fabric of which it is made.",1
794585,"Sizing seems a little off.  They fit big which is fine because they can be grown into. I bought the Fulham size 6 by dl1961 and it was snug, almost fit too small in a six. Sizing seems all over the place. Quality is good in both pairs though so far.",4
138236,Surprising quality for 2$ & much faster delivery than stated. Why spend 50$ when 2$ provides the same enjoyment! I will order more. They'd be great for travel so even if you wanted to discard after using no problem. We've had awkward instances where we had to contact property managers to retrieve pricey racy lingerie..lol,5
709004,"Looking at the reviews I decided to buy 1 size up and get a medium which was a bad idea this was a lil too big for me and length wise to short it was very flimsy and cheap material used to make this , if you do buy this it's best you wear it in the summer, other than that I was a waste of money I'm my opinion",2
10598,I like the look of this but I was thinking it would be more spandex-y instead of cotton. It also runs very small and my 11-year-old (regular-sized) boy is too big for the XL size I bought. I figured reading the reviews that they would run small so I ordered up but once I was these they'll probably be too small as they are already too short and look like briefs almost.,3
438403,"Lots of points for comfort. Super soft yoga pants. They make me look pretty great! At 5'2"" the legs are much too long for me. I got them hemmed about 2.5 inches and the boot-cut opening feels a little big for my shape. If they offered petite sizes these babies would have 5 stars from me.",4
597067,"I like the shirt, but it runs very small, I am normally a medium and ordered an XXL based on the reviews and the sleeves don't come down to my wrists, I planned on rolling them anyway.  So, purchase at your own peril, the models must have been pubescent.",4

So this time I ordered a 5nice and its not going anywhere! Lol. The ring itself isn't too big and doesn't look gawdy. I get a lot of compliments on it. I just really love this since I can't afford my ""dream"" ring yet. You can't beat it for the price!",4
442147,"I give it a 4 star rating only because the sizing is very difficult to guess. My child is almost 3 years old and he usually wears a size of a 4 year old kid, so I bought size 4 and it nearly fits him. Otherwise the material is soft, the colors and vivid.",4

My engagement ring is a 3.5, and this ring fits exactly the same way.  I haven't had it long, so I don't know how it is with scratches or anything, but for an $18.00 ring, it's pretty decent.",5
806060,Zero stars are too many for this product. I've never been this disappointed with anything before. The robe was wadded up and put into a plain plastic bag. It was opened and the whole thing looked like it had been washed many times. The fabric was coarse and thin. I would never consider using this thing with a baby. Maybe it would be good to check the oil on my car.,1

192630,This is the type of nose ring I was looking for. I noticed that in the comments people are saying how the ring made their nostril swell up after they put in the ring. They also said they soaked them in alcohol. Well no duh. You're not supposed to soak piercings with alchocol because it dries them out so of course your nostril is going to get irritated. Soak them with hydrogen peroxide instead. No problems with this nose ring at all.,5

791260,I have a very slender neck and this choker compliments it really well. I like that its a pack of 3 coz I tend to lose things easy and its better to have spares.

So they do run small. Order at least one size larger.,4
399025,"I wanted to help clarify the question about the inside stamping on the ring.  Yes, it is stamped ""PLAT"" for platinum, and yes, it is stamped ""Amazon"" for Amazon.com. I would have really preferred the ring without the Amazon stamp on the inside, but it is a nice ring.  I'm still trying to decide if the fit is right, but it looks great.",4
380373,I love this cover up!! Looked fabulous on when I bought it. But I made the mistake of washing it in the washer and it shrunk so much that I can't even put it on!!!!! I washed in cold water and did not dry it!! So do NOT wash it!!! Hand wash only. It has no tag for u to read washing instructions. So mine is ruined.... But cute as long as u don't wash!,4
535835,"This is exactly what I was looking for-a stretchy hat that stays on, just like the ones at the hospital. I should've ordered these before he was born!

I just got this one, and ordered 2 more. Love it. And the seller is great too- hats arrived within 2 days of ordering, and seller was excellent about returning another style hat I didn't like.",5
114904,"I love the look of this dress and while shipping did take a while I'm happy with the dress. As far as sizing, I'm 5'10"" and 138lbs and I got a small and it's a perfect fit. Actually the neck line works well. I don't think it's too low as I have bras that go perfectly with it and I didn't feel the need to pin the neck line or add a cloth under it.",4
517168,Loved it! Arm holes are a little tight but beyond that it was great. Just the right amount of coverage on the top. Skirt is a good length not too long or too short. Panties have elastic around legs that have that old fashioned feel about them that makes you feel so naughty,5
767821,Dress was gorgeous it fit me beautifully. My problem was the corset backing goes far beyond the bodice. It laces down about half way to your bum. My bum caused the bottom of the corset to bunch up and it made me look like I had a tail. It seems such a long corset backing would only work for someone who does not have a well endowed backside. Besides that I loved it. I wish it worked out for me. Ended up returning it. Seller was attentive and understanding.,2
861500,"These stood up well on my first day of use at the beach, they were snug fit and did not allow any sand inside while giving a solid step over rocks, shells, etc. They also have no sharp edges to cut or puncture the inflatable kayak I was in most of the day. Only downside is there is near zero support for the arch and not much cushioning. I would not want to walk on concrete or asphalt with them, but beach and water use is fine",4
403521,"These Peridot earrings are absolutely fabulous. They didn't cost a lot which makes them even more fabulous. The one thing I would change is the backs. I would like them to be bigger,and therefore easier to attach to my ears. The sterling silver is great because I have relatives who are allergic to any fake metals such as goldtone, and people love to get earrings in the mail. It's fun!",5
637111,"This shirt is so great! It has thick material so it's not as super thin as a lot of urban outfitters and pacsun shirts. It is definetly not coffee colored like siad in the description, but it is great! I ordered it knowing this because of other reviews. It is perfect for fall time and it's a sort of a pumpkin color.
 Overall great for the price and great feeling. (also super soft)",5
846407,I honestly do not even know how this fits.  Mine arrived with the zipper sewn shut.  The stitches go right through the plastic zipper and have bent it.  If I took out those stitches the zipper would still be too damaged to use.  The print is a ridiculous copy of a worse copy of the original print shown in the stock photo.  The pictures show how blurry the print is and exactly how far the zipper comes down.  I would love a replacement that I can ACTUALLY TRY ON.,1
461040,"The fabric is super soft, the colors are beautiful, and the price is great!  It is more like a large, sheer scarf that is large enough to tie and use as a coverup (as picture shows). It could also be worn as a beautiful scarf. I would recommend and buy again.",4
558156,"Too large for my 8mo-old to really be comfortable in right now; just as well, he doesn't play in the snow yet and its ok that it's big--he normally is in 9-12mos stuff, so I took a chance.  It will pay off next year, as we take care with our things, and I'm sure he'll use it next season.",5
514140,"I wanted a denim bag with pockets/dividers and some size to it.
This fits that. Don't particularly like the useless ""wings"" on either end but carabiniers took care of those. Removed the handles and attached the shoulder strap. Otherwise, it is a good bag for my purposes and a fair price.",4
565310,"I expected that it would run a bit small after reading previous comments, but it was extremely small. What really disappointed me though was the color. From the picture it appears to be just black which is what I expected and wanted. However it has white highlights all over the embroidered pattern. Overall a miss, but not worth sending back so we'all make it work.",2
264371,"Well it was written that its swarovski, but the u can see the pack ""p&m"" by yourself,  also that it has three layers white gold, but there is no any alloy on it prooving that its real gold. I bought it for a present and have no idea how to gift it now. I am very disappointed, its too irresponsible!!",2
825823,I bought this for my wife she said it fit perfect and she loved it. The only this she didn't like was the slit on the inside of the dress was too short for her liking but really loves the skirt otherwise. Shipping did take a while so be patient.,5
265036,"I love these! They were a little big to begin with, but babies grow like weeds and my munchkin is now fitting into them perfectly. I especially love colorful the dinosaur one, it looks really cute on him, and I love dinosaurs! I will be buying these again if they come in larger sizes.",5
327562,"The product does keep my face warm; however, its a little big and the top part rolls back onto my head, so I have to wear a beanie w/it.  I would've purchased the product anyway because it does come through on the warmth part.  Also, there are straps on the sides that are supposed to make the product fit more snug, but one of my straps came not functioning and perhaps that is why it seems too large.",3
288197,"Who doesn't love a good ol' classic pair of Chucks? ;) They go with anything... just adds a little funk to your step! I've been wearing Converse since I was a preteen- now into my late 20s I still love them since the first day I owned a pair. I have very arched feet, but my chucks are the first shoes I go to when I was working, going on a walk or going to a concert. They last forever, and are super durable! I've never had a complaint, and these ones were perfect as well. Arrived quickly as well!",5
230883,These r basically nylons.. Not impressed.. And they have an odd chemical smell to them..  Even after 2 wash cycles. Also they don't fit well. I am 5.5 - 140 ( prchse the largest) bottom line.. They suck... The 5 star rating is either bogus.. Or they got something else. I threw them away.,1
182511,"It's perfect for my petite girl, though it is a little short, she has very long legs, probably could have requested a size larger, but made that mistake before, this is perfect,  she may grow out of it in 6 months,  but for Kumoricon,  it's awesome,  quality product,  I will be back because of the thoughtfulness of the seller, to make sure this was what we wanted. I am happy (so is my daughter), thankyou!",5
185216,"The bracelet itself is cute, it was huge on my wrist but I have a small wrist so no big deal, I was able to fix it. But as all the other reviews out there, it broke as soon as I took it off. I tried it on and took it off and it broke both in the front where the clasp is and the other end where the chain is. It gets 2 starts because it's a nice wrap bracelet but the quality is pretty bad.",2
628678,This is such a cute suitcase! I love the color and the inside fabric looks like the inside of a child's purse. I mean that in a good way. It really fits the outside well. The suitcase works better than another major brand at the airport and fits better under the seat. I highly recommend this.,4
98245,"These are nice for support, but I agree with other reviewers that they are footless tights, not leggings. They are very see through. I appreciate their breathability because I'm pregnant in the summer in Southern US, but I think at least the top portion of the leggings should be thicker.",4
179050,"I am a serious biker, and the wind, particularly if chilly, makes my eyes tear producing a serious problem of seeing oncoming as well as traffic from the side, so these are the perfect solution for me. I have used them for at least two years and had them fallout of my rear jersey pocket and hit the concrete and had no problem. They did not break.",4
26935,"Great shoe inserts.  Takes a few days to ""break them in"" but the time is well spent.  During the break in period the insoles are rathe still but after about a week of everyday wear, they and your feet have become one with one another and the wear experience is pure joy.

I will buy again when these wear out.",5
308087,"Just bought this strap to replace a thick leather strap on my Panarai; this strap is wonderful!! It looks just like pictured and is a soft tight suede feel.  Is very easy to break-in as the strap is a little stiff; just bend the straps back and forth a few times before attaching to watch.  It is very comfortable to wear, and I will buy again. You can not beat the price.",5
875261,"The quality is good. However, the description and image show a dark brown strap with gold hooks. That is definitely NOT what I got. I received a medium brown strap with silver hooks! It totally does NOT match the bag I bought it for! Considering this strap cost me about 50% of what the bag is worth, I would like to get the product that was actually advertised!",2
641240,"This shirt is cheaply made, you can tell just by looking at it out of the plastic. There are strings hanging off of many of the buttons and it is way too small. I bought XXL and my arms don't fit in it though I consider myself a L/XL size. I will be returning it.",1
50938,This product really helps with support after giving birth. It also helps to smooth and flatten the appearance of your stomach. I'm not sure about long term results because I've only been wearing for about 1.5 weeks. My only complaint is the fact that you can see the place where the Velcro crosses over in the front which you can then see underneath clothes.,4
397179,"I purchased this watch because I was looking for a digital watch with a metal band.  I have always had great experiences with Timex watches.  However, this band is very weak and doesn't hold up to much.  It broke the first day I wore it for work.  The watch itself I'm sure is good.  I had a Timex watch that lasted eight years before the battery ran out.  I just don't suggest this particular band.",2
23733,"I bought this hat a couple years ago and it has stood the test of time. Durable, good looking, wonderful fit, this hat is what you're looking for. The bill of other fatigue hats are too short. This one has a perfect bill and the hat keeps its square like shape when worn and is adjustable. I used this hat for cosplaying a scout from Team fortress 2 (TF2.) Best hat for that costume!",5
222252,"I was a little leery buying one size fits all leggings as I usually wear a large, but these were great! They aren't quite 100% opaque, but they did the job and were definitely not see-through. I bought these to wear under a pinkie pie dress as a costume on halloween. I just worse some beige/skin colored underwear underneath and it looked perfect! They were really comfortable as well!",5
453782,"These are horrible! I bought two pairs and they equally suck! Way too small, way too thin, poorly constructed (crotch seams completely missed!!) and they smell of a chemical- bug spray, gasoline or diesel or something nasty! I have initiated return and I have to PAY to return these crappy pants...BOOOOOOOOOO",1
641215,"People need to read the descriptions before they order. This shirt is exactly as described. It fits well, I got an XXL and normally wear a 6-8 US. If anything it is a little on the big side, which is perfect for layering. Overall great quality. Like it so much that I am ordering the lighter color and sending out a plea for more colors, maybe in a duck cloth?",5
133037,"I bought these for my wife as an anniversary present.  I intended her to use these in the second hole in her ears.  They are perfect for this and she absolutely loves them.  Not an expert on diamond jewelry, but they seem of good quality for the price.  I only hope they will give her many years of use.",5
203173,"I get so many compliments on how cute it is! But it's very sturdy, and well made. I know I will get a lot of enjoyment and use out of it. (Side note, I am able to fit my Galaxy Note 4 in the zippered pouch, so it doubles as a clutch when I am out.)",5
296168,"These are my most favorite pair of boots I own! I love the ankle height, the fringe, the color...everything! As a teacher, I'm constantly trying to find cute, fashionable shoes that are comfortable, since I'm on my feet all day, and these do the trick! I am buying them in a second color, because I love them so much and have gotten so many compliments on them!",5
259669,"I liked this so much, but it was irritating around the shoulders and was too short.  I wanted to love it!! I am in the process of returning it, and Amazon makes it so easy.  I'm 5'5 and 160 lbs.  I bought a large after reading reviews. So disappointed.",4
743759,"I always laugh when they say thigh highs because they never are. I don't think my legs are especially long, especially my calves but yet these always stop right around the knee or just above. Maybe because I have muscle in my legs, I don't know.

27"" inseam, athletic calves and quads.",4
444539,"I bought a size 7 for my 12 year old daughter who might weigh 100 lbs and is about 5'2"".  They look great and she loves them.  Luckily I read the other reviews and saw how small they run.  In this case the small size was perfect.",4
48553,"... This is a fine belt. But the problem for me is that it is not made of leather. It was my mistake in purchasing it as the ""woven"", rather than the ""stretch"", was what caught my attention in the description. My bad. After a long day at work I made a human mistake when ordering. Life goes on.",3
844864,"I love the fit of my dress.  I am 5'5"" and weigh 240 pounds.  I ordered a size 3x and it fits perfectly.  The only thing is that you need to wear some sort of protection as far as spanks because it show all of your imperfections.",5
128946,The front of this top is beautiful. It is also slimming which is impressive since it is white. It stretches a lot so it is very comfortable. The back on the other hand is plain and shows all the bumps caused by my bras. I guess I will have to wear it with a sweater.,4
783672,"im 6'3"" tall and 270lbs.  now I do have a beer belly and this fit perfect with plenty of room for layers.  the sleeves fit my arm length perfect.  the only down fall,  to many pockets, I loose things  lol.  also a pocked liner gave out on first outing, but was able to sew easily  I bought the 2x  was ice fishing in snow and wind, 10 degrees F  and I am glad I had it,  love this coat",5
605122,It's a bit small and the straps want to fall down all the time. There should be some sort of strap or something across the top to provide tension to keep the straps on the shoulders. If you don't mind adjusting them every few minutes then it's a great top.,3
731639,"This is a pretty decent coat.  I'm about 5' 10"" and 160 lbs, size L is comfortable even if I wear a hoodie under it.  I wish I had ordered black or grey instead of the navy blue, it's just a different shade of blue than what I expected.",4
54054,"My wife bought this hat to keep our 5 month old daughter safe from the sun while they are outside.  In my opinion, the hat is pretty big and looks a bit goofy on her head, but my wife and her friends think it looks adorable and the baby doesn't seem to mind wearing it.

Above all, it successfully keeps the sun out of her face, which is the whole point of the hat to begin with.",4
69016,"My toddler loves these shoes....they are great quality for the price and fit pretty standard size wise. The only problem is they can be difficult to get on a squirming toddler and while they stay on during play, they come off way too easily...toddlers LOVE to take their shoes off so this can be a pain.",4
416801,"The flag is nice, but the clasp on the back is very cheap and not worthy of the pin.  I am concerned that I will lose the pin.  I bought one of these a couple of years ago from you and it had a good, solid, silver clasp on the back and I still wear it on my leather jacket.  This one, I would not trust wearing for concern of losing it.  I will probably send it back.",3
315816,"These are cute, however the actual quality is so poor! The gemstones are loose in all three and look like they are going to fall out. Plus the actual quality and look of the gems is also a little poor. I was really looking forward to these and I am very disappointed. I may return them.",2
518421,"I purchased this bag with the intent to carry a tablet/laptop around NYC while traveling.  I didn't end up having to use it but this bag is too cute!
The color and style is very versatile as it can go from casual to professional.
Once I get more use out of this bag I may update but for now I'm digging it!",5
59059,The wallet is very nice and wonderful quality. It is not cheap looking and is made very well. I got this for my son and he loves it. He can carry all that he needs and it fits in his pockets just fine. We received the wallet on time as expected.,5
164539,"These leggings are THE BEST purchase I have ever made on Amazon. I love the thick band at top that makes you feel secure, yet the material is just so comfortable and flattering. These are literally SOOO comfy and super stretchy! I will be purchasing more of these in the future. Highly recommend!",5
109656,"Very simple dress, meaning it's easy to dress up.  The color is spot on.  Surprisingly elegant, but that tends to be common among maxi dresses.  It can be worn during the day, but I prefer to wear this when going to dinner with friends.  Looks incredible paired with gold accessories.",5
613935,"Such a pretty bra! I wore it during the last few weeks of pregnancy and it was pretty comfortable, even with the underwires. Now that I'm nursing I haven't worn it as often because I've dealt with clogged ducts and I'm staying away from underwires until my milk supply evens out.",4
290895,"The material is very stretchy even though its like a cotton material. Kinda reminds me of a one size fits all. I'm 5'5, 147 pounds and I would have liked for it to be more fitted. I will say that the set is made really well. It looks exactly like the picture.",3
659782,I purchased the bracelet to complement the tattoo necklace I bought a while back. Both of them look very real. I had someone ask me a few days ago if I had a tattoo or if it was a bracelet. What more can you ask for? :-) The bracelet is very comfortable to wear and doesn't move around on your wrist. The price is most certainly right.,5
805020,"I was really excited for these leggings and then I finally get them in today, and they're purple. I ordered the 004 which is definitely blue in the picture and these are not blue. Pretty sure they sent me the wrong color and now it's too late to get a new pair in before Halloween, thus, ruining my costume.

At least they're cute.",2
829032,"I was surprised at how good the quality was for this suit.  The cut and colors were accurate compared to the picture.  I wore this to several weeks of swim lessons and did not notice any fading or stretching.  The bra padding is strangely thick, but you can remove the pads or replace them if you don't like it.",5
277898,awesome waist shaper. i'v purchased many at department stores and nothing compares to this one. it actually gives you an hour glass shape.i had to lay down to put it on from bottom up  and i actually started to feel my body heat up also. but it was well worth it when i saw the shape it gave me.,5
826881,"I tried Luck Leaf Sunglasses and was very impressed on how they fit and comfortable they were. I really like the style of the glasses as it has a metal frame with the round lens making it a very nice fit covering my eyes.

Disclosure: I received this item for free for review purposes and all thoughts and opinions are of my own.",5
277299,"The sunglasses themselves are fine. They're a little tight if you have a giant head like I do. The look a little small on my face, but I like the style and they seem well made.

The shipping is the reason I took 2 stars off this review. They put the glasses in a plain lightly padded envelope. When I received the glasses they were bent flat. I was able to bend them back into a relatively pleasing shape, but that's not really how that should work. Invest in an actual box, knockoff sunglass people.",3
549513,"I Lost my wedding ring and needed a new one. My first one was tungsten and I loved the weight of it. I found this one which is almost identical to my old one. I recived it in sooner than expected. It fits great, the width is perfect, the weight is spot on, Super Comfortable, and best of all it doesn't scratch. I am more than pleased. Everytime I look at it I say, ""Wow, I love this ring!""",5
571226,"I was skeptical at first because I never ordered from this company but I love, love love this handbag.  Bright beautiful orange color made of a good quality.  Very stylish, can be used dressed or causal.  Not too big or small, just the right size.  The price was nice for a leather bag.  Will surely  order other styles.",5
262837,"I returned this.  It is cute, but the size is way off.  The bracelet is child-size, so they gave an extender.  Thank you for the extender, but now it's giant-size.  If you have very small or very large wrists, it may fit you nicely.  It might also be good for an anklet if you have small ankles.",2
874370,"Purchased this as a Christmas gift for my sister who's a big Bob Ross fan. Shipping was quick! The tshirt itself seems to be made of good material, the logo is a good size and centered but you can tell it was just ironed on which is why I'm only giving it four stars. I know my sister will love it and for the price it was worth it.",4
831119,"I have had to buy this bathing suit three times. The first two I blamed my husband for washing the tops for them breaking, but I just wore this for the first time since I bought it and the underwire is broken. I hadn't even worn it yet and its past return time.

I am happy to reconsider this review or post pictures if needed if I can get one that will not break. I have proof I have bought it more than once.",2
81620,"This is very nice with lots of storage and it looks wonderful, my husbands only issue was that it was a little to bulky to put in pocket.  There is a snap in it and that prevents it from being slim.  My husband likes it and usually just carries wallet in coat for winter so it's fine for that but I think for summer he may want a thinner one.  It is very nice and he does like it :)",4
406657,"I had gotten this as a gift for a friend, and she wasn't terribly satisfied.
She said it was cheaply made, and the second day she wore it, a few of the studs had fallen off.
I told her I would get an exchange, but she was quite annoyed and refused to buy again from this seller.",2

The product is all that you could want; well made, pure silk, warm and comfortable.  The neck is long enough to keep the cold drafts out.  I""ll be sleeping warm in those cold mountain nights!",5
258892,Great swim diaper. Definitely get two because if your little one poos while at the pool you will need a second!  We cloth diaper so this was an easy choice and I like that they are white so that they easily match all suits.  Plus disposable swim diapers are crazy expensive for a small pack.  Get this and wash with the swim suit and you are good to to!  Does take a while to dry is the one downfall.,5
465369,"The picture shows these to be SKINNY jeans!  You would have to have serious cankles for the legs to be considered ""skinny"" on these!  I am not a small girl by any means and the legs past the knees were HUGE!  They are straight leg, NOT SKINNY!",1
840870,"I love these. I love the design. They did however take a decent amount of time to come in. They fit well. I wore them around the first I got them, and they held up to everything I was doing. I did notice that the crotch area seems to sag and I had to adjust them several times throughout the day to prevent chub rub. But other than that small irritant, I do like them.",5
109848,My dad was excited to see these that I had purchased for my sons and husband.  It's the same brand and the same great workmanship he has enjoyed since the 1950s when he was in grade school.  Thank you for your dedication to providing a quality product over so many decades and keeping it American made!,5
808452,The product was exactly what I expected from the photos and product description. It's a great solution for a shirt or dress with a neckline that is cut too low. The fabric is light weight enough to lay nicely beneath another garment and has plenty of stretch which allows the product to stay put.,5
269481,"I like this wallet. It's a great size for my purse. Not too big or too small with plenty of slots for debit and/or debit cards plus side inserts for a drivers license or photo I.D. I like how there are 2 compartments. The other side of the wallet you can put coins, cash, business cards, etc. it's a multi-purpose wallet. The quality is good and I would recommend.",4
523627,"Very nice. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is due to the odor. I didn't wash it because I fear it will ruin the color, but I left it hanging out for a few days and the smell evaporated. Otherwise it's a very nice purchase for the money.",4
364630,I tried these sleepers because of the reviews and price.  I usually get carters and they are typically almost double the price...  I wasn't expecting better or equal quality to the carters but I was still very disappointed.  The fleece material was soft to the touch but I suspect it will pill easily after a few washes; it is not the micro fleece that carters sleepers use.  These also had a very strong chemical odor to them; even my husband who has a bad sense of smell noticed it.  Being returned.,1
663552,"I ordered the XL, which stretches a bit.  These are comfortable and seem well made, stitching is holding up under the assault.  Very affordable and quite pretty.  I am 5'8"" and the leg rises a little high.  It would get 5 stars if they offered a 2X.  It is much easier to get to the gym if you have cool and comfortable, attractive attire to wear - at least for me.",4
55182,I'll hold onto them for when his foot gets bigger but the product description is very misleading. It states they are a size 1 when in fact they are a 1-3 in size. Which is much bigger than I needed. I really wanted something to span from the little kids 13 to the big kids 1. this definitely won't do.,3
326947,"Great suit! Great Price!

I absolutely love this color, not too dark but still look very professional. I ordered online a few days before a business speech and they fit me perfectly, barely had to get them tailored. All I had to do was adjust the pants length. Saved me so mych money buying it online!",5

Also, I typically wear a bigger Medium/smaller large  so i ordered the Large and it fits really well but its loose on my back.",5
165130,"The black ones are a different material. Not as flexible and the fabric is kind of rough.

But the black ones are garbage, which is disappointing, because I would like to have some regular black workout pants.",2

The socks are so low profile that I had a lot of skin contacting the shoes which may as well have been like wearing no socks at all. My feet would sweat and cause my feet and shoes to smell. The rubber heal strip was nice in theory but it didn't always work, leaving me walking on my sock until I could discreetly fix the problem.",3

I just slide them in easily after wearing everyday and the boots don't stink, have kept surprisingly great shape, and I don't get annoyed at having to pull the trees out because the spring-load (which seems quite durable after about a year) and pull-tab are well designed.  I'm happy with the purchase.",5

Valentine's Day is right around the corner and giving your boyfriend a pearl necklace will show him just how much you care.  A very, very thoughtful gift!",5

I did make some adjustments to the dress as it doesn't flare as depicted in the photo. So, I wore a fluffy tulle skirt underneath. The plan is to have my dressmaker sow some tulle under it and take it in a bit to make the top a little tighter and the bottom flare. I purchased a size 6 per the review but, it is stretchy so I could have gotten away with the size 4.",5

It does smells. It didn't bother me at first, but it got worse as I started using it. I'm sure febreze or a dryer sheet will fix it. The purse looks like buffed leather, but it is more pebbly. This and the fact that the purse is wrinkled, making the purse look more old and worn than it actually is. I wouldn't pay this much for it if I saw it in a store.",3

Only negative is the padded/underwire bra - way to small.,2

The designs on the sleeves and pocket are made of a different fabric than the shirt, so there is a different feel from the rest of the shirt in the sleeve area.

The dimensions on the listing are accurate, but holding it in your hand, and feeling it in your pocket the difference is very noticeable. That extra 1/2 inch in width, and 1/4 inch in length make a big difference. I'll use it until I find a replacement for my old J. Crew one.",3

It is very sturdy and well put together. I use it very often and have purchased more from Scarleton. I'm a new fan!!,5
195309,I am used to sports bras that are a little bit more snug to provide support for being active. I also don't like how the back fits. Its cute in the photo but there isn't enough substance to the material to actually look like that or stay like that. I think its just too thin of a material to be a good sports bra.,2
359986,I LOVE these glasses. I mean who doesn't love the wayfarer style??? They are comfortable and really unique. I get asked about them all the time. I haven't had them long enough to test them out in the water yet but I am so excited that they float! Who hasn't lost a pair of glasses on the lake or in the ocean! I will definitely be recommending these to my friends and family! They are also great for gifting to the water lovers in my life!,5
825386,I LOVE this pattern and I really love how this dress fits but the tie on the left side of my dress was hanging on by a thread. I shouldn't have to repair a new dress before wearing it. I would buy so many dresses like this if the quality was better.,2
773892,"The dress didn't fit at all. It was too tight in places, too large in other places, and literally a foot too long. The neckline is extremely unflattering in larger sizes. Some of the seams and hems were frayed. What's worse, return shipping costs more than the dress. I'm going to try to have these tailored, but I expect that to cost the same amount.

Buyer beware.

I'm never buying dresses online again.",1

I finally tired of the questioning, and fessed to it being CZ. She was still thrilled and even more excited to know I had purchased such a great piece of jewelry without spending a fortune. The clasp is strong and has not come open once, not even when caught on an article of clothing. I would purchase this item again.",5

She's very petite, 5'2"" and wears a juniors XS or 00, the skirt fits great, has plenty of stretch in it so it could easily fit several sizes larger than her. The top however is pretty baggy. I would guess that it would be a good fit if you normally wear a juniors Medium or so. Material is nice, the yellow is very vibrant. Pretty cool set.",5
831925,"I can't rate it five stars because the top was tight and it didn't really have any padding at all. I do however like the material the swimsuit is made out of. I like the fact there is multiple colors you can choose between. I do recommend ordering two sizes up.

It reads ""ASICS Utility Stretch Refu Running Gloves, Utility/Grey,"" however the item is actually (as pictured) a pair of slightly-elastic reflective wrist bands with velcro closures. They measure 1.5"" wide x 11.5"" long. Their maximum circumference when closed is about 5"", which allows me to wear them on my wrists or ankles (to pull up some of the length of my too-long running pants). Good quality, bright neon fabric with super-reflective stripes.",4
550595,"I am so, so happy with this product. They are made of great quality leather as advertised, and are really durable. I got these as a gift for my dad for the winter and he loved them. When I told him how much they cost, he was shocked. These make an excellent gift!",5
371806,"I bought this because of the drawstring sides when I was pregnant last summer. I was worried that the long sleeves would bug me (that they would drip water everywhere or that I would get too hot). I'm happy to report that none of those things happened. In fact, after swimming, the long sleeves stayed wet enough to keep me cool without dripping water everywhere I went. I was in my third trimester all summer, and this covered my belly perfectly (I believe I sized up for that reason).",5
184499,I ordered the black shirt and it was absolutely amazing my favorite shirt. It fit  perfect. I liked it so much I decided to order a second one in pink. The pink is not pink it's peach and the caller is way too high. It lays just below my ears. it's 10 sizes too big but I ordered one size smaller than the black.,3
634771,"This is definitely a party shirt. It is a casual, shiny black shirt, not for everyday wear or for the office. It is well made and seems like it will last. I have not, as yet, washed it.
It is very  attractive, and attention getting.
I have to admit that the fit was a bit small through the chest. The neck should, according to the sizing chart button up, but the neck is just a bit too small for that.
This is a lovely item, my only recommendation to perspective buyers is to go up a size to ensure a good fit.
Recommended",4

These guys need more anthro shirts. Just saying...",5

I wasn't  expecting this to be as beautiful as it is, I love it. The seller did a wonderful job getting it shipped and to my home quickly and efficiently.

I wasn't sure what quality they would be as they were extremely affordable (can't remember the price).  They are nice quality and keep my head really warm, even on a 19 night.  The knit allows for breathability and I have yet to get sweaty while wearing it, even indoors.  I would definitely purchase these again.",5

For the price this dress is exactly as I expected. I am a small framed, 5'2"" 123lbs with a large bust. I ordered the large and it is perfect. It is not to short at all. I can actually wear it to work. I love it and will be looking for more from this seller.",5
552928,This product is very deceiving. When I received it looked like my 9 year old grandchild attempted to use a sewing machine for the first time.  I hate it with a passion and will never order anything else from this company. The only reason it received a star is because it would not allow me to write a review without a rating.,1

wash, and keep clean, make my feet feel relaxed.  I buy two pairs each season so that I can have a pair to use constantly.  The
winter Snoozies are amazingly warm for my feet which usually get cold.  You cannot beat the price and quality!",5
275322,A great belt but the buckle was not as contrasting as it appears in the picture . I thought it was essentially black and did not have the silver tone has shown here . I had ordered the brown Model 167 and it was as pictured. I have nothing but praise for these belts with the linxx buckle. Just wanted to let people know that this particular model 167 is not as pictured!,5

Ive worn them all day at school and at disneyland. Everyone that sees them wants to know where i have got them! Amazing purchase!!!",5

The ""keyhole"" in the back was a disproportionately tiny loop that looked out of place. I tried it with leggings, but ultimately I found that I wasn't wearing it because of the low quality and awkward fit. It's a shame because this style looks so darn cute online!",2
619640,The blouse is just as pretty as described.  I ordered an extra large and although the tag does say XL it must be no larger than a medium.  I can't get it on at all and I wear L or XL normally.  It came on time with no issues.,2

Dress looks exactly like picture....size is what I expected (I went to local dress shops to try on to know how dresses run....for those who have not; fitted prom dresses in general run a size smaller than regular clothes.)  Dress shipped quickly.  If all this seller's dresses are as nice as this one; I would recommend their site to everyone!",5
676294,"I read the reviews about this product shrinking, but what I didn't realize is that is shrinks vertically, but not around your legs or stomach.  So the shirt is short and really wide, and the pants are short and baggy.  I would not buy this product unless you're OK with that.",3
526820,Nice pants. Fit a bit off. Inseam too long which brought the waste well above the navel on me but fit my taller sibling just fine. I am 55 she is 57they felt a bit narrow in the hips so if you have a bit more in the hips order up. They remind me of my favorite slacks from the 90s nice retro flair. I think they are great for a taller person with slim upper legs.,4

144902,This is a great lightweight wallet.  I have approx. 10 cards plus a Victorinox Swisscard tool in it & it still has room for more cards.  There is a divided section where you can keep your cash & receipts separately.  It's super light especially compared to the previous trifold Velcro wallet I was using.,5
584122,The design is very nice as well as the material but the card slots on the left barely fit my credit cards and the ID slot on the right  barely fits my drivers license. The cash slot is ok besides the gaping hole in the bottom and the pockets between the card slots and cash slots are... disapointing.,3
832812,"This dress was great for a one time thing. My 14 month old wore it for a wedding and looked ADORABLE! the quality definitely is lacking a bit - The top fabric is thin and the bow fell off before we made it to the reception but overall it was great for the night! For that price, I really couldn't expect a whole ton more.",4

My old sets were starting to really wear out, so I got these to replace them. They were inexpensive too. I have to use a leather fanny pack because they don't have pockets, but that's not a deal breaker. I prefer my fanny pack nowadays anyway.

I will definitely buy these again.",5

I have been asked by a couple people where I got it. My daughter wears it everyday and loves it. I purchased this product at a discounted price in return for an honest review. I have recommended this product to friends.,4

I'm a marathon runner and I needed something that could last for several miles.  I can only wear one, my left foot did not require as much arch support as the right foot, so it caused pain to that foot, but when wearing just the right insert, life was good, if anyone needs a 10.5 insert for the left foot let me know.",5

I had this problem with the first pair i ordered so figure it may just be a faulty pair but the second pair did the same. I do not know if it is just the black pair, as the grey ones i got did not have this problem. If it was constructed a little better i could love these.",2

When it comes to hats, the lie results in pain, swearing, and ultimately a perfectly good hat smashed into a dumpster somewhere, probably stomped on on the way. At least for me. That one little quarter inch is a killer - headache, that is. This little baby kills those killer headaches. Hallelujah!!! Steam, stretch, steam, stretch, and VIOLA!

I have three now (one in each color offered).",4

They are awesome.  Seeing a picture actually sells the product.  The service was very prompt.  Shopping online is better than getting out in the 90 degree heat to shop in stores.  You will be pleased with the button snaps for the Switchflops.,5
753904,"Bought this coat as a replacement for one that I've had for years that needed to be retired. Am pleased with its fit. I am short, standing at 5'3"", have wide hips but a small bust. I generally have trouble finding things that will button properly while fitting well. This coat fits all areas. I can button it all the way down, and am not swimming up top. The waist cinching belt of course gives a nice shape so you're not just a black column. I'd buy it again.",4
278674,"Well, I got it today and tried it on. It's not that bad. You get what you paid for. The material is cheap but it looks expensive from a distance. I'm keeping it safe because I feel it might break or something, but it looks pretty good on me. I think the silver looks wierd, maybe I should have got the gold one. But anyway, overall its an average. The metal part that keeps the two glasses together look really plastic but its worth the money i guess!",3
772529,"The bottoms fit great, since I do have a nice size bottom! But the top is way too big! I am a 38DD and I ordered the XL! I still haven't worn it! I will have to take it to get it adjusted, so hopefully next summer I'll be able to wear it!",3

In fact, I didn't even use all the little pockets that were provided. I usually carry a lot of things in my bag but when I filled my HeShe bag, it wasn't bulky. Another good feature is that you can either hand-carry it or use it as a shoulder/crossover bag. I am satisfied with my purchase.",5

They were great.  Because of the great service I bought another pair 2 sizes up!  I usually wear at 2 or 3 and a size 7 fit like the picture.  I was hoping they'd be a little more baggy, but I am content with the fit.  They're a lot of fun.",5

I know its a batwing shirt but it just doesn't drape like the picture shows. I sent it back.",2

Definitely quite sheer, and there is some space in back and creates no back cleavage (which I like)",5
170476,"I like these pants overall, I wanted some inexpensive linen pants to lounge in and these fit the bill. The only thing I don't like about them is that after wearing them a while they stretch out and don't look as cute on, but as soon as you wash them they get their original shape back... so if you're going to wear them only 3-4 hours or don't mind them looking a bit ""saggy"",  these are perfect.",4

No scarfs no rubbing off of the paint or anything like that so far. And she's been wearing them for about a month now,often on. They fit as expected, and she hasn't complained about any pain or rubbing while wearing them thanks.

I am a Zumba Instructor and teaching so often can be hard on your feet and these offered extra support.  The only thing is that they wear out quickly.  The upper layer starts to separate from the bottom layer and they become unusable.  This happens too quickly and they are expensive.,4

It seems out of the 2 listed styles, the non halter dress has pockets. I'll definitely be ordering another color. Another person said you have to be busty to fill the dress out.

I am 230lbs so i bought a medium but it just does not fit right.",2

226061,I should have expected it to be a bit big because of my height. 5'2; 96 lbs. It is more of a formal skirt. The design is a flowery/viney/siwrly pattern so it makes it something you can't really wear casually. It is a bit loose at the waist. It fits but hangs off my hips a bit since I am skinny. It ends 5-6 inches above my ankles.,3

The tassels weren't as long as portrayed. Instead of being cut straight across they were cut in an arrow pointing down to my hoo-ha. The straps are another thing. They are not thick supportive straps like it shows here. They are detachable strings thinner than a bra strap.,3

529794,"I wear a medium but ordered a large for more comfort. The large became just right, so it actually runs smaller. The hoodie length from my shoulder was way too short, therefore I couldn't put the hoodie over my head. The material is on the cheaper side, and the white fluffy hoodie doesnt look anything like the picture. Also the white padded part doesnt go all the way down or around, its just on the hoodie. The zipper was a little flimsy...pull too hard and it might break.",2
838221,"Awesome dress. Very comfortable. Does not easily wrinkle. It fit just like I expected for the size I ordered based on their sizing chart. I normally wear an 8/10, ordered a size 12 and it is perfect. Goes with anything and is comfortable enough I don't mind wearing it all day.",5
543677,"It's heavy for warm climates, but so cute and versatile. I wear it as a short dress, with leggings, with shorts or as a swimsuit cover up. It dress up to go to a nice dinner and looks great with anything. I would love a shirt like this in a lighter material, but absolutely love this shirt either way. Perfect for beach/resort vacation!",5
333905,"This coat runs fairly small. I'm 5' 10"" and a size 10, I usually purchase XL coats so I can layer comfortably. I bought this coat in an XL and with just a single layer underneath it's snug, but wearable. I can't comfortably sit when it's zipped. However, it is very warm and durable. Great for the Chicago winter. The hood is very roomy and comfortable. I often find that hoods are thin and not very useful, but not here.",3
465529,Let me just start by saying I love wallflower jeans I have been wearing them for years they are great and cute for cheap. I ordered this pair in two different colors the aura and Katy style and they are not just different colors they fit completely different. One of the pairs is awesome and cute and fits perfectly while the other doesn't fit at all I can button and zip them but they are way to tight. Picture enclosed is copy of slip where they are the exact same jean just different color.,3
345536,"My wife purchased this thinking it was similar to the Bittersweet version, it's NOT!!! the hair tie didn't stay on the bracelet and when the tie fell off so did the bracelet. Very poor product, I've already lost one of the bracelets because I didn't realize it fell off again, UGH!!!",1
700970,"This satisfies my inner Louisiana girl. My old chain for my ID card broke, but this one is holding up great. It also hasn't turned my neck green, which is very common for me. The only con is that the little chains do get tied up in the Fleur De Lis once in a while, but it's super easy to get it untangled.",5
657795,"The bag came in a reasonable amount of time. My only complaint is that one of the rhinestones had fallen off. I kind of expect that, though, when there's a tag on the purse that says, ""Made In China"". Kind of funny when Montana West is so ""American"" and uses religious and American flag designs and junk. But I digress. I found a replacement rhinestone and glued it on with some heavy duty glue. It's a nice purse and the price is understandable. I just think I would prefer paying a bit more for something made in the United States.",4
424655,"Beautiful dress, but be warned, the sizing is on the small side. I think it is one of the older BCBG dresses before they started vanity sizing, so if you fit a size 2 in BCBG clothes from 5 years ago, this will be fine for you, but if you're a current size 2 it's better to buy this dress in a size 4 or even 6.",4
634759,"This dress was fine but it wasn't the fit type I was hoping for. I went with the reviews and ordered 2 sizes bigger and the dress fit, but I was hoping for a more casual t-shirt style, and this dress is meant to be fitted. If that is what you are looking for, then I recommend this because I like the material a lot. It was actually really good quality.",3
824067,"The shipping said it would take roughly a month to ship, but I got it in 2 weeks!  I got the hamburger bathing suit and it is HILARIOUS!  It has made so many people laugh at pool parties and vacations.  The material is shockingly nice, soft, and super stretchy.  The spandex in it is really great in the tush area :).  I would get this again and again - will buy more ... thank you!",5
58629,My husband had a couple of these so i just ordered two for my grandsons.  They are comfortable with the stretch and still look like great quality with the leather buckle.  My husband has been wearing his over a year with his casual jeans and it still looks new so I know the quality is great.  However I do recommend you buy a larger size than just based on the waist size.,5
155520,"My husband loved this wallet. The size and weight is perfect for him.  The only thing he would change is making the clasp that holds it closed a little more sturdy. If the wallet is dropped from when an inch above the counter/table/dresser, it pops open. I still recommend it though!",4
53872,"We bought this hat for our 6-month old daughter for a trip home to Hawaii and her first trip to the beach. It fit her perfectly and the adjustable drawstring allowed us to adjust it to just the right side for her head. The coverage is great. It keeps her entire face and shoulders shaded and protected. The material is nice. It is light and cool and dries easily. Most of all, she looks absolutely adorable in her little floppy hat! So cute!",4
198719,"Had to get an MRI for my back and I have a bunch of piercings. Bought these to put in my lip while I had the test and it worked great! Good strong quality and long enough for anyone. The front piece is a bit difficult to put back in, but once I got it the stud stayed put!",4
255989,"I liked the colors of this scarf a lot. The colors were perfect for fall and added just the right amount of fresh color to brighten up my wardrobe. However, I did decide to return this scarf. While the colors were great, I was disappointed that the scarf was not an actual blanket scarf, which is what I was looking for.",3
72092,The traction with these shoes is terrific. Last summer my son slipped and tripped in his regular crocs. No problems with these shoes. They won't make it beyond one summer with my active little boy wearing them every day. The white sole is permanently dirty - we should have chosen a different color.,4
186097,"I""m 70 and really wanted something pretty and warm.  The best surprise is being told by strangers how stylish I look wearing this sweater. This is not a cheaply made sweater, if your looking for something with style and made with pride, this is a sweater you will be proud to wear and own.",5
84957,I was in love with this sweater but it was smaller than what I was expecting.nit is very unique so I love that part. The zipper end was cutting me because  there was a sharp metal piece bent out. I found it and just bent it in and then it was better after that.,3
61702,"1 week pp Really helps with the discomfort and moving around the first day.  I wore them for 24 hours and experienced a rash on belly/thighs, the leg holes are extremely tight on me cutting off circulation completely. I was a size 6 (5'10"" 140#) prepregnancy and got a s/m. Only worn for 24 hours so far so hoping they stretch out more with use, or will save for after my 2-4 week appt/clearance.",3
616890,"PXS ordered the 4 in green and it fits. Maybe 2 would fit better. The green color is bright and lovely! My biggest beef with this shirt is the silly shoulder thing they did, which does not look nice as in the photo here. It just doesn't lay flat and makes my shoulders look 80s big. Returned.",3
683354,"fit well and is really light and airy. i wore it for halloween with cat ears and a tail and a belt in the middle so it was more form fitting. it worked great. since the sizing is in asian sizing, i sized up a little and the fit was what i wanted. 34 to 36 D bust, 29-30 W and 38 hips for reference",5
48211,"I like this belt. Bought it for a little nicer than casual wear (e.g. black jeans). Nicely made, attractive. I like the comfort and flexibility of the elastic weave.

One note: I wear a 34 and had to exchange it for a 36. I suppose it depends on how much you plan to stretch the belt. I could wear the 34 if I stretched the material but for me, it's more comfortable when not stretched that much, so I needed to order the larger size.",5
854789,"I ordered the bag for keeping non-confidential documents and note pads on the run, as I am constantly on the run.  The size of the pockets is generous and belt is adjustable for a secure fit around the waist.

One thing that I have to point out is that the material is probably not genuine leather, it feels like pleather.  For this price, I actually didn't expect it is real leather (and I don't want to care for real leather when it will get rained on).  So buyers please be aware.",5
52913,"This hat is kind of gigantic on our 1.5 year old, but the drawstring allows us to fit it to his head. The large brim is adorable and makes him look like a flower. We get such a kick putting this on our baby and watching him run around. I enjoy knowing his face and shoulders are protected. Also, you can crumple this up in the bottom of a bag and it comes out looking great!",5
291058,"Based on comments and photos she went with a smaller size, medium. She's 5 ft 3.5inch, bust 36g, waist 33 and 50 inch hips. Skirt fits perfect not to tight but it sits on the hips well but the tank top is too short and barely covers he bra properly",3
176827,Wow-I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the package- these earrings are more delicate looking than the picture and the color of the stones is gorgeous- all of the stones were intact and the large turquoise stone is the color of sleeping beauty turquoise.  I am wearing them as I am typing this review and they are surprisingly lightweight for their length-about 2 inches.  Well worth the money and there is a matching pendant available too.,5
864214,The quality of the bras are great. The best deal that I could find where I could get three bras that were zippers for that price. I will be having a breast augmentation soon so I need something that's convenient and easy to put on and I think these will work very well. I am not sure how well they wash. I will post any updates on the quality once I wash them. I especially like the fact that it has a material cover that goes over the end of the zippers so that they don't irritate your skin.,5
546612,"Bought these bottoms to go with my maternity bathing suit top.  They have been awesome all summer and I love them!  My only complaint is that the fabric is a BIT too thin, but I was only planning on getting one summer's use out of them-- and I'm pretty sure I'll be able to wear them next year, too.  Very happy.",4
659260,"When I saw these pants, I thought how cute! Not to mention they were a great price so I thought what do I have to lose. They look just like the pair shown, but run super small. I usually wear a medium and ordered a size up and they still looked like they could fit my 10 year old daughter. With that said they do stretch pretty well and I am able to wear them but I would have like them a little bigger. You really can't go wrong for the price!",4
784405,"Absolutely beautiful ring, very happy with it. Its a true color change Alexandrite, it changes from emerald green to a deep purple and is usually a dark turquoise in most light. Only slight negative is the band is very thin, but that also makes it very comfortable. It runs a little big so size down if you're in between sizes. The setting seems very secure, extremely happy with my new ring!",5
646808,Cool back pack I thought it would be small but I think its good for  highschool I was able to fit my binder and books and seems like really nice fabric I got the the coffeel color  cool you should get it if your are thinking about it,5
715678,"I absolutely ADORE these sunnies. Super cute, stylish and make a gorgeous statement with any outfit. I've always like the brand Quay Australia and I won't be surprised if I create quite the collection of sunnies from them. The only reason I gave 4 stars in stead of 5 is because I wish the case it comes in was a hard case to better protect them. Otherwise, LOVE!",4
439136,"I bought this ring and a Pink camo ring for my wife, which she loved. They came in way faster than We thought they would. The fit was perfect and they are very light weight.( to be expected from titanium). I will definitely order from these folks in the future.",5
598073,I love this necklace its super cute and great for a nerdy Harry Potter Fan like me. I like the long chain. The only bad this was after wearing it for a few days I did notice a ring around my neck so I would not recommend for daily wear. Otherwise great product.,4
436844,"The tights came in about two weeks, and I was pleasantly surprised. They fit wonderfully, sometimes I had to pull them up during the day, but all tights do that. The only major problem was how easily they rip. My nails were a bit too long and I gently scratched at my leg a bit and got several small holes. The tights are still holding up after five wears.",4
795225,It took a little over a month to get to me but it was definitely worth it! I love this bracelet and it feels like a lot better quality than what I was expecting. It is heavier so I know it's better quality too. I would recommend this bracelet to anyone,5
248617,"This product is a totally great idea. My husband never brings his reading glasses along when we go out. Especially when he needs them. But I ordered the wrong cover size. So, they will have to go back. Plus my husband has a otter box protecting his iphone. So he wouldn't be able to use this product. If you could make just the pocket that the glasses fits into and allow it to stick to anything. That would make it so all cell phone users can use it.",4
815797,"Looooveee this tank. Im 5'3 120lbs 34b and wear a size 3 in juniors tops, ordered a medium and it fits well! I think i would have been able to fit into a small too, because the shirt has alittle stretch to it, but i haven't put it in the dryer yet so it might shrink. Shipping was fast and the quality of the shirt is on point, no loose seems or anything. Great for the price",5
23167,"Outstanding product- easy to use and very durable. I have wide feet, and it is rare I find any footwear that fits me right off the shelf. This product eliminates that problem.

455088,"I like the design and the fabric is nice.  I am not exactly sure what it is.  It's not silk, and it has some weird name for the fabric.  Anyway, it fits REALLY big so you might consider going down a size from what you normally wear.",3
620562,Beautiful shirt but their sizing is way off.  I ordered a size 12 which should have been big on me but was so small that I could not even get it over my shoulders.  They refunded me the cost but I am very sad that it didn't fit.,5
98216,"These are wonderful.  I have pregnancy related varicose veins and I am wearing these tights daily to relieve my symptoms.  They are not as see through as some of the other reviewers led me to believe, though near the backside they are more see through and I do make sure I'm wearing them with either a skirt or longer tunic.  I may purchase a second pair so I have one set to wear while I'm washing the other.",5
84946,"I like this dress, it's really cute, but on me it's more of a shirt.

I'm 5ft8in, and I do have long legs. I tried it on and as I was walking around in it, it was riding up and up and up, so I would definitely suggest leggings underneath, or just wearing it as a shirt for the taller ladies.

Overall it seems like it's made well and for the price, you can't beat it.",4
694733,"I ordered XXL for a young to wear to a formal dinner. The color was  perfect, but for the fit it was too small. The lining underneath the dress was too short. I had to give this dress to another young lady going to the same dinner. You must order a size up in order to wear this dress if you have curves.",1
851085,"I just received my dress today. It IS ivory, definitely not white but probably not as dark as most would like. I took the boob things out right away and it made it look so much better. The picture it with an ivory bra on. I am a size 14 and bought a 14 and it fits like it was custom made. It is very long but for the price its really pretty and good quality.  I may get a sash to break up the color a bit.",5
285841,This is the one of the most beautiful dress I have purchased. The material is very soft. It is very comfortable to wear it. It fits perfectly on me. With this price I am surprised that I am the first one to write a review. The only drawback about is dress is that the material is a little thin. It is a little see through without a slip or leggings. Othwise I have to say that this is the best buy of a beautiful dress.,5
346095,"I took my GF to Vegas for her birthday this past Memorial Day weekend and purchased this tiara and a 'Birthday Girl' sash for her. She loved the gesture and the tiara itself. So did the employees at the pool/night clubs we visited...many free drinks were had!

This is the first time I've viewed a tiara as appropriate (*vomit*). After this trip, I can confirm that tiaras do seem to make heterosexual cisgender-identifying women feel special. Many sashes and tiaras were seen. If you love your girlfriend and you're ever in this rare position, I'd recommend doing the same.

Cheers!",5
98058,This is the most comfiest stylish sweat shirt. Yes it is a sweatshirt. The image gives the impression of a different sleeker shirt and as other comments posted...yes the buttons r  crooked but does not impair the overall look of the shirt. Would have given 5 stars if the image was like what u actually get....I would buy this again because it is so comfy to wear.,4
304159,"These bras arrived today and are beatiful in color, soft in material, well padded, and seem very well crafted. Many reviews stated that the bras run small so I purchased a XXL I generally wear a 38D.

So I'm dropping them in the mail tomorrow and ordering a smaller size now. I'll update once I have worn the correct size.",4

742800,"I thought this was camel color but when I received it, it looks more peachy. I am fair skin so it washes me out a little bit but under a blazer or sweater or with a scarf it will do. I usually wear a large and I ordered a large and it fits fine. For the price I decided to keep it.",3
97441,"The fabric was great quality, and not thin. It was thick, and fit well. Unfortunately I had to return it due to a small tear in the front middle of the garment. I do plan to order it again.

So I recomend that you DON'T bye this product unless you want to be very very disappointed",1

I can wear the shoe all day long and they are super comfortable. They are light colored so any dirt will be seen right away, but they are easy to clean compared to other shoes Ive had. Would definitely buy another pair in a different color.",5
681677,"The package arrived much more quickly than expected, which was nice. The dress is true to the picture and really is a pretty dainty little dress. It's definitely sheer however, so either wear white or nude undergarments or use as a swimsuit cover-up. The fabric is not the highest of quality, but it feels very light and is quite comfortable. I'm looking forward to wearing this in Hawaii on my honeymoon!",4

I have always worn XL in leggings and bought 2XL just in case but these leggings still looked like a child size. If you don't have any curves and are very slender these may fit you great. if you have a little meat on the bones, I would find a different brand. I wish I would have taken a pic before I packaged them up to send back.",3
51339,These support socks are worth the little extra we had to pay for them. Very high quality and expertly made. By far the most comfortable of the support socks we have tried.

602376,"Delivery time is very fast! I got it before the estimated time. The quality is good. And I got the one looks exactly like the picture. First I was considering whether the size will be too small for me,because my head is pretty big,but when I got the heat,the size is exactly what I want. I love it.",5
96249,"I received a great deal of good feedback about this dress.  This dress has a modest cut but is still quite body-conscious.  The slit in the back was a little high for my tastes, but with a slip this is less of a concern.  I ordered a size larger after reading reviews and that worked out well.  If you have wide hips and a average waist, definitely buy this dress, but you may get more attention than you bargained for.",5
354121,Delivered as promised. Even has the etching on the sides which I like. My only complaints is that I wish it could be adjusted smaller. It's a little bit big and it swivels around my wrist. If you have tiny wrists i wouldn't recommend. It still gets the job done thiugh,3
465805,"I've been a sock head for years. Once I discovered this brand I was immediately addicted. The designs are awesome, the fit is great, and they are well made. I have about 12 pairs from this brand and will continue to buy more. I've been wearing these for a little over a year and they wash very well.",5
116439,"Well maybe not never depends on the color I guess. The white is too thin and see through, I bought this for casual days at work but I will have to wear a camisole underneath. The sleeves are a little to long and the top is longer than expected and tight around my hips.",1
444942,"I wanted a ring to match my beautiful bracelet and found this on Amazon. The ring fits just right although the stone seems enormous on my finger. The color of the stone is more green than blue but is pretty just the same and for the price, it's worth keeping.",5
334223,"These belts are the most amazing belts that I have ever owned. I had seen them when I was in the military. A friend was given on for his utility belt by a Russian soldier while on Shore Patrol. It amazed me to see them in production and you selling them. Tis a great, easy to use belt buckle. Thanks you.",5
486386,I'm a big him fan and had a watch just like this in middle school and it was my favorite thing ever. I was excited to see the exact same watch for sale at such a good price.(I think I paid like 40 for mine as a kid) it came so much sooner than expected my only problem is it didn't come in working condition..i Dunno if its broken or just needs batteries..witch is a bummer..if the watch doesn't actually work ill still wear it cuz it looks awesome...just lame to wear broken watch..,3
107324,"I loved these ! I got a lot of compliments on them as well. The only downfall is if you leave them in to long, it'll hurt when you try to take it out because it makes a little indent hole on the spot it was in. Other than that, it's awesome !",4
94819,I used it on a shirt and on my skin. It dried on the shirt a little lighter than what I was expecting but it still looked really good and worked great on my skin! I will warn you though it will stain your skin!! The next day I still looked zombie-Esk but I didn't mind.,4
698653,"The fit is very off, and the sweater that is sown over the plaid pieces is extremely short and Tiny looking( looks like a child's sweater) ... Looks nothing like the picture! I'm sorry but that's pretty terrible if what is given to the customer is not similar to what is shown",1
548245,"The fabric is great quality. Unfortunately the legs are a bit long on me, but seeing as I'm 5'0 most pants and leggings fit that way. I'm also not a fan of the high-waist but if that's your thing than it would be fine. The print on these is very clear which is often a problem on cheap leggings. Overall these are nicer than I thought they would be.",5
307330,"Literally the only shorts you will ever need. Cool, comfortable, and the stretch fabric keeps you comfortable after a you burg out hard and slam a pibber.

They wear like iron and look awesome.

The only issue I have is that the inside of left pocket is a white color, and it gets discolored after long use.

BUY 'EM.",5
241494,This is the second ring I purchased. The first one was too big. The return process was very simple and quick. I could not be happier with my purchase now that it fits! I bought this as a thumb ring and it is the only ring that I've found that is rounded on the ends so it makes it extremely comfortable and doesn't cut into my finger like my other rings have in the past. Highly recommend giving this item a try. My wedding ring is white gold and this ring is very similar in color.,5
133105,Bought these earrings for my step daughters 15th birthday. They are lovely small diamonds. The only negative I have on these is they don't provide you with real backs (its a plastic backing) instead of getting the typical white gold backings I would expect to receive. I do like these earrings. Just surprised to see the plastic backs. I'd buy these again. I thought they were a good price for what you get.,4
334833,"I am not fat by any means, but I ordered a large and I have a 32 inch waist and it fit my waist, but it had no ass or leg space.  If you want to buy this order at least 2 sizes bigger than you would normally wear also if you have any leg muscles good luck fitting.",1
639672,"Be careful, and take your body shape into account before purchasing. You can either have your junk in the pouch, or your ass crack covered, but not both. Some might be able to pull it off, but I would imagine they would be in the minority. The maker really needs to sew the pouch WAY higher up.",2
89726,"the fit is a little tight, but works. I'm a bit concerned about the thickness of the material used to make the case; it might get crushed. I need to protect my sunglasses in my backpack while skiing and the side stems tend to break off. I think these cases will do the trick, but I will have to go through a ski season to determine that.",4
303538,"Love, love, love this bag! I'm always traveling with multiple cosmetic bags because one is never enough. this bag will be perfect for all my needs because it has separate compartments that are quite spacious. I'm extremely impressed with the detailed stitching and the fun zippers. I plan to purchase more of these as gifts to other women who travel a lot.",5
54357,"Five Stars! Great Cigarette case, get it while it lasts and you won't regret it. Sturdy and tough yet elegant and classic, the finish is smooth and the engraved decoration feels good. Thinner than most cases thus slim enough to not feel bulging in your pocket. Initially received a wrong case but the customer service Steve was able to help me receive the correct one. Great customer service definitely buy again in the future.",5
784938,"This was a very pretty dress and the price is great for the costume we needed the dress for, but the zipper would not zip past the part of the dress where the bodice connected to the skirt. Even when the dress was not on my daughter it would not zip.",1
124941,"These are really cute- not sure what happened to those who received glasses ""not shaped like a heart"" but mine are just fine! If the hearts were a LITTLE bit bigger, they'd be perfect. But they're very cute overall, come w a protective bag & I received mine 3 days before shipping was even expected! Great value overall!",4
478466,"I ordered my regular size but they felt about half a size too big.

They are very cute, but noisy. All of the straps have metal rings on them and you definitely jingle as you walk. Between the size and the noise, I sent them back for a refund - and you do pay for return shipping.",2
671109,"The material is a very weird shiny material. I may be okay with that if it was the right size, but I don't feel like returning so I may just sell it. The print is spot on, the fabric is just this weird almost plastic feeling in your hands. I should have looked at the materials first before buying, I think it'd be perfect if it were cotton instead.",3
45359,"Because I have lost weight, my rings are loose even on my largest finger.  The Ring Snuggies work great.  I have a ring that is .375 inches wide and this set actually contained a Ring Snuggie that fit perfectly on it and the Ring Snuggie was pliable enough to get on with ease.",5
223502,"When ordering from companies like Allegra K, I know I canot set my standards too high. I know their dresses will be shirts on me and prepare for that when I order. I bought the navy and loved it so much I bought the pink. The fit is great and I cinch it with a belt. Cheaply made so not the best fabric but what do you expect?",5
714045,"This suit was amazing.  Wore it for a friend's wedding where I was Best Man.  It's a slim fit, so if you prefer baggy suits or are on the heavy side, this style won't work for you.  But if you're thin to average build, just order the suit with the proper measurements and it should fit fine.  I was pretty pleased, as the waist, chest, and arms seemed just as expected.  If course you have to hem the legs, but that's normal.

For the inexpensive price, you can't beat this suit (it almost looks tailored).",5
297590,"SO much better quality than the other veils I saw online. I would've paid twice as much, but I didn't have to! It looks and  feels like more of a chiffon instead of toole. The ivory is a true ivory, and the comb is plastic, very sturdy and hold in place perfectly. The weight is slightly heavier, so the fall is pretty and not wrinkled. SO happy to wear it for our wedding!",5
335163,"I really like the style of this suit but during the first wear the underwire popped out! It has not soft edge on the ends to prevent it and dug into me immediately. I'm going to do my best to fix it myself and wrap the ends in electrical tape, stuff them back in and sew them shut.",2
69207,"I purchased this for my daughter's Baptism. The dress is very pretty, however; there was A LOT of loose beadwork on it. One strand on the bodice was not attached to the dress. Rather than go through the hassle of returning it, I will try to fix it. I am concerned about it being too fragile to make it through the church service and reception that we are holding after the service.",3
120951,We got the turtle one and it's super duper cute. I love the ear flap style hats. My son is 2 and has a big head but the 2T-4T is still quite large on him. Of course I expected it to be since he's at the bottom of the age range.,5
479046,"Simple beanie. Got the Neon green. While still bright, I pictured an ear searing green from the picture. Fits good. The one negative, when i got the hat is smelled really strongly of musk/mildew. Yuck. Washed it and let it air dry two times, and now that smell is gone. No issued with color bleeding or shrinking.",3
294294,"I ordered these leggings in a 3XL in case they were a bit small, and as it turns out they are; I tried them on to find that on me in that size they barely go past my butt. However, I love them so much because of their softness (even though I have to constantly pull them up) that I'm willing to overlook that. They arrived within 4 days of ordering in perfect condition, although they're about 1-2 sizes too small. Another reason I'm willing to overlook that problem is I bought them to wear under some ripped jeans.",3
649128,"The suit was really nice in colors and the pattern was what I expected like the picture. Only complaint I have is I got a size bigger thinking it would come a little small, but I wish I had gotten my actual size instead cause it seems it sizes are correct and if you wear a large get a large. Plus it don't have pads but I just took the pads from an old suit n used them.",4
347050,Amazing dress for the price!!! Love Love Love it!!! The dress fits to size!! I ordered a large. I love that the straps was adjustable for my big boobs to stay up!!! I have no complaints!! I was def a show stopper at the wedding I attended!! I recommend this dress for all women with a big butt and small waist!!! Yes it will fit!!!,5
162696,I absolutely LOVE this dress. This dress came in the mail earlier than expected which was awesome since I'm not a very patient person. At first I thought it would be too long for me considering I am 4'9 but fits just right and the length is right above my knee. This was worth purchasing and good quality for a cheap price!,5
379669,I loved them the only problem is they are really big :(  I have a pretty big head too and they fall right off when I would look down.... they are really nice and great quality I just wish I could have made them tighter :(  had to send them back...,4
304251,"A decent quality cap that fits snuggly with an elastic band.

My husband always has a time finding these style caps that fit his head. This fits well as the elastic gives a personal fit for whatever size head it is placed on.

This is faux leather, however, it looks like the real deal.

Over all a decent cap with a great fit.

I was selected to review this product at a discount. My reviews are based on two aspects which are quality and preformance. My reviews are never manipulated or compensated.",4
570107,Is this from the official merchandising? If so.... after all these stanning years Im wondering if she ever reviewed how this was made... it looks so cheap and run too small :(. Finally got it after all these years and Im disappointed. I think I will keep using my The-fame and ARTPOP shirt. Sorry BTW!,1
149667,"I was a bit nervous about these. I weigh 145 pounds, and when I took them out of the package, they looked like they would fit a 10 year-old. I was pleasantly surprised when I was able to get them on (and off!) without having a stroke. They are a little bit long, but that's much better than being too short!",5
679454,I love the look of this dress... In the picture.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  When it arrived I order my size and I was swimming in it... The picture is not the same dress.  The model in the picture is super petite and I am too but this dress was way too much dress for my body it was well made and pretty but just would not fit at all ... Very bulky,2

I tried to wear it with both straps off but no support at all, so that didn't work. So disappointed. It also had a lot of loose threads around the seams. The fit was fine, quality not so much.",1

497582,"I LOVE THIS BAG
its huge
the material does not look cheap
i have the pink one and its a great color (although a little bit darker than the photo)
SO MUCH SPACE FOR THINGS
things can get lost in there however and it can be a bit of a hassle to have to dig through everything to find what you're looking for. i guess that comes with every large bag though",5
502071,received dress was impressed with quality of fabric and detail.  dress was shorter than I expected and preferred. also tight in the bodice. request to return dress but shipping was about 50% of cost of dress.  Did not realize I was requesting dress from oversea. I only like shopping in US.  Store would only refund 50% of dress cost or $20 on shipping.  Decided to take a loss and keep the dress.,4
241511,"The picture makes this ring look very light silver.  Once received, we noticed it was very dark, almost charcoal in color.  Not the color we expected.  For the money, it would make a great ring row wear while traveling abroad.  It's heavy and feels nice, just not at all the color we were going for.",2
35902,"Got this for my 6 year old daughter.  If she used it strictly as an umbrella,  I am sure it would have held up nicely, but it being a cane like shape, my daughter was dancing with it and the metal stem bent easily and snapped right off at the handle without much force.",2
670923,"Fabric was not what I expected!  Fit was about 11/2 sized to large.  Photo showed vibrant colors - this is drab and washed out in appearance!
Since I can sew, I will alter the arms and body of the tunic; will use it for grocery shopping instead of more dressy occasions.  I would lose too much money by returning to company.  I am surprised with the quality, since other tops I purchased from Collections Etc. were spot on!",2
819527,"Great swimsuit!!! If you have a large bust and are curvy this swimsuit is for you. I'm normally a size 12 and 36 DD up top the size chart was exactly right. The top has great lift but not too much padding, which is fine if you have a large bust. This suit covers all the curves and still looks great, without leaving you picking a wedgie. Highly recommend!",5
129966,"Be aware this product is basically a glorified sweatshirt with buttons. The picture clearly shows a twill type texture with the sharp shouldered and stiff collared standing shape of a jacket, but in actuality its just a floppy sweathood which makes the buttons seem gaudy instead of befitting of it's design.
If it didn't take so long to ship, I would likely send back.",2
87831,"This is the second time I have bought these pouches because they shrink after washing and I have lost a few. I do love this things and use them not only for cleaning and carring my glasses but have also used them to protect my iPhone and iPods.

Update: Well it took 48 years but I am now prescribed glasses for every day wear and I am very glad I have these on hand because they do a superb job of protecting my glasses as well as cleaning them.",5
391676,I absolutely LOVE this.  I bought two and both of them exceeded my expectations!!!! They are so soft and the fit is exactly as ordered!!!!  Im thinking I might buy a couple more.  What I wear to bed is soooo important to me.  Im all about texture.  These night shirts are the BOMB!!!!!,5
1533,I read other reviews that these hats run on the large side so I ordered the next size down. It was too small and I should've ordered the standard size. I was able to stretch it out with some water and a small bucket and it fits fine now. It is a great hat!,4
786093,"Very thin see through material. I ordered an XL. The bust area was SO small. Was not made for someone like me with a 36D bra size. Did not cover my bust at all. There was enough material there for someone who wears A maybe B cup. Other than than that, it fit okay.",1
647666,"Really cute dress; was surprised by the quality of the material. My biggest issue with the dress was that the side cutouts were different sizes and hit at different levels on your sides; so it looked a little bit wonky. Other than that it's really cute and due to the tighter nature tended to ride up a little bit whilst walking. I'm 5'2'', 100lbs, with a 32DDD chest and the top part fit perfectly but did fall a little low. I ended up tying up the straps together to hold it up while at a family function.",4
707069,i ordered these for a pub crawl we do every year as a charity event.  These were a huge hit.  Most onesies have the feet attached which make it hard to wear shoes with.  These are very well made and nice and soft and comfortable.  I washed in cold and dried them on low and they did not shrink and kept their shape.  Very pleased with the quality.  We ordered a few in different colors and we all loved them.,5
503025,"I was excited to get this because I love the vertical striping, hard to find and it is so slimming. I ordered the XXL size because I'm pretty chesty (a good thing). But this was very tight on me. Maybe when I lose some weight this will fit nicely but for the sizing that I ordered I expected a little more room. Maybe this is more for young ladies and not ""women"" sizing? It is still a very nice tankini top.",4
317313,"The suit is cute there is no doubt- but it certainly runs on the smaller side. I feel as though the top fits very funny as well- not enough support I suppose.

If you do decide to purchase, buy a size up. Also, shipping take quite awhile- I also did not like that I couldn't track the package.",2
506306,"Made from the softest stuff, girls in my camp at Burning Man couldn't stop stroking it! Super light and very breathable, kept me very cool even in +100 desert weather, and warm enough during long walks in cold desert nights.

361640,This was the best I could find.  The sleeve for the passport is larger than post others.  Even those which cost significantly more.  It has more sleeves for credit cards than you will need when traveling....but I guess that is okay.  The outside sleeve holds your plane ticket for easy access.,4
123355,I purchased this cute purse and had it sent to my 15 month old granddaughter.  My daughter said it is very well made and her daughter loves it!  She  also said it is a nice size and should be fine for her to use up to age 4 or 5.,5
638088,"Very cute and colorful for a six year-old who is thrilled with it. I like that she can see well through the plastic when she is using it. That said, I am sure it is on par with other plastic umbrellas. They don't last forever, are inexpensive, and like gloves, tend to get lost!",4
205152,"These are really nice and look a lot more expensive then they r. Only issue is the jewel is precariously placed. Ill prob add nail polish to make sure it don't fall out.
 I made the mistake of putting these in my pocket and the jewel came out of the slot. Easy to put back in. Just makes me nervous about it falling back out.

The material is advertised as 100% cotton and it does feel pleasant on the skin and touch. The shirt has a very thin material, so be wary if you are going to wear it in places that are heavily air-conditioned as you will freeze. Otherwise your body will breathe easily and the shirt will allow others to admire your hard work.

P.S. The shirt has been offered at a highly discounted price for the opportunity of giving an unbiased review.",5

646998,"The product fits somewhat small so buy a size up. Otherwise, the shirts are fantasic basics than can be dressed up or down. I love the elbow sleeves because they can be worn year round depending on weather. They are a great staple in my closet. The material is a bit clingy so if you don't want a fitted look, buy two sizes up at least or look at other offerings.",4

The product itself is okay but makes my face feel itchy. This is somewhat expected.",3

Just a warning for some! When it say it's a 16"" chain and 1"" pendant, the "" stands for CM. I accidentally read it as inches, but realized my mistake when I received it. Although it is smaller than I expected, it's a really great gift for friends/family/mate.",5

It looks and feels plastic and thin. I took it out of the bag and it had a heavy chemical smell. I let it air out for a couple of days, but it still smelled awful! Finally put it back in the bag and the smell faded from my room after another two days. Will definitely be returning this.",2

I was heavily made fun of for having a ""granny"" hat. It was worth the comments for not having to suffer from sundurn. The hat held up great even after dropping it in the ocean. It held up, dried quickly,  and didn't lose its shape.",4
723586,I received this hand bag at a discounted rate from reveiwkick.  The purse is very nice . I really like the style.  It has a short handle and it come with a longer strap as well.  The only thing I don 't like is the tassel in the front is backwards and it made from some kind of rope when the rest of the purse is leather. But fir the most part it a nice trendy bag great for any occasion.,4
403662,I received my purse a few weeks ago and I love it! The bronze finish on the metal components makes it very versatile. It's a big tote but not monstruous.

The shirt is more like a see through tshirt than the way it does in this picture.",1

The embroidery is beautiful. The only thing I would like to see changed with this item is to have thicker pants. All in all I am pleased with my order and happy with the price!,4
51206,"This was kind of a waste of money.. It fit like expected (I'm 5'7 150 lbs pre pregnancy.. ordered a medium.)

It folds under your clothes when you sit, just a waste of money.",3

45556,they should have the sizes correctly posted ...this was ordered in understanding it was bigger size next up from the newborn when received it was newborn....fits son ok for now but won't last long like I hoped and they cant exchange would have to order new one then return this size...to much work to do when son needs something now,3
830607,"Very nice material and we'll made.  The sizing is way too small for a cover up. I ordered an XL, I am 5'8"" and weigh 135 lbs,  well proportioned.  This will fit me, but it only comes to hip level and barley fits around.  Fits me nothing like the picture. If you are about 5'2"" and weigh about 90 lbs, an XL Will fit you like the girl in the picture.",3
544805,"Ok, I love love love this hat.  First I bought the black one,  I received so many compliments that I decided to buy the blue.  Best thing is that anyone can wear them.  My bf grabs them especially when we're heading out to the beach.  And he gets compliments when wearing them too.
The fit is adjustable and will fit anyone.",5
397214,"I have to set the record straight for this product. I received the ring in perfect condition, in the correct size, and with 950 platinum stamped on the inside. Very happy with the purchase. I would suggest other customers properly check their ring sizes for comfort fit in a jewelry store, even a local Walmart will work, before ordering online at Amazon so they have no sizing problems.",5
639562,"I was so disappointed with this dress. First of all I only realized it was shipping from China after my order was placed. That's when I realized it may be a little too small when I got it. I'm also a size small and by reading other ratings I knew I was to order a size up. I did. But it was still waaaaayyyyy small. The only consolation is that it fits my very petite, size 0, 15yo daughter. Hence my 2 star rating.",2
106051,"Love this dress it fit me pretty well, it was a bit short on me but I have a big booty and thick legs. I'm 5'3 and pear shaped, I've lost weight also I was 179 in that picture I'm 165 now I bought the lg. So for short thick girls this could work on us too. Planning on wearing this often this winter might add some material to edge of the skirt though out of personal appeal.",5
462883,"Just received this ring today and absolutely love it. I ordered a size 11 and it fits perfectly. The garnet and diamond boarder sparkle in the sun. It is also good to see that this item is made in the good old USA and not some other country. It has a nice weight to it also. Can't wait to show it off to my friends. Very happy with the purchase, will recommend this item to my friends.",5
635688,"Love this shirt!!! After reading the reviews about it running small I ordered 2 sizes up and it fits perfectly. The material is really nice, I can dress it up with a nice necklace and heels or wear it with sweatpants. I bought 3 more! I normally wear M/L so I got a 2X. So glad I did!",5
777167,This is a very comfortable and flattering dress. I wear it with a bold colored little sweater on top. I usually use my coral one but I also have a bright blue one I use. Find a matching set of shoes and wow! It is also very flattering. I have big hips but the pattern doesn't enhance them even more which I was worried about. It's made well and has held up with about 15 washes already.,5
726224,this jacket is a waste of money. if you want to return it prepare to spend 40 dollars to ship it back to china. i am very upset that I'm stuck with this ugly horrible jacket. it does not fit as described and is very very cheap looking. i will not and would not ever buy from this vendor again.,1
217202,"fits my big head well.  lined with black.  good construction.  much wider than i thought, would have been nice to see a pic of a model wearing it, so don't bother trying to sit in a chair with a back higher than your shoulders.  but it will definitely keep the sun off your head and shoulders.",4
651150,Bought this a couple of months back for my granddaughter. First one came with a broken handle. they replaced it no problem. It has been sitting in our attic for a couple of months waiting for our Disney trip. My son was carrying it in from the car and the handle broke on this one too. I get much better use from the ones at Bed Bath and Beyond and they only cost me around $70.00.,1
477351,"These pajamas are cute.  However, unlike all the other Leveret pajamas we have, the cuffs on the sleeves and pant legs are sewn with non-stretchy thread.  So they are really hard to get on, especially the pants which have to go over the heels.  So now I only put these on my son when all his other pajamas are in the wash.",2
116712,"My twins are 20 months and in the 50-70 percentile and I bought a size 4.... It is somewhat big but since the fabric is stretchable its looks fine. I think it will fit them for a year or so, which is great. So far looks great after 3 or so washes. Will be buying more of these in the future.",5
598460,"My hubby and inpurchased this dress for a ball. Was a little skeptical but what the heck!  When it arrived and I decided to try it on....OMG! I wasn't expecting to see what i was expecting! Im 5""2 130 pounds...ordered a size 4 and it fit PERFECTLY! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",5
54967,Theres not a whole that they could mess up with a mouse mask. One thing to note is that it is child sized and significantly too small for an adult Australian man's face. The head band that wraps around the face is kinda uncomfortable but not too bad. Its alright.,4
763549,"The shirt itself is lovely, but the size I selected (6) ended up being too large for me, and the sleeves were too short. I would gladly exchange it for a smaller size, but the sleeves would be even shorter. The only other facet of the shirt that I did not particularly care for was that the crochet portion dangled at the ends. It looked lovely on the ladies who displayed pictures in the reviews, and the quality was not bad at all for the price. It just didn't fit me right.",4
80002,"This is a great deal for socks, but I was disappointed with the variety (or lack there of) that they sent me. Three of my pairs were the same design in the same color and I had two sets of doubles, as well, in the 12 pairs. Also, the majority of the designs were mainly pink so now I have 8 pairs of pink socks! I really don't need that many pink socks, which is why I ordered a variety pack.",2
665858,"Was not impressed with the level of quality.  Should have been priced at $15 vs. the $30ish spent.  Used at the beach but couldn't fit more than two towels and a couple of items in the outside pocket.  If you have kids and need to take several items to the beach like me, look for something bigger.",3
147786,"I love this ring. Bought it as a wedding band That I wouldnt have to worry about to go with my engagement ring, or wear just the band in more physical activities, like cleaning or sports. It fits perfect and I cant even tell it is there. It is a slightly different color than my white gold engagement ring, but it is barely noticeable and I like the slight difference.",5
224001,"Swim skirt bottom fits well. My only complaint is that most fluffy people are curvy below the waist and this skirt is cut less flaired than most causing some skirt ride up issues. Not a huge deal, but thought I'd throw out a warning if you're  thicker in the hips or thighs.",4
604615,"The socks are great, but I do think it's silly to charge so much for 1 pair of socks that hasn't been in style for 30 years. Ah well, at least they still make them. Don't know what I'd do for my 80s party with out them. Oh, but they are darker shade of purple than they appear, which I was happy about. Thank you!",4
237502,"This is wayyyy to long! It literally goes over my female parts and I have a regular size torso. It's also very cheaply made compared to their other corsets. I was let down because I ordered two corsets from them, excellent quality. But this one was the most expensive and it's the worst one. I returned.",1
706102,"This was a great coat for a good price! it heavy and warm.  I purchased this coat for my son who is about 5'2"", age 12, slim build.  I purchased a men's small.  He is in that in between stage where young boys and juniors.  He normally wears a size 20 in young kids.  This fit great and room to wear sweaters or other clothing under neath.",4
481409,"these are extremely nice hand warmers, very warm, but not bulky. Very well made, and an excellent value. I have another pair in charcoal, and will probably buy another color next winter! I ride my horse frequently, and used them all last winter, with excellent results. The reins didn't slip through them, and I was able to maintain my grip and stay warm!",5
115227,"Beautiful ring - sparkles wonderfully.  I couldn't find another like it online and counted the days until it arrived. :)

The delivery time was faster than expected; I was incredibly happy to receive it! There was a small sizing problem that was resolved quickly and to my satisfaction.  I highly recommend this product and am more than pleased.  Love my new ring!",5
355892,"I love this dress! I bought three size mediums and they fit me perfectly. I'm 5 feet tall and about 135 pounds. It's not too short on me, and it has the shiftiness that I want.  It's very comfortable, modest, and I get compliments all the time when I wear them. I bought the crimson, black, and black striped. I have got compliments on each one.",5
1402,This was exactly what I was looking for. My son had asked me to help him find a pretty but sturdy chain for a claddagh pendant he was giving his girlfriend for christmas. This was perfect. It's very strong and looks great. Shipped fast too. Best of all she loved it!,5
307358,"These shorts are great in every way.  Both my teenage son and my husband look good in this style of shorts.  They each own a few pairs in different colors.  I like the slight tapering at the bottom it is very flattering on all types of body.  Just an example, my husband wears a size 34 and my son a size 30.  I highly recommend these shorts.",5
75546,"I am very happy with these, I purchased just the black originally and it was so great, I got the white also. I don't have to worry about my belly showing from under my shirts and my pants stay on all day and down fall down. I had a lot of issues with shifts being a little too short for my belly sometimes and with my pants never staying up. I am so happy I found these.",5
519333,"The stones look like opals and are really pretty, but it is very sloppily made..  a lot of the stones are crooked in the settings which makes it look very cheap. I have a purple one like it and it looks much better even though I almost lost the biggest stone out of it.",3
236334,This shirt fits perfectly and is absolutely beautiful. It glows in the dark very brightly. Usually when I buy tanks online they feel starchy and shrink easily but this shirt is so soft and has a nice length to it (I'm tall and have a long torso and it falls nicely over the top of my pants) I have only good things to say about this shirt and I get tons of compliments. 5 stars for sure!,5
687772,"This is definitely not haute couture. The hem isn't quite perfectly even, and neither are some of the buttons. The fabric is shirt-thin. But I bought it as part of a costume for a country-themed ice skating/dance show and it will definitely do the trick for the price. It's very flowy so there's plenty of flexibility for kicks, splits and all other dance moves.",3
222005,"I usually buy carhartt or dickies. Carhartt has become too expensive, and the sizes are inconsistent since production has moved to various sites outside of the United States. Dickies have decent price points, but the sizing is inconsistent as well. I gave Red Kap a shot, and these have similar quality as the other brands mentioned. I do like the fit, and will look to buy more.",5
79849,"I ordered this for my sister as a gift and she loves it! This is a great substitute for ears that don't have piercings on various parts of the cartilage. Because it is a cuff, my sister changes the placement whenever she feels the need. If you don't want to go through the pain of getting your ear pierced, this is a great alternative. Just make sure you are not allergic to the metal used in this cuff.",5
783694,This is fantastic!  I keep my toiletries in it hanging on the back of the bathroom door all the time.  I place for everything and neatly out of the way but right there when I need it.  When we went on a trip I just closed the zippers and off we went.  It hung nicely on a hook at the hotel and once again everything was right there.,5
616370,"This necklace came out to be very beautiful and classy. The clasp was very strong and sturdy. I love the fact that this necklace has a long chain incase you want to wear it with a scoopneck dress or wear it short with a sweater. Overall, very well made product and reasonable price.",5
47767,"I am using this item since 2010 ... Its awesome ...It not only guard your ear from cold wind and breeze .. its also helps you to remain your hair style as it is....only thing is that .. some time its came off from ear if you are wearing it too long (That's y i gave 4 star)... also if you are wearing BIG ear ring then it will not stay at place :)....

its is my all time fev ear guard .... I always carry this in my purse....",4
375003,"First off, this thing is really tiny. I don't mean just small, I mean tiny, like a little kid would take this on vacation. It seems a bit flimsy, but seeing how small it is, I'll just use it as a weekend trip case. I'm not sure more than 2 days worth of clothes will fit in it. I'm guessing there are better options out there.",3
313174,"Do NOT buy this..its a hundred and ten piece kit and the box looks NOTHING like that.  try about half the size and i got i think sixty? pieces of jewellery in it? NOT the hundred and ten as promised, buy a different kit from a different seller unless you like getting cheap arse stuff and being ripped off",1
224942,I love this bag!  It's a perfect size and shape with just the right number of pockets.  The only thing I'm hesitant about is how long it will hold up since I use it as an everday bag.  But the price is reasonable enough that I can just buy another one when this one wears out.,4
779560,"I got the 180cm socks. They are definitely long. The knit is bulky as pictured, and the socks are accurately colored [as pictured]. it's more of a warm white than a bright white [more like the color of milk, I guess] but they are definitely still white and I can't wait to wear them with some of my planned fall kogal outfits.

I measured these and they are definitely as advertised. They also fit my size 11 [woman's] feet perfectly fine due to the stretchy nature of the sock.",5
333448,"Received these and they are very soft. The rise in front and back is higher than other toddler briefs. The elastic around the waist and leg openings is looser than other toddler briefs so if your little one has thin legs, this might be an issue with # 2s.  We did not receive the color pictured but my son still likes them.",4
505342,"Bought for my 9 y.o. granddaughter. She's a bit of a Tom-Boy, and these added just the right amount of ""girl""y for her. Sturdy, comfy, and she loves the zipper in the back. They look great with jeans. I sprayed them with a product that repels water, and these shoes have survived the Mass. weather. Snow, rain, and mud. She wants another pair next year.",5
546788,this I bought bigger then usuall and regreat it because it would have fit better in my original size. That is why I put fits as expected meaning that this shirt would be in regular sizes its gorgeous and doesn't show the parts of the body many of us don't want but is made fashionable and beautiful will buy again,5
32205,"These are awful!  Someone described them as harem pants!  Yes, for an elephant!  The legs are enormous!  THe  fabric started to ""pill"" after first wash.  I would be ashamed for my husband to wear these out to the mailbox!  They were cheap, but I have bought cheap before and been satisfied. However, these look cheap.  There is a difference. Cmon Hanes, really!",1
595109,"This is a perfect T-shirt for my elderly mother, who is referred to as ""The Queen"" by all who know her.  She likes to joke and laugh, so she enjoyed wearing it when she accompanied my husband to the dentist.  (The dentist enjoys visiting with my mother while he works on my husband).  The dentist chuckled at the T-shirt, and he and his staff said it made their day.",5
630008,"All of my gym shorts are Medium in varying styles.  I usually wear 31 waste size jeans.  I weigh 140 pounds and am 5'7.  After reading all the reviews on these I decided to take a chance and order the XXL.  Well, after putting these through the wash and dryer they fit perfectly.  Go figure.  They still might be slightly too large.  Probably could have gone with the large.  But,I do like them.  They are sturdy and well made.",4
599393,"Very cute and soft. The feet are a little large, but I would rather have them a little big than too small!
I was searching for something warm and comfortable to wear on camping trips, and it looked like this would fit the bill.
Even though this is listed as a juniors product, it fits me just fine. I am 5'2"", average build. I got a large and it is perfect!",5
256138,"Although I received it sooner than expected, I was sorely disappointed upon opening it.  The only resemblance to what is pictured is the color!  It barely reaches down to my knees (I'm 5'2"" tall) and is much too small.  It doesn't even come close to the measurements given in the description.",2
757280,"Got if for my mother for mothers day. She asked me what backwoods website i git it from. Obviously she hated it,my money was wasted and i had to buy her a another gift. Don't buy it. Just go get her a bag from-Ross,DD's, and finally MK if you've been a horrible child this year. Such a waste of money..",1
695829,"I bought this for my husband, since he is a huge Obama fan.
He receives compliments every time he wears it. This is a rare gem.
This is one gift he will treasure for a lifetime. The jacket is durable, and has awesome quality from thread to thread!
If you are a fan of Mr. Obama, or know someone who is...this makes a unique gift.",5
687696,It's cute and nice quality. It runs small though I ordered a size 8 but fit it to fit how I want it to I think I'd need a 12. I want it loose. The 8 guys really tight and the lining needs  to be 2 inches longer to cover my stomach. I'm sure a 10 would fit but most likely not as I want it to.,4
639510,"Wasn't to bad. I ordered a size up (I'm usually a medium and I got a large.) Fit my body from ribs down perfectly, however the chest area was really big and baggy. I had to tie the plunge part around my neck super tight in order to get it to fit appropriately. Overall I'm pretty happy",3
252106,These socks are much thinner than other brands I've bought. The only reason I bought them was because the item description says they are 80% merino wool but the back of the pack clearly says 71%. If I had known that I would have just bought the people sock brand that is 71% but is a much thicker sock and better quality.,1
55476,"The quality of the shoe leaves something to be desired. The toe of one shoe looked a little scraped during manufacture. Nothing I can't manage.
The shoes are a little narrow, but I normally try to buy wide sizes.
All in all, about what I expected. They are good enough for my tastes.",4
632640,LOVE this bathing suit! The tassels are a bit annoying they get tangled together while swimming. Other than that it's beautiful. I was worried it wasn't gonna fit but it fits perfectly. Over all this is my favorite bathing suit. I ordered two. One for me and one for a friend she loves hers just as much as I do. :),5
642954,"This thing looks cooler online that it does in person. It's fine in person but it's the size that doesn't look good--it's gigantic! I ended up returning it bc the round part is just too huge and looked odd. I love the design, the color metal, etc.. but double check the diameter of the actual circle to make sure you want something that large--it made it look cheap.",3
390969,Love the feel of this dress!  The top portion is rather sheer so I'm going to have a thin liner sewn in and have to have the hip are of the skirt portion taken in as I was sadly not blessed with curves.  Minor items considering that the price cannot be beat!!  My package arrived in good condition and earlier than expected.  I will definitely purchase from this vendor again!,4
217712,"Given the picture and description ""rainbow"" I was expecting bright colored gloves.  Instead I received 4 pairs of dark maroon, 2 brown, 2 charcoal, 1 black, 2 light grey and 1 pink.  Not what I wanted for my daughters ice skating party.  Also the gloves are adult size not kid size",2
432681,"I bought this petticoat to add some volume to my daughter's Halloween dress, and it did the job great. Made of good quality and I expect that it will last until she outgrows it. I also plan to use this for her Christmas dress, and any other dress that could use more oomph.",5
410219,I used this tutu for a Halloween costume and now it is displayed on a dress mannequin in my bedroom.  I bought turquoise and the color is just what I expected.  It doesn't cover my derrire like a ballet tutu does.  It is shorter and poofier.  I have been pleased with this purchase!,5
54100,Very good quality hat. Since the price was one of the cheapest on amazon I was not expecting much but I was pleasantly surprised. My son is only 3 months old but I bought him the larger hat because I'd rather he grow into it. Although it is very big looking on him the drawstring and the latches around the neck make it fit quite well. The material is very soft and it just looks very well made. I'm really happy with this purchase.,5
781175,"Looks great!  However, smells really, really terrible.  I bought 3 colors, black, red, and brown.  I have used many different methods to try and deodorize them, including backing soda, water, soap, vinegar, scented candles, and scented oils.  NOTHING WORKED.  They are unwearable.  The smell does not even smell natural either.  They can be smelled from a distance of up to 8 feet even.  The smell won't even leave my room.  Really disappointing because of how great they look.",2
115033,"This bracelet is absolutely perfect..From other comments I read that it is not long enough...However, my wrist is 17 cm I've clasped on the last ringlet of the lock and all the same the bracelet is very comfortably on a hand and even fits free on wrist..I will buy 2 more for my mom and sister...All badges are made very accurately and qualitatively. I am in love with this bracelet...Rope is not rough, so it doesn't irritate skin...It is very stylish and as badges have special meaning I know it will serve me as a mascot...Thank you",5
409477,"This is even more beautiful than the picture indicates. The size is carryable when full and fits nicely in an airplane overhead bin. The leather is beautful and the computer case is perfect for my 17"" HP laptop. If you overload the case the zipper separates. I have had it for a month of HEAVY use and it's holding up well. Worth the cost for something beautiful and functional I use several times a day.",5
698291,I LOVE this sweater. I ordered a size up cuz I knew if I ordered my regular size it wouldn't fit BUT it's wonderful & my friends & coworkers love it! The texture threw me off a bit but I figured as much since its shipped from Asia--if you're wondering its a silky kind of texture and thick enough for fall.,4
797790,"I ordered a size large. I'm a 36D, 9/10 in pants. The bottoms fit perfect, the top however was a bit small! :( No padding or anything in the too either. The material was very cheaply made and very thin as well. Almost too thin to wear as a bathing suit!",3
733109,"Very warm and attractive. The cord accidently caught on something and pulled all the way out of the hood. I attempted to get it back in - it's harder to do than most hoodies when that happens, because the cord is so wide. When I have enough time to mess with it, I'll fix it. Otherwise, I'm pleased with the jacket. It washed up nicely.",4
255001,"I say fits as expected because I was prepared for the fact that you have to order MUCH bigger than you normally would. I'm a size 14-16 depending on brands so I got the 5x and it fits beautiful, it actually quite adorable.  I may even have to wear this with a short black skirt when I go out! If your bigger than a 16 I'm not sure I'd recommend this though, I this I got the biggest size and it just fits.",5
83658,"Tried them on in a store before buying online so I knew they'd fit good. Overall I was looking for a durable cross training shoe that would hold up to my rigorous training and these have been great so far. They are really light and comfortable. Most importantly for me they have grips on the bottoms so my feet don't slide out from under me while doing planks, push-ups, etc. Highly satisfied with this purchase.",5
824100,"Very cute, but has a slightly pinkish tinge (not off-white like photos) and fits quite a bit tighter than what I expected, and I ordered up a size on instinct. I wanted more of a loose, thin sweater and this is more like a tightish night-shirt.  Arrived several days early!",4
27273,I bought these for my husband.  He is only 35 and works on his feet all day-really long days.  One day he started to complain how bad his feet hurt.  We made an appointment for a foot doctor but before we went to the appointment I bought him these to just try.  While he did say they helped-they didn't resolve the issue.  HOWEVER he does feel that these were just as good as the $545.00 custom pair from the foot doctor.  Worth a shot.,4
39388,"The sizing info says that a  36 to 38 waist is large and I agree .I wear 36 a comfortably ,but these are much bigger than a an old pair of xl by the same manufacturer. I guess the new medium is the old large?? Like everything else in clothing these days, depends on the country of origin!",3
36681,"my 6 yr old daughter asked for an umbrella for Christmas and this was a hit!  i love it because it ""bubbles"" down over her for more protection from the rain and she can still see where she's walking.  it's easy for her to put up and down.",5
613811,"These fit amazingly, I love them. 32 waist and ordered an xl like the chart said, definitely follow the sizing chart provided by the company. Because of my larger package I was afraid that they would push down or not hold everything all day but they had enough room and held everything nicely. The material is soft, stretchy, and breathable; they stay put and feel great. They look so sexy, will be ordering lots more!!!",5
631224,"Good quality shirt... for a 15.5 inch neck, the shirt is much to wide around the mid section.  Someone with a 15.5 inch neck should expect someone more fitted considering they are, on average, under 200 lbs.  The shirt, at that neck size, could probably accommodate someone well over 200 lbs.",3
879546,The shoes are super cool and my daughter got a lot of compliments on them when they are lit up. unfortunately one of the shoes will not hold a charge and I am returning them. I do plan on buying another pair for her upon receiving my refund in hopes that this is a fluke.,3
252519,"These shoes work wonders when playing. I pulled my hamstring using regular running shoes when playing badminton. Switching to these has made a world of a difference. They are a little uncomfortable and feel funny the first time but once you get used to them they are great. My hamstring does not hurt with these and they don't slip either. Makes them great for the quick back and forth, side to side movements needed for the sport.",5
222331,"For reference, I am 5'5"", 130lbs, with measurements 34-27-35.

The dress fit very well. The material is pretty much what you pay for - cotton used for costume designs. The lace on the bottom is awkward, where it doesn't fall nicely, but after one ironing it should look better. I bought a petticoat to make the A-line dress more dramatic, but the dress looks just fine without it.

Good purchase, modest yet cute design; don't buy any other Alice costume if you can fit into this one.",5
504608,"I got this a longgggg time ago but completely forgot to write a review. I got much bigger size as the suggestions from some of the reviews. It's still way too small. The bottom and middle parts were fine, but, it's too short!!!  It's so short that the bra part was around my upper stomach. No matter how hard I pulled, I couldn't make it fit. For reference, I'm 5'6"" and 115 lbs. I'm really sad because I think the style is nice. It just doesn't fit me.",1
829216,"The skirt was very pretty. The Fabric felt a little like costume fabric but it did the job. I actually ordered two, one for me and one for my daughter to wear matching outfits for Mothers Day. One of the sizes was wrong so they gave me a partial refund. It worked out fine because I was planning to alter it to a child size. I did appreciate their effort to help with the partial refund.",3
266062,"This outfit is incredibly cute, but the top is small small small.  My daughter is in the 80th percentile for height and weight, so I always order up.  Her first birthday is around the corner, but the 18M top fits her like spray paint.  So I ordered the 24M set.  I can't tell any difference.  I've never had this happen before with any brand.  The skirt is just the cutest, so we'll use a different shirt or onesie with it.",3

The posts were painfully thick for my ears holes! But it was well worth doing; I think they actually look better as ""danglies"" If you can't do it yourself, a jeweler can (inexpensively) do it while you wait.",5
134759,"I am really pleased with the quality of this pair of socks. They are snug enough of a fit to stay up all day without constantly tugging at them, yet don't cut off my circulation either. Perfect heighth at the knee, and soft. Arrived quickly with no problems what so ever.",5
124264,"I was a little worried purchasing this without trying on but someone's review really helped. I am 5' 6"" 160 pounds and am very conscience of my curves but this hits them and makes it stunning without over accentuating them. I can't wait to wear on my trip to Mexico it makes me feel gorgeous. I went with the size medium.",5
110562,"I received it in the mail actually a really good time. Took maybe 2 weeks but when i opened the package I expected something more, well, not so cheap looking. It's almost rusty looking. I didn't like it very much. The rose was yellow and not like in the picture and the chain was just flimsy. Not my taste but for the money at least it wasn't broken.",2
451644,I like the material of the bag. The colors are great - they go with anything - and the bag is light in weight. I like that interior with the single zip pocket and 2 inside open pockets. I haven't had the bad for very long but the bag seems well made.,5
167276,"I'm really impressed with these. I'm in love. I have them in three colors and ordered two more. I have Lulus, Nike, and other very expensive brands and these are just the best!!!. Great fabric and no pilling so far. Been trying to find them in Navy but they're are sold out in my size.
Will update review if necessary. ;)",5
871557,"So, im about 5'11 , 250lbs, kinda chubby (think jonah hill chubby) it fits very nice as i got a 3x. I would recommend that if you wear a 1x, get a 3x. If you wear a 2x, i wouldnt get it. It will fit very tight around the love handles.",5
657357,"Originally saw this dress on Pinterest, was spectical about ordering this dress on here not knowing if it would be a poor copy or not. Received the dress and i love it! Beautiful dress, fits well, a little tight on the bottom where the underskirt is visible, but I have wide hips and find that normal with fitted dresses. Color is vibrant, material nice and not see through. I can't wait to wear it out!",5
645251,HORRIBLE W A S T E of money . It is NOT what it looks like online it was a yucky color and the top was like are you serious ? It was like SOO loose no way to make it fit properly . The model is a horrible example of how this is supposed to flt and look.,1
113009,"I normally wear a 7 1/2, but after trying these on at Macy's, I got the 7 which is perfect. They look great and will go with all different kinds of outfits. Going to order in the gray too. I don't look good in the ballet flats and these are a great alternative. Heel is just the right height ! Only gave 4 stars because they're a bit stiff and need to be broken in",4
5008,I wear a size 38x34 in levis and the 38 carhartts fit me perfectly. These pants meet every single one of my expectations as a contractor that works on home repairs and maintenance all day long. I couldn't ask for anything more and the five pairs I own are all I ever wear to the job.,5
863671,"Fits well, wish you could order XL tops with M bottoms so I could buy more of their cute bikinis. But when I buy an XL top for my 34DDs the bottom is too big. This style is the closest to a decent fit as I can get to hold in the top and not cover too much bottom.",4
240891,"This was the perfect ring for what I needed. It's very comfortable to the point where you forget you even have it on yet it's slightly weighted so it feels durable, not cheap. It's super sleek and smooth and hasn't tarnished at all since I bought it 3 months ago. I ordered both the 3mm and 4mm because I didn't know which one I'd prefer and I ended up keeping both because I was so impressed with it, especially for the price. I would definitely recommend this ring to anyone.",5
696404,"I really like the shirt and the material isn't bad either; it actually is quite tough compared to other flimsy lace products. However, it is small around the torso. I had to constantly pull at the shirt and if you've got a muffin top, you'll have to wear a jacket on top always.",3
517639,"I have always has somewhat of a large ""front"" and uneven shoulders. Normal bras would fall off my lower shoulder constantly and I have never liked underwires although they usually have a better fit. These are pull over bras and fit comfortably. The triangular shaped insert keeps things smooth looking in the front. The only drawback is the insert moves around a bit so they need adjusting periodically. I will keep buying them.",5
166036,"I'm an avid gym go-er and weight lifter. I LOVE the quality of 90 degree's leggings. The colors are always so pretty. They have always passed the infamous squat test and are not see through. If they are for you, then you ordered them to small. I have quite a few pair that are over 2 years old and there are no signs of fraying or unraveling or anything. They have outlasted most of the Nike leggings that I have. These are my go to workout legging brand for sure!!",5
527928,"Not as cute as they seem online. The quality of the fabric is really cheap, but then again, so is the price. Ultimately, you get what you pay for. However, after trying them on once, I have never worn them but I did keep them ""just in case."" It seems like they would be a good addition to a Halloween costume or something, not to wear to the gym or for the heck of it. They just look too cheap.",2
625098,"This shirt is super cute. I saw people write that it was tight at bottom but that's what makes the shirt cute. I also saw someone write about the fabric, but I love the fabric! I wore this to a Valentine's Day Party and got compliments. I'm 180 and got a 2XL and it's now my favorite shirt.",5
27311,These were recommended by my podiatrist for my flat feet. It took a couple of days to get used to. I have been wearing a pair every weekend while working in the yard and they have helped relieve my pain in the left ankle where I have bone spurs and osteoarthritis. They have been a tremendous help. I just bought a second pair for my dress shoes that I will use when I am standing for long periods.,5
593768,"Its is a well made robe. Nice material. The leggy was perfect but the the shoulder width didn't fit a US size 54 coat. It fit a US size 48 very well maybe a 50 too.
The largest size is best suited for a person with a size 48-50 suit size.",5
419703,"This is a cute purse, it is small but fits enough things inside like a big purse. The only problem for me is that the chain is a little too short for me. When I put the purse on my shoulder it is to my stomach lol but other than that the purse is good :)",4
581728,"This is my second purchase. I initially purchased the red and black slouchy hats for my daughter who has been using them for a year now and she still loves them. I would only suggest you hand wash them. We washed ours in the washer and they shrunk and seemed to have lost their appeal, but they're still great.",5
357179,"My kids are in 4H and needed a white lab coat for showmanship.  This coat was perfect!  Exceptional quality for the price and fit true to size.  I had many parents at the show coming up to me asking where I got such a great coat for my kids!
I have already washed this coat on cold wash, and dried it using low dryer heat it did not shrink and was wrinkle free!  WIN, WIN, WIN for Mom!",5
825083,"This has a weird fit for me.  I am a size 8/medium and it does fit, but it is shorter and wider than my figure and the sleeves are significantly shorter so I have to role them up to 3/4 to make it look fine.  I wear it open to avoid the awkwardness of the shape on my body when buttoned.  This is not a good option for slender figures looking for something fitted but will work if keeping unbuttoned.",3

I'm not as happy with this as I have been with other purchased from the ""ours"" store simply because my legs aren't lonn and thin like the model. That said, overall I'm happy with this item and would probably order it again.",5
41391,"These YogaAddict Yoga Toeless Socks are awesome!  I have a couple of pairs of the more expensive Toesox brand, but prefer these because the material is less bulky between the toes and around the ankle.  The soles have amazing traction even after several washings, and I don't feel the rubberized nubbies under foot as I cruise between the students' mats at my studio.  These socks are a nice alternative to setting up yoga mats on both sides of the room while I am teaching.  Lovely and affordable product.",5
664709,"Love the PJs but order a size or two up. We already had several pairs of this brand so I knew to order them larger. I bought my 50"" inch son a size 10 and he honestly could have worn a 12. My 4 year old who is 43"" wears an 8 in these. His legs are shorter so they are a little long but because of the bottom, they stay in place. Too is just the right size.",5
870802,"It's just OK.  If you have any kind of boobs, they will not fit into the top.  There is simply a flat panel where the girls belong but no 'pocket' for them to rest in.  Thus the seam under the embroidery goes straight across the middle of the breasts.  So this is basically a smock type nightgown with no flattery or sexiness at all.  Straps are very thin and slip down my shoulders all the time.  Color is pretty.",2
145798,"This was the perfect size for my pockets. It fit my cards very well. I sued to have to fold my insurance card to fit, but this just worked well. Also, it's got lots of pockets which is always a plus
As for durability, well we'll see about that in a few weeks.",5
77329,"I read the reviews and thought for 20 bucks, got to give it a shot. I ordered my size and they fit great. They are softer than what I expected, which is great. I liked that they packaged the red and black separately. This sure beat buying one panty for 8-10 bucks a piece. Great buy!",5
34741,"Purse is just the right size and I like all the pockets.  If i were to make any changes it would be to have the
large pocket of the purse just a little larger and eliminate the pockets on one size.  Very convenient having the
cell phone pocket on the end of the purse.  I know what I want in a purse and its hard to find what I like, like this purse
a lot.",4
698858,"My six year old daughter is on the petite side.  her hands are probably a bit smaller than most other kids her age.  She is currently in size 6 Clothes though.

These gloves are huge on her hands (I got the size 3-4 gloves).  She will need time to grow into them, but in the mean time they aren't usable for her skating lessons.

I read a number of people saying these are tiny, however I can't see it.  Even though my kid is a bit smaller, these would not fit any of her kindergarten classmates well IMO",4
505239,I was a little worried that the one I bought wouldn't look as pretty as the one on display but I'm very happy to ralize how silly that was. The pendant and pyramid are wonderful and they arrived a week earlier then the date I was told! I am happy with my purchase and will be ordering more.,5
316611,"These stockings are very pretty and they fit well. The garter part will stretch out and they will sag at the thigh but I don't mind that personally because I like that the top shows, but if you're going for modestly these probably won't work for you. The quality is very good for the price.",5
712001,"Bought in Dec. as gift for my child.  I have had to sew the upper shoulder seams as well as a hole that appeared in the hood and shoulder-not on the seams. The zipper also started pulling away from the stitching on both sides, my child wears this probably way more than it was 'made' for. Gentle wash cold! Read the care instructions or it might get ruined, we have not had that type of problem yet. I bought it big on purpose, seems to be true to size. Fabric is nice, lets hope it holds together for Halloween!",4

Even my daughter who is 8 yrs old wears it and love it! So far the quality of the silver seems durable and well made.
I bought this item at a discount price for an honest review.",5
455791,I love this little belt.  It pulls the waist of my pants in enough so they don't fall and give me saggy butt.  Many times my pants will be large in the waist but not enough that I want to pay for altering.  This belt does the trick and lies flat under shirts.,5
644572,"Happy with the Dress, After contacting the seller, the Dress was received within two days.  Original date for delivery did not get here but seller quickly resolved the shipping delay with immediate shipping.  Dress looks just like picture. Very pretty for the price.  Size 10 fit as expected.  The bust is a little big.  My daughter is 5'9""  146lbs.  worried about the length but its perfect.  Very pleased with dress compared to what we had previously looked at in Bridal shops.  Would buy from seller again in the future.",4
445359,"The jacket is the BEST part of this costume.  The jacket has a nice stretch in the sleeves.  The button closures are flimsy though, which I had to reinforce with additional Velcro elastic.

The body suit:  horrible zipper, broke when zipping up the first time.  The tutu ruffle is bad - removed and sewn the rest of the suit to another black body suit.  Now looks great with the jacket.

Cute bow tie collar.

Forget the awful hat - bought another to complete my look.",3
271823,Terrible! All of the earrings were terribly made (prongs go all the way to the center) except for one single clear earring. One prong was even bent (see dark blue star in first photo). These are very cheaply made and obviously the seller has no quality control if this is the type of product they are allowing to be sent to their customers. I will be returning for a full refund.,1
346455,"These straps are pretty impressive for the price.  Heat sealed adjustment notches, solid buckle and hardware, soft and comfortable and bright colors.  Very fond of this brand and they're a really friendly seller.  Yes certain sizes and colors aren't prime but it's not a deal breaker.  Have purchased several of this brand and can recommend with no caveats.",5

It does run small- i'm 5'3"", 128 lbs and fit and i usually get size 4-6 in bathing suits but this one is a size 10 for me. For reference i had to return two bathing suits from the same maker in size 6 that were falling off me. So size up!",5
655539,This dress looked NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURES.  The fabric was cheap and there were very few crappy stones.  I added  a silver ribbon sash to dress it up a bit and to hide the awful sewing.  My daughter insisted on wearing it because she didn't have time to return it.  BUT - what a way to ruin a kids Homecoming!!  Its been 2 years and I'm still annoyed-  why is this site still around...what a rip off.,1
851504,I usually wear a small in shirt but the large fit like a small except that it scooped in so far at the arms I can't wear this for fear of flashing someone. There's another review here of the exact same tank where the cut looked a bit different. I'm wondering if this one is defective.,1
42988,"I was expecting frames like those shown in the image of the glasses.  The ones I received were all black.  As for the seeing part, they seem to work perfectly.  My only complaint is that if they are going to ship all black, they really should show the image as all black frames.",3
552613,"I really like the fabric and if that were the only consideration, I'd give these five starts.  The fit, however, is a bit off for me and I wish they had more of a engineered contour pouch like most other modern briefs have - especially in this price range.  Will give the two pairs I own a little more time before deciding whether to order more.",4
351106,"Cute print, and the quality of material / stitching is to be expected.  However, the bottom of the dress is totally unfinished...like it was cut with scissors then just shipped!

So while the hook maybe silver the chain wasn't.",5
553094,"I would love this product more if it fit me. I purchased a couple sizes larger because of the reviews that I have read where people have said it was too small.

Now I'm stuck having to pay for return shipping because of lousy reviews..",3

Worth the extra bucks to avoid the toy hat and go for the costume hat!",5

It is a very cute umbrella, and the bubble shape is perfect for younger children. I highly recommend finding a different brand, however, or your child will probably be very disappointed very soon.",2

296192,"The soles are thin and need more cushioning.  After wearing a few times they are adjusting to my feet, which is good.  Not leather, but unless closely inspected no one would know.  I have bunions and the toe box is narrow, so beware, but they are cute and I've had many compliments.",3
249341,The dress came the day it was expected and even arrived at an earlier time. The fit was perfect! I ordered am XL because i wanted it to fit loosely. It wasn't cut small so i could have got the Large and it still would have fit nice. The fabric and overall style of the dress was great and just as pictured. I used it to create a tooth fairy costume but I plan to buy the same dress in another color since it is so cute.,5
717448,"I was worried about buying this dress, cause when I ordered it there weren't any reviews. I was worried about the quality with it coming from china. But it ended up that I didn't have to worry about it at all. It was beautiful and really good quality, the only complaint i have is it is a little small but not enough to worry about.",4
143405,"I didn't realize how stretchy this shirt would be, it's similar to t-shirt material.  The sizing chart is accurate, I measured myself and ordered a size XL.  I wore it for a costume with a corset bodice over it and it worked perfectly!  It is very ruffly and has very puffy shoulders so it's not for everyone, but looks great with an underbust vest or wide belt and skirt over it.  Overall it's well made and I would recommend it if you like ruffles or need an affordable, comfortable shirt for a victorian costume.",5
266029,"The top of this set is nice.  I pair it with jumpers and other clothing to hide the ""Birthday Girl"" written on the front and get more use out of it.

The skirt is crap.  Don't expect to get any more wear out of it after the birthday party.",1
480178,"This is great for my size with a 25"" waist. If you waist is much larger, you will not be able to tie a full bow. It's a wrap around, so you have to wrap it around yourself and then tie the bow. The material is as described, faux leather so it does not breathe and I did get kind of sweaty around the waist when I wore it with a synthetic top. I got a lot of compliments on it.",4
140057,"Yes, the sweater runs small.  If you weigh over 165-170, it's not going to fit you.  And YES, it fits like a crop-top in the front because it is supposed to!!!  That is the current style and you wear a long shirt underneath it.  That is how it is supposed to be!  It is warm and wooly, and yes, the sleeves are 3/4 length.  If you want long sleeves, this isn't for you.  I'm very happy with the price and style and have had lots of compliments on it.",5
586482,"The top is really nice. Sims to be good quality too. Color is the same as on picture. However the size is way too small. I usually wear mid - large and ordered extra large, because I was aware that the top runs small...but it's way too small. Since I took all the tags off I gave it to my friend. She is very tiny, hope she will fit into it. They should really change the sizing chart..",2
661605,"Craftsmanship sucked so bad, within five minutes of trying to put this on it broke. Literally impossible to put on unless I had someone assist me. The only good thing to come from this trash product is a new addition to my ring collection. Wish I could get back the money for this undersized piece of garbage.",1
501844,"I love this bag!  I only gave 4 stars because I am short (5'2) and I can't adjust the strap as much as I'd like.  None the less, this is my travel purse on vacation and for work.  I go to DC a lot and keep my metro card in the strap zipper pocket. I have been know to carry shoes, light jacket, as well as wallet, etc. in this bag.  I love the mesh outside pocket for a water bottle or small umbrella.",4
799144,"The cut is great, just the right cut on the shoulders. It's sort of a pain that it's hand wash only since it's sort of a gym shirt. I did receive this shirt on a discount for my honest review and I honestly couldn't be happier ill be looking at other products from this line because this shirt is just awesome.",4
214449,"This is a pretty decent formalwear produced waistcoat. If you are going to use this once or twice a year, this will serve you just fine.
Not terribly robust for ""daily"" wear. Sizing is a full size too small, so order a size larger than you need if you are a ""western""/European frame.",4
449334,"Sooo bummed it was a small, I don't know how it slipped past me. I wasn't paying attention that day obviously. But its a great shirt. Doesn't let let you order any other size though. Ill give it away as a gift but man i want one of these in a large so bad!!

*UPDATE*
I inquired about the sizes and Wicked Quick responded in minutes. So that deserves all the stars I can give! Helpful but still no large :( It will make a cool gift.",5
681782,Great dress and great value. Didn't want to spend a lot for something I wouldn't wear again. Did have to add fabric to the back but anticipated that from the picture. The gold elastic belt had a few loose threads that showed black elastic underneath was only coated with metallic gold paint,4
15969,"The ring is very lovely. Not quite the way it is pictured, but still very nice to look at and well-sized. But be careful and examine yours when you get it. Mine has a section that digs into my finger if I wear it ""wrong,"" so I don't wear it that often.",4
584123,"Wallet looks exactly how pictured, but it is smaller/tighter than any other wallet I've owned. As a result, I can't fit as many cards as I'd like, and it takes forever to get something like my drivers licence out. Still looks cool though, and it's fun to show off to other Assassins Creed fans. That being said, still not as functional as I'm used to.",3
201717,"These are inexpensive but well made.  The finish is very nice.  I don't use the anodized clips much . .  they look a little hinky, but the chrome polished units get more than their share of use.  I like the way they have a swivel clamp under my tie that holds the tie securely and restricts the tie from twisting.  One thing, however, the under clip has sharp teeth that will snag the cloth of the shirt if you try to remove it too quickly.  For the price, that are a good value",4
514940,"Love this suit! The bottoms are a little tight but the top fits great. I've been wearing the top with a separate set of black bottoms. The bow is a bit awkward in size (too big) but I just tuck mine into the cups at the bottom and then it looks better.  Even for just half the suit, it's well worth the buy! I get a lot of compliments!",5
128203,"This is a great jacket for the price. Fits well, stylish, and very comfortable. My only complaint is that it really does not fold into the pocket. Or if it does, I'm not savvy enough to figure it out. So, I just fold it as small as possible and shove it inside a quart-sized ziplock.",4
15498,"I developed plantar fasciitis (sp?) from standing on concrete 40 hrs a week for 15 years, and had to find something to help with the pain. These fit well in all of my tennis shoes that have removable inserts (most brand names), and into my leather slip-ons as well. They have a very high arch, which is what I need. They saved me hundreds because I didn't have to buy all new shoes, too!",5
719779,"I was very excited to order the pendant. However, when it arrived, I was disappointed.  The meager piece of dried dandelion inside is barely recognizable as a dried dandelion.  The chain is the flimsiest chain I have ever had.  The wish tag fell off.  I am not very pleased with this item.",1
722661,"It is so hard to find a WOAC for lass $$$, and this one was the perfect size to hold cards, money, some change, earbuds, and my cell phone. Unfortunately, the reads at the end of the zipper came out after just a month of use, making it useless. I guess you get what you pay for.",1
229639,It is a very nice necklace that looks pretty and is perfect for summer! The metal looks great and feels like just as great. The black leather like strings the beads and metal are on seems fine. The only annoyance I had with it was that the clasp slid to the from because the beads are not fastened to the front of the necklace they can freely move all along the black leather strings.,5
424945,"This is an update on my previous review.  I wore this watch for 4 (four) days and the band broke!!!  Not only did the picture not represent what they sent... The numerals were standard and black, the one they sent did not say ""platinum"" and the numerals were in a crazy gold (hard to see) script!  The only thing about this purchase that was good, was the fast delivery.  I AM NOT PLEASED!  However, for $12.99...what did I expect...mmmm.",1
274040,"Love this necklace.  It just arrived, and immediately the center ""stone"" fell off, but a little super glue, and it is now perfect.  I love leopard print, and this necklace and earring set look great, and the price was so in-expensive.  It looks really good.  I will be wearing this a lot, and would order it again.  Arrived faster than promised.",5
500412,"My friend had this wallet and the moment I saw it, I knew that my old, favorite wallet was history! This wallet has everything I needed and more! Plenty of slots for credit cards, a section for coupons, receipts, and cash. Plus the guarantee of safety with RFID blocking. Great color choices. I would recommend this to anyone.",5
291063,I love this skirt and top! It fits me perfectly. I got a size large and it fits true to size. It is a nice cotton blend material...not that cheap polyester stuff some sites try to sell you. The seller only charged me $3.99 for overnight shipping which was great since I need this outfit for my trip and it arrived right on time! I am very satisfied with my purchase! I'll be buying from this seller again for sure!,5
432202,"I knew it was going to be small. I expected that. But, it does not exactly look like the picture. It is not symetrical in shape. It is unevenly made and the middle part with the blue diamonds is not even round like shown. It is round in one area and pointy in another. Very poorly made and represented. Don't waste your money.",1
534628,"Came bent, tarnished and dented with sharp edges and a very poor seem job on the two pieces of metal glued together. I guess that's to be expected after going through the mail system for a month and a half, do not buy! You could find better quality at a dollar store.",1
621,"CK is a favorite underwear brand of mine for years because of repeat-washing durability along with use of good quality, comfortable cotton. These v-necked tee shirts are no exception. I'd buy them again. Would have preferred slightly more length in the body, but I am long-waisted. Perhaps a tall size would have been better for me, but then the short sleeves tend to be too long, so I went with the XL. I would purchase these again, and probably will.",5
466242,after a month it started making noise. you cant her the noise unless its dead quite. i just turn the winder off at night. sometimes i forget to turn it off and i don't notice the noise. the noise is not that loud. it only needs to run a few hours a day anyway so for the price cant complain,3
723843,"The top is a purple color not a royal blue, but it's still cute and soft so I'll keep it. The V-neck cuts pretty deep so I should have worn a tank underneath it when I went to work. It would also be great for moms who breastfeed. Cool summer work or anytime shirt! Would have given 5 stars if I knew it was purple not blue.",4
231354,"If you haven't tried Saxx ... do. It can be hard to find a pair that don't look ridiculous. The redeeming value; I worked putting in docks for a few years, and now I sit at a desk for 10 hrs straight 5 days a week. NOTHING is more comfortable on your genitals. Not even going commando.",5
600756,"I really like this gown a lot.  I ordered in purple size small, the fit very nice.  I had to hem it because I didn't want it on the floor, afraid I might trip in it.  I did the alteration myself and it was perfect.  I got so many compliments on my outfit at the formal I attended, I made a sparkle head piece in a lighter shade of dress and it was a hit.  Thanks for this product.  Recommend it highly",5
216089,The box that it was shipped in was too small. Top couldn't be taped down all the way so the top of hat was damaged. Brim was rolled under to fit into the box as well. Ordered replacement and returning this one. Hopefully the replacement comes in a properly sized box to avoid damage.,1
570839,"It was small for me, but overall with dealing with the seller and coming to an agreement it made everything work out. Even though I bought it for myself and it didn't work out , I was able to give it to my daughter. Glad I worked out an arrangement to make all parties happy!",3
529849,Do not order from BIGFLY!  They consistently get it wrong!  I ordered a lilac belt.  The bar code placed over another bar code says lilac but the belt is a pale pink.  I ordered a different product from them a couple years ago and had the same issue.  Belt is cheaply made.  My daughter refused to try it on.,1
668904,"Great dress, especially for the price. It arrived when it was expected to and is very soft and comfortable. I am 5'3"" and 107 lbs and I ordered a medium since these are Asian sizes, and it fit like a glove. It is tight enough to flatter my figure, but is not constrictive whatsoever. I was worried the crochet/lacy part would be scratchy, but it is very soft and breathable. The material is fairly good quality and the chiffon part on the bottom is nice and flow-y. Overall, I love it!",5
221365,I'm extremely happy with this necklace and with the price. The black cord is simple and adjustable which I love and the hand itself is very detailed and well made. My necklace came within a couple weeks. It's a tiny bit bigger than I thought it would be but that's fine I don't mind at all. If you like this type of jewelry then I definitely recommend this and you can't beat the price.,5
558696,The price was fair and the product fit I just wasn't a fan of the color. I thought it was more of a purplish color but it's really a blue. There also gold flecks mixed in. Really I didn't have an issue with them so I wouldn't tell someone not to buy it. Also there was a few times the back fell out but that really just happens. Overall a good product.,4
612053,"Bottoms were too tight, and the top was WAY too big. Bottoms also were rather high rise which I didn't expect. I went with a large after reading reviews, but the sizing was just off. I'm a 34C cup and it was way too big. Probably best for DD (or someone with a larger band size). I'm a size 4/6 on bottom, and large would've been better for a size 2/4 (smaller hips).",2
603524,I ordered XL considering these are for kids shoes and they ended up being really long. I doubled up the lacing and they work perfectly! The doubled up lacing even looks really good too. I would absolutely order these again and wish I found these instead of the previous ones I ordered. These are so much easier to use!!,5
657671,"This dress should have been beautiful.  It had everything I was looking for.  But it had a MAJOR flaw- this thing is TRANSPARENT on top with two white circles for your boobs!  The close up of the bodice DOES NOT show that!!!  If it had been lined.... but it is not.  As is, I looked like a Viking lead singer in an opera!",1
76444,"I'm only four months along, so I can't say how this will work later on. But so far it's a great for transitioning into the bump, especially with jeans and heavier dress pants. I have to fold it over (bellys not big enough yet to wear it full length), which can cause some extra bulk. I wouldn't recommend wearing a fitted shirt with this folded unless its forgiving. Otherwise it's great and is saving me a lot of money by not having to buy as many maternity pants. Definitely recommend.",4
113156,"These wings are very pretty.  My daugher is extremely happy with them.  The screen printing is very well done.  She is a rather small 12 year old but these wings were not too large for her so for an adult, the wing span might be a bit short.  The wings pair perfectly with her purple butterfly costume.  If the need ever arose again, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase these wings again.",5
692714,The dress is cute.  It fit great and is comfortable.  You may want a slip for under since it is thin.  It is very thin material and came without the belt.  I like it but I am not sure how many washes it will last through.  The stitching and material are not high quality.  It is worth the price as long as it last through a few months or wear.,3
457748,This is a heavy duty belt that suggests it will be around for a long time to come. The entire buckle assembly rotates so one may use either the brown side out or the black side out. I have used it several times now and am completely satisfied with it.,5
257486,"Strong weave, well made shirt that has been through the wash at least a dozen times, I can't see any wearing down at all. The material is made of makes it really form-fitting, and was tighter than I'd expected. The shirt is plenty long (I find a lot of maternity/nursing tops too short). However, it does creep up because of how tight mine is, and the slick material. For the price and the quality, it's a good deal!",4
612363,"I love these shoes.  I stated that they were somewhat small, only because my measurements fit a 9 shoe, but my foot hits about 1/4"" over when I stand up.  Not too big of a deal, but if at the store, I would have tried the 10 on to compare.  I could have returned these just to try the 10, but they were too cute and I wanted to wear them right away.  That 1/4"" wasn't a deal breaker for these.",5
49496,"I had heard great things about the belly bandit, but this was such a bummer! It was WAY to small - I'm a size 4 - 6 waist 27 pre pregnancy and around currently while losing weight. I know you're supposed to cinch this, but you would need a tractor to get this thing to velcro together! Not sure who they are setting the small to fit.",1
86273,"This dress was made for short/petite ladies. I am 5'10"" it was not made for me. The size is as expected but the waist is uncomfortably high and the belt really draws attention to that. If you are 5'7"" or below, you will look great in this. If you are tall, keep shopping.",3
33186,"I originally ordered this jacket in a medium and it did not fit so I sent it back and reordered a large. This one did not fit either.  When I requested a refund, they promptly credited me for it with no questions or waiting as I have experienced with other companies.  Cudos to you.  You are a great company!!!!!",5
354350,"I would never purchase these again. They are very tight in the waist and have huge leg openings. My son is tall and skinny abd they're so tight that he can't wear them. He's in a size 3T-4T and I ordered a size 4/5 so he could wear them as soon as he outgrew his other underwear but they don't even fit. I wish I could return them, but I'm 2 days past the return cut off :( The only reason I gave 2 stars is for the organic cotton fabric. Save your money and buy something else.",2
58392,"The size chart In the listing when I ordered was wrong. I was hoping to find travel socks for my son, currently wearing a size four shoe (youth size = ladies size.) The size small is much too big. It fits my size 7.5 foot much better than his size 4.

Yes, these are thin, but I expected, and wanted that. I buy travel socks almost exclusively for overnight wash-and-wear. I wear Tilley travel socks myself, and love them, but hoped for something cheaper for a boy who wears out socks very quickly.",3
284201,"I like the vibrant pastel blue color. but maybe a little too ""baby shower ish"". It's definitely not a dress...unless your intentions are to show your chones. From the other reviews I knew to expect a tunic top. So,I wasn't dissapointed. One thing I didn't like was the drawstring. It was too high up. It was right below my breast. I was expecting it to be closer to the waist. I'm keeping it because it's a cute, casual, comfortable top to wear to school.",4
500727,Awful!!! Smells chemically and gross. Terribly cheap material. There are no bottoms!!! This is just a top and it barely comes down to my hips. No shelf bra for support. The little clear strap isn't even in there. It does not look even close to as cute as the pic. Do not purchase!!! Again this is not a one piece suit. Just a cheaply made ill fitting top. Its not even made of normal swimsuit material. Its made more like a fashion top. I needed a shower after trying it on because it smelled so bad.,1
211964,This is a very beautiful necklace I got it for my sister for her 17th birthday and she loves it my mom also loves it the picture on the necklace aren't nearly as beautiful as when you see it in person if you come to the reviews to see if you'll like the necklace or not like I do then take my advice it's worth it it's the best gift for anyone,5
45446,"This product is very difficult to use.  The packaging states that you can put them on a ring when it is on your finger and that simply is not possible.  The plastic is too thick and too hard.  It does not mold to the shape of the ring, making them uncomfortable.  They also come off too easily when you take your ring off.",1
237370,"As a 5'1"", about 130 pounds, I got the small size and it's a good fit. I don't know if a medium would have been a better fit, but everything seems to fit pretty well except for the part where you stick your feet through. It doesn't look as loose as it does in the picture and stretches above my ankles. It's not making me upset but just in case you're about the same size as me, consider if small is for you.",5
645126,"This wallet is really nice, and it's really cute! It's good quality too! Just be careful of how you open it because I must have been a little rough opening it seeing as it's tearing a bit. In all seriousness, you would have to try to rip the wallet for any actual damage to occur though. There's also enough room to place my phone in the wallet (an iPhone 5s, but you could definitely fit a larger phone in there).",5
124207,"I'm 5'3, 138 lbs and I bought a medium that literally fits like a glove. I'm a curvy girl and this dress is just a little too fitted for work. I mean I love it because my butt looks really nice in it but it's too sexy for work , which is what I bought it for.",4
76322,"I can wear all my old pants that still fit my thighs :)  I was worried I would have to get maternity pants, but now I am thankful I can wait for a while longer.  The size is confusing and I had to go to another website to figure out what size to get, but it fits comfortably, is really soft, and does the job well.",5

22243,"Disappointed in this hat!  We bought it 3 months ago and my son wore it 5 times.  It was great when he wore it, but somehow one of the strings got lost in the hat so now I can't tighten it.  It's way too big without the option to tighten it. :(",2
303126,Kind of a foggy looking plastic and the flat end for inside the mouth isn't really flat.. More blunt than id prefer..

Elmo, Big Bird, Oscar, and Super Grover...his favorite by the way. The size is 2T-3T but they seem a little small. They are also a little stiff, probably due to all the graphics on them, for the exception of those two items I would've given 5 stars.",4

The collar of the dress is the only reason why I do not like it. The collar is seriously close to 6 inches long, and looks very pilgrimesque; and not even Wednesday Addams pilgrim... But like hideous.

A little disappointing to see the inner flap of the pocket was not hemmed so i expect it will probably come apart after the first wash. It's super cute to wear thou, a lovely addition to anyone's closet.",4
58623,"Belt is just OK. The large size fits a 34"" waist well. The length was fine. The buckle is a bit flimsy and can be knocked out of shape easily. My biggest problem is with the non-buckle end(There must be a name for it). Is too large to fit through the buckle and the loop with a bit of wiggling. And the the leather finished end is very thick and that makes it very hard to pass through the belt loops on most pants. On the good side, the belt is highly adjustable.",3
505829,i was really disappointed on receiving them i have another pair of mk 58mm aviator but a different model and they fit feel and look perfect ...but these ones looked abit cheap they were really light in weight and more like a 52mm cause they looked too neat on my face the blue was really dark i thought they were brighter all  in all not what i expected but thats just my personal view point another person may feel totally opposite just wasn't cutting it for me sorry!!!,3

But it is a stronger chain then almost all the others I have tried, and for less then three dollars its a great piece. Can look great with actual clothes, not just bikinis and stuff. I haven't tried it with a dress yet but with pants and a softer flair peplum it looks great.",4

I am 5'2 and it came down to my fingertips, so it was long enough for my dress code at my school.

The hold isn't great.  Sometimes my tie has more movement than I would like.  That being said, it holds much better than some tie clips I've seen.

The colors are great and the price is fantastic.  Even if they don't hold up for a long time, I love this set for the price.",4

Took ages to arrive and not worth the wait. Returned next day. Ugh!",1

For me to wear this out, I will have to wear a jacket over it. I do not feel comfortable with EVERything showing the way it hugs all. Plus, because it's white (I'm guessing) whatever I do or don't wear underneath is shown.
The material is a jersey and soft, but it is so light weight something has to be worn on top of it.",2

Otherwise, very nice looking sandals.  Looks nice in cuffed jeans.",4

I plan to buy another pack soon.",5

It is a hit or miss for these pants.",3

718793,This is the worst purchase I have EVER made from Amazon. Buyer beware -it looks NOTHING like the photo. I ordered the army great and it is more of a Christmas tree green. It is horrific.  Not even sure than it makes sense to send it back since it took FOREVER to arrive. Beyond disappointed.  I will NEVER buy from this dealer again.,1

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the beige parts in the scarf didn't appear to be beige but more of a soft blush beige color. All in all it is a great scarf for the price.,4
36557,Love the umbrella but it had a hole in the top of the umbrella when it arrived. We purchased the polka dot one and it appears the decals stuck and when opened must have put a hole in the umbrella.  Thankful for free returns.  I will order a solid color to replace this one and hopefully won't have an issue.,3

Third, it's described as being thick, which it most certainly is not that. The only thing they got right in the description is that it is double breasted.

To prevent the replacement screw heads for the new pins from backing out, use Loctite Blue (or a comparable thread locker) on their screw  threads during assembly. The only thing to note is that with this setup (wearing a NATO-style band), the watch sits a bit higher on my wrist. The Core is a 'bulky' watch anyway, so this isn't too much of a problem for me.",4

 I am also not convinced that the sizing is correct. I had my finger sized by a jeweler, ordered that size, and had to return it to order a half-size bigger. That half-size bigger ring is still a tiny bit small.",3

The fabric has a lot of stretch so if you wanted to size down you could probably still fit into it but I do not think it would be as flowy as it is. I especially love the price. At this price point I will probably buy several more in different colors.",5

389142,I ended up returning this.  I know this sounds weird but the purse would not stand up straight.  It kept falling forward.  The bottom of the bag was not wide enough to support it if you had anything in the front pocket.  I did not have the pockets stuffed or unbalanced.  Drove me crazy.,2
204003,"I have short hair but this fits well,a little on the larger side but I  can not stand anything tight on my head. It is soft and very warm. The glove part is nice as sometimes to or from the car or bringing in grocery I forget my gloves and my hands get very cold. These 'gloves' warm my hands fast. The only problem is I have yet to find a way to just take the hood down, not all of it off when I am in a store.",4
488811,"I'm going to go ahead and tell you that they are a bit large, so sometimes the fabric around the ankles will flare out, but the look is perfect. It's tough without being grungy, and you can wear them with jeans and a t-shirt or a skirt. Very wearable...just remember to double-knot the laces.",5
337448,I'm going to say it's just ok! If u wear a dress and can see where u can see at the bottom of rear where it lifts just not really good. The whole idea of wearing is to lift bottom not create a stare from ppl saying wtf is she wearing! So If u order u already know what to expect!,2
43890,"They shipped a clear umbrella instead of one with dots, but my grandson loves it. The plastic is heavy and firmly attached to the spokes. The tip is blunt and safe. Just the right size for a five year old. I fit under it comfortably. Now we need some rain to give it a try.",5
787990,"I ordered the red one, its the same color. Although the emblem is not black as the picture depicts, its actually a light grey. I ordered this for my wife, she wears a small in just about everything but I ordered a medium just in case, I should have ordered a large due to how short the shirt is. I suggest ordering TWO sizes larger.",3
671865,It's a pretty a dress but the pleats were not intact and were gapped. I had to pay for it to be fixed after spending $49.99 on the dress. The wire at the breast kept sticking me and very uncomfortable. Even though it worked for what I needed it for I would not buy this dress again.,3
48054,A little too wide for American belt loops but seems to be well built.  I notice that the tapered tip catches on the belt loops when I pull the belt out of the pants.  Never had another belt to that but this is wider than normal too.  Overall a good belt.  Hope it stands up better than the Chinese made belt I bought 2 months ago.  The 'retainer loop' broke off.  Tossed that POS.,4
379311,"This romper is very nice! I am 5'7 and weight 320lbs. I am African American and wear 44D bra. The length is nice! I love how the ankles have a slipt so the fit nicely around your ankle. My only reason for giving this romper 4 stars vs the 5 is because  of the print. It isn't horrible and is true to color but it looks like cheap print in purpose... With this being said, for the price I would definitely buy this again.",4
56503,"I love the design of the ring but unfortunately I felt it was a little thick and uncomfortable. Metal Masters had shipped this out to me super fast, which I did appreciate and they were great about my returning the ring, I really do they have some great jewelry, i'll be back in the near future to order more as i'm always looking for great rings!!",3
551310,"Not sure if I will keep them or return.  I ordered other letters such as G & Q, however the C is much smaller in size than the other letters.  The price is the same as the large letters, as well as the description say the are the same size.  Not happy right now.",1
692442,"I ordered this as a starter set for myself because I already broke the tips on some of my dad's screwdrivers. I picked this one because it was cheap and was supposed to have came with an extra set of tips. I opened the package and it didn't have the extra tips. In light of the fact that it is missing parts, I say one star.",1
86015,"These came torn by where the drawstring is inserted.  I sewed it myself rather than to return, because it was a gift I needed and hadn't the time to reorder another.  The fabric is thin, not quality flannel.  I gave this two stars because the color was bright and a crisp green.  I wouldn't order these again.",2
347306,This dress was for my 30th birthday. Measure your body to the size chart. I was right at a large. I did use fashion tape to hold things in place up top and it worked out perfectly. Beautiful fit. Great quality and the materials were high quality. The color is rose gold. Not true gold.,5
116720,I love leveret pjs. This outfit is so precious. The problem is that the pants are itchy and uncomfortable. What is the point of pjs that aren't soft? It's a waste. Of course I washed them before use and thought they might soften up a bit but they did not. It's just not worth the cute print to have something unpleasant for my baby to sleep in.,2
353460,"You get what you pay for.

I have worn Red Wing & Carolina boots in construction work for 35 years. These laces are the best leather boot laces I have ever put in any pair of boots I've ever worn. They are stronger and more durable than any leather boot laces I've ever used before.

Why are you still reading my review. Order a pair for yourself now before they're out-of-stock!",5
630815,I wanted a nice comfortable piece of clothing for post mastectomy.  This definitely was comfortable but as soon as I was done with my drains (about a week) I was done with this.  Better off investing in some post surgery bras with detachable pockets that can be used for weeks and weeks.,3
373208,"Love them, although I've only had them for a week. They look cool, albeit they are a little heavy, but very good quality. I like the screw in balls on the end, that the skull snaps between. It's like have two rings in one, as you can leave the skull off if you'd like.",5
191377,"The fit of the dress was true to my size but I expected it to be a little longer... The length of the dress hits a bit above my knees (& I'm 5'3""). I was expecting it to at least hit my knees if not longer so now I need to make it work.",2
45958,"5'4"", 116lbs and size small fits perfect and comfortable. it's a snug fit, so wearing any kind of underwear (even a thong) will show the lines. also, when the fabric stretches in the butt area, it's becomes kinda see-through during the daytime when it's still light out,  but once it's night time, you won't be able to see through anythjng. my 11year old son pointed it out to me that he could see my butt through it. it is completely black on the backside; no bones on back, which is a bummer.",5
575574,"Gorgeous watch.  Substantial and looks very expensive.  BUT this no way looks like a ladies watch.  It is absolutely huge. It's bigger than my husband's Rolex Oyster Perpetual. I have never seen a ladies watch with a dial this big. If you want to make a statement, this is the watch, but it is in no way a feminine-looking accessory. I give it four stars for looking so well made and beautiful, and take it down a star because it is just too big.",4
506322,"This kurta is excellet. In another review I did of a different kurta from the same source, I believe now that the fit of kurtas depend upon the 'cut' and the sizing. One type of kurta labeled as an XL, for example, may not fit the same way as a different type with the same sizing label. This kurta cleans up easily and wrinkles are easily removed by a small, cheap steam machine. Good pocket room too for car keys, cell phone, etc.",5
739926,I knew it wasn't going to be exactly as the picture and it's not even close to being. I had seen other reviews saying it wasn't nothing compared to the picture I chose lime green sweatshirt it was a forest green color I only wanted a sweatshirt  i was expecting this forest green color and i wanted it so i really didn't want the lime green color. So I had everything plan out but it's nothing like the picture so If your expecting something exactly like this don't buy I only wanted a common sweatshirt,2
731241,I work outside and got myself 6 pair of these in various colors. Got to work and put on one of these XXL pairs and the pants were above my ankles at the bottom and at the middle of my ass at the top. Felt like Tom Hanks in big,1
115140,"It is hard to imagine what a 2mm chain actually looks like until holding it in person. While this is heavier than the chain it replaced (which broke from an inadvertent tug) it is still light enough that I don't feel as if I'm some thug wannabe.  The construction seems solid and so far (2 weeks) I am very pleased. The clasp is easy to operate.

The true test of anything gold-plated is how it wears over time.  Since I cannot predict that, I can't give the product five stars at this point.",4
718845,"The hat appears to be a normal size in the photo, but when it arrived, it was much longer than expected. It is a little bit bunchy at the top because it's just too long for my head. I ended up returning it because it was too long (also because it was darker than I thought it would be, but the size played the most significant role in that)",3
711547,"Buyer beware.  I bought a number of these masks for a stage production.  The edges of this mask around the eye holes and nose are sharp and will put pressure on your face, leaving red marks.  I avoided that problem by using a hot glue gun to glue parts of regular dish sponges (which I cut up) in the temples, between the eyes and on the jaw line.  So, these masks were usable and effective, but I had to do some work with them to make them comfortably wearable.",3
371417,"Arrived on time and just as it appears on the MODEL (I purchased the green). For reference my measurements are 34C/35 Bust, 31 Waist and Hips 41. The blouse comes with a fitted inner part that continues to the back and a flap in front that gives it the flowy appearance. The colour is as shown in two tones. I tried it on quickly and I will give feedback after washing the blouse.",5
293515,These fit good.  Maybe even a little loose.  I am 5.2 and pear shaped.  I usually wear an 8 and these have a bit of give.  I bet a small would have been a tight fit.  But these aren't so bad as to send them back.  They are 62% cotton then polyester. So they look more like cotton pants than poly ones which is a plus for me.  I like them.,4
396151,"Such a CUTE bracelet! This wonderful design gives the illusion of multiple bracelets all in one. The hanging charms are adorable and it's very high quality! It fits my 10 year old daughter's wrist perfectly, not too tight and no too loose! Shipping was fast and price beyond affordable! ",5
356416,"I received every color except the red, I got orange instead and the picture isn't perfect as to the shade of green and blue I feel but they're all comfy and I like the colors I got so I can't complain. Most of the time I use these soft ones to sleep in so I don't care about the color anyway.",4
262232,"I tried these on earrings before I put them in my ears; they seems quite snug, which is what I wanted.  I now have them in my ears & I'm well pleased.  I feel secure that the earrings will not fall out & get lost.  They are quite small, though.",5
332475,"Good Deal - The price is pretty incredible, the material is harder that one would like.  It is beautiful, I didn't use mine because it took away from the detail of my dress.  If you have a plain skirt then you can use this vail.  Arrived quickly would recommend.",4
718238,"I was looking for a lightweight set of tights for lounging/sleeping during the summer and maybe outdoor wear under clothes in the winter.  These fit the bill well.  They seem to be well-constructed and of good quality and are very comfortable.

I don't have power lifter thighs, so they are a little loose in that area.  Aside from that, the fit was good.

Addition:  Now that I've worn them a few times, they seem to be losing their mojo.  Looser than before and riding up at the ankles.",3
634827,Soft and lightweight sleep clothes!  Length is perfect. Waistband on long pants is a little bit big on my 26 month old daughter. The pants sag but not so much they will fall down. This doesn't bother me because there's room for her to grow. Shorts have more stretch to them and don't have this problem. Top fits great. She's 35 inches tall and weighs 28 lbs. size 2t,4
155100,"It should not take pliers to open this, since I don't take to carrying pliers in my back pocket. This was so difficult to open that even my boyfriend was struggling with it. Since I cant put my boyfriend in my pocket either, this wallet is basically useless to me.",1
397422,"Thin, holds currency by country or value. I marked each section with tape so it was easy to know which money was where even though the sections are color coded. Use it now at home to keep my money separated and in a thin wallet. Even has room for change.",5
203177,"I love this wallet. It's so cute, it has plenty of spots for cards and even a huge zipper pocket that they don't really show in the picture. It's big enough to fit my phone even with a case on. And it came about a week earlier than it was scheduled to. Love it.",5
120740,I have several of these diapers in several sizes.  They fit snuggly and seem to do their job well.  We've used this quite a bit already this summer and so far its holding up well.  It is not a flimsy diaper and has several layers of fabric.  The snaps make putting on and taking off the diaper so much easier.  My only complaint is that it seems to run a bit small compared to what the size chart states.,5
314296,This did NOT come with the case! the is why its a 4 star and not a 4. the quality was as expected cheap but can be over looked because of how many you get in the pack. it did come with a lot of verity but now everything in the picture. i did now count it yet but i will update this witha pick and how many do come in the bag.,3
124485,"I'm 5'7 and a size 2-4.  The small fit perfectly. The slit is pretty high when you walk, so I recommend at least wearing tights underneath.  I wouldn't wear it to a cosplay competition, but it was a great costume for the office Halloween party!  Super comfortable too.  I'm catching a flight (yes, in costume... no, no dragon) in it and don't expect any comfort problems.",4
271141,"I really like the way these jeans fit. The spandex in the jeans allows the pants to not gap in the waist. The pants are also very flattering on. Another plus is that if you are tall you will get the length that you need. I am nearly 5'9"" and the pants fit great!",5
318161,I love this sweater! Looks adorable on! The company is MORE than accommodating! I ordered the sweater in a small (my normal size) and it was way too small. I wrote to the company and they immediately fixed the problem and sent me a new one in a bigger size!!! Would recommend just order big!,5
67121,"it is very cute and I love the words as I do know He loves us all  THE ONLY NEGATIVE ABOUT IT IS THERE IS  BIG FAT LETTERS
SAYING ""CHINA"" ON THE INSIDE NOT SILVER PLATED OR COATED JUST CHINA. NOT IMPRESSED WITH THAT AT ALL
MAKES IT LOOK CHEAPER THAN IT WAS . I DO NOT LIKE TO BUY CHINA ONLY USA SO VERY DIAPPOINTED BUT AGAIN LIVE AND LEARN",3
132614,"It's cute and my son loves it, but it's huge. It's too large for him to wear.  It doesn't fit on my head and not on my husband's either. This hat is extremely big. I don't suggest anyone purchase this for a child, as it's too big for an adult's head.",3
743594,"Sexy. Fit as expected. I'm 5'2 about 120 32b. Straps on bra and waist thingy are adjustable. I've used it a couple times but don't think it will last very long. But for the price and my first impression when I pulled it out of the bag, staying intact for one use was surprising.",4
758610,"I love this piece, the quality of the stones appear to be great as far as body jewelry is concerned.  I wore it to the beach this last weekend and it held up fine, but I didn't spend much time in the water.  We will see how it holds up after more wear.",5
381495,"Only briefcase that I could find with two side pockets for drinks (good).  Nice and long for 14"" clip board (good).  However, the clips kept coming offshoot attached the front flap to the front (very bad).  They are magnetic.  I just kept them off, so as not to lose them forever.  Hence, I cannot really close the case normally (bad).",3
277607,"Love this hourglass waist trainer, if your gonna wear be prepared to sit up like a pencil, it does give a little bit of rubber smell but it goes away. If your a medium size shirt or sweater get the size small. I use medium size clothing and got a size small and it fits perfectly. I wear it to workout and walk around do chores at home, definitely recommend this one also gonna buy another one:)",5
815837,"This  is a gorgeous swimsuit for a great price.  The front of the swimsuit conceals, but makes it super cute too.  I can't attest to how this will hold up over time, but the materal is heavier and I did wash it once and it still looks nice.  Very happy with my purchase!",5
706901,"Its horrible & look nothing like the picture! I was going to take this thin sheer material to a young person that loves to play around with clothes to let him make something out of this piece of material that was shipped to me. But decided why pay more to have it fixed, when I brought it to just wear. It's extra big as well. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY !!!!!!!",1
584442,"Really liked the boxers, great quality, timely shipping. I ordered as (fun) gift for my son to replace a pair we had bought him 10yrs ago on vacation...and plain Budweiser boxers are hard to find! I was surprised at the price, it seemed high for boxers, however, when they arrived I was very, very pleased with the quality.",5

The glasses are not as strongly made as a $20 steel frame pair and can break more easily, but who cares at this price.  The last order had thicker contruction and should hold up well.",4
162687,"Love this dress! It looks exactly as the photo shows. The material is stretchy, and dress fits me perfect (I usually wear a medium). I do have a large chest (34DD), which makes dress shopping difficult at times, but this one stretches in all the right places without distortion. The material feels great and is very flowy. I have received numerous compliments on my dress.",5
543972,"First off, these are absolutely not stockings. These are socks that took a month and a half to ship. Thigh highs nonetheless, but l payed money for cute little stockings so I didn't have to deal with the constant hassle of pulling up socks, or folding them, ect. The socks aren't even good quality. I mean come on guys.",1
813281,"I love the look of retro swimwear, unfortunately being that I'm super heavy on top (40DD) the structure of the top was not providing ANY support what so ever. I was so bummed. For someone that may not be so top heavy this design may work, I just wasn't willing to risk a wardrobe malfunction.",2
770641,"These are currently sitting in my stack of cannot wear because they are way too small. I chose the size based on the size chart and reviews, but they just do not fit. I meant to return but got so busy that it was past the return date when I remembered. Oh well, they are with the stack of pants that if I could just lose 1 size they would fit.",2
750236,"The neckline is not at all like the picture but it still fits ok and im sure I will wear it. The length in the arms is great but the layer look as shown in the picture is not what what it looks like on. It's more like a high low. It goes straight across on the front. I ordered a med. Fit it fine I'm 5'6"".",3
462161,"These are not as soft as the light blue/pink Genie bras and the black/white bras with the lace on them. I LOVE those. These are rougher, thicker and a less stretchy fabric. They fit tighter too. I didn't return them but I don't like to wear them very often. They are very supportive to wear while jogging though.",3
22402,"My baby's head is a bit smaller than average and I have had a difficult time finding a hat that fits.  This was perfect because it allowed me to adjust the size from the back.  It's also light weight and breathes well, so it's perfect for summer heat.",5
130369,If you are a tall lady this will be too short for you my daughter in law really wasn't happy with this dress when we received it ir had a black spot on it ordered another it didn't get here in time for my party so she had to wear the one with the spot.,5
379731,Good color.  I needed this under a dress that was hitting at the top of my knee and I wanted a little longer.  Color is a great match - the lace at the bottom matches the color of the dress even though the material above is a bit more yellow.  Fit is very comfortable and lays nicely underneath with no ride up.  Ordered the S/M.,5
360914,"Great size selection on these earrings.  They are wrapped individually in case you want to give any away.  I way afraid that the way they were shipped that the backs would all be bent, but they weren't.  Nice variety of sizes.  Good price and would definitely order again.  They haven't bothered my ears as far as sensitivity goes, and they haven't turned green, either.  Love these!",5
300144,"Good quality, but I cant agree with the manufacturers that you should size down for half sizes.  I wear a 9 1/2, and ordered a nine.  Have to return and order a 10 (which in the other silicone ring company is a bit big) because the 9 was leaving an uncomfortable dent in my finger after only a couple of wears.",4
148906,The fabric on this nightgown is nice. It fits the way I want it to. It pulls down nicely for easy breastfeeding or skin to skin. I am also thinking about wearing it to leave the hospital since it looks close enough to a dress for me to wear from the room out to the car and decent enough to wear when company visits right after the baby is born.,5
178530,this is perfect! just as pictured!! i'm in love with it..some people said in the comments that they had a dent or wrinkle in the package due to the packaging but i didn't have a problem with that all. i opened it and it went right to the shape it's supposed. and it's great quality!,5
768142,"I give 3 stars because they are totally see-thru! You must wear a long shirt or dress over the butt. Other than the see-thru issue they are very cute and comfy, they are more shimmery than I imagined them to be, but not crazily so. Overall I do like these. My belly measures 49"" and these do not seem to dig into my fat in any kind of unusual way. I have not worn them for any length of time yet, I only tried them on.",3
121922,"This item is a joke. I just bought another lifter and i should have just paid the extra money for a good one to begin with. I am 150 lbs and already have a nice amount,just wanted a little lift in certain outfits but instead i got a misshapen  alien booty....lol. Im not over weight and didn't need the compression feature....thankfully bc i cant possibly see how this cheap fabric would compress anything.",1
138225,"I am not sure who would fit into this.  My wife tried this and (like others have said) it doesn't fit at all.  The top strap is too long, the bottom straps are too short.  We can't see it fitting any normal human shape top or bottom without a lot of modification.
Also, it fell apart just holding it up to look at it so that we could figure it out.  Putting it on seemed to void the warranty.  :o)",2
851452,"We live in a subtropical climate and the sun can be brutal on my daughters' light eyes. I did some serious research on infant sunglasses and the Baby Banz kept popping up. I purchased. My husband was convinced our babies would immediately tear the glasses from their heads, but to his surprise (and my delight), the girls have kept these glasses on for the entire duration of whatever outdoor activity we're doing. Really comfortable! Really love them!",5

807002,"The top was cute, but I wanted something loose-fitting like the picture, and the item I received was very clingy despite ordering two sizes up from where I actually fell on the sizing chart, per recommendations in the reviews. If you want the shirt to drape nicely, try three sizes up. It probably shouldn't be billed as plus-size; I'm a M and ordered an XL!",3
393205,I bought these for my almost 4 year old. She is tall and thin and has been in 5Ts or kids size small for a while. I bought size 6 and they're perfect. These are not loosely fitted and are more of a slim fit. The colors are also vibrant and kind of neon. For the price they are great basic shirts.,5
701995,"The sleeves and shoulder-to- shoulder fit of this shirt is much smaller than I had expected.  I ordered two of these shirts in two different sizes.  XL and 1XL.  the XL is my usual size, but this particular article of clothing was much smaller than anticipated.  Couldn't even button it.  Will have to return : @",3
133431,I love the shoe and it fit as expected the photos and description are accurate if you're looking for a shoe that has more cushion or support try a different style but as far as wanting a lightweight and breathable shoe this is it. I am very satisfied with this purchase,5
404023,"This would have been absolutely great had it fit. I knew the bra was going to be too small after reading the reviews, but I was more interested in the garter belt anyways. Yes. The bra is too small. The garter is really well constructed and really cute and sexy. But it was huge! It was pretty much falling off of me. Not a great look. Love the fact that the hooks were metal. That's hard to find. Would have been absolutely in love with it, had it fit me.",3
4569,"I ordered this robe for my 88 year old mother back east. I was told by my sister, that it is beautful and very soft and will be very warm on my mother. I am so happy to know this. She says it is really lovely and arrived as new.",5
501590,Fits was perfect.  I know it is hard to find the right size with online orders but this fitted me just perfectly.  The color is just a little bit lighter green than pictured.  The material is Chiffon as indicated. Sorry for the cropped picture.  I had to crop the faces.,5
574511,No they are too small for me they were really cute. I can see that if they fit me well I would wear them a lot. It's totally okay but they were too small as I can give them to a friend that may be able to fit them better. I receive the product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.,5
842700,"Very pretty the way it fits me, but after only a few wears it's showing some damage. I can't figure out if it's a heat mark or the beginnings of a run, like with nylon stockings. But it looks lighter than the surrounding material and so it looks like a stain on the front of my shirt. It's disappointing. The material definitely doesn't hold up long. I wore and washed it under typical circumstances so I didn't expect this to happen.",3
730410,"These fit perfect and feel great to wear! Paired these with gym shorts and you'll have some major bounce in your step. Worn in jeans or dress pants, these give extra thickness and pop to your third appendage, so be prepared for some sideways looks. I bought two more pairs and wear them often.",5
817979,"Thought these were somewhat cheap sunglasses until I only got about three hours out of the pair before it fell apart.  The price per hour is kinda high!  Nose piece fell off and lost the screw.  As far as looks and comfort, both are five stars.  Durability is where the review gets docked.  I bought a three pack of these so maybe the other two will have a little better longevity.",3
678440,"This swim short fit my very thin 6 year old perfectly. She normally wears size 5, as she is very thin. Looks really cute too. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for something a little more modest for their little one. She says it is very comfortable as well.",5
831810,Belt and buckle look nice and the material is good quality. I've been on a diet the last several months and went from a 38-inch waist to 34. This belt is perfect for my weight loss but is just fine for normal use. It looks nice not to have belt holes or extra tail sticking out. I cut 7-inches off the belt to get it into my range. This is easy to do by opening the tab on the back of the buckle to release the belt leather. Cut with kitchen shears and replace. Perfect!,5
51348,"These compression stockings are super. My husband and I both wear them. And if you want to know a secret to getting them on, put a little powder on your legs first. Put the socks on your foot and zip up the leg these go. Easy as pie. Even for these old hands that have arthritis",5

762550,The quality is good and all the sizes were there. However I ordered the rose goldtone and received gold instead. So i returned them and the customer support was great. But I reordered them and was sent gold again. So I think that their rose goldtone is really just gold,3

After leaving without it a little heart broken I decided to check and see if I could find it on here and I did and it was 6 dollars cheaper!

343107,"Such a cute shoe! I'm a women's size 5.5 and bought the kids size 4. The shoes fit perfectly and are so comfortable out of the box. They're a little more narrow and flop around less than the adult size shoes but still have the same look. I love them! If you have narrow to medium size small feet, definitely consider buying the kids size versus the adult. Bonus- cost savings!",5
228004,"The top is kinda small. But the skirt seems regular size. However, I don't really like the way the skirt is designed. The skirt does not have an elastic waistband, but instead is held together, and adjusted by a velcro strap. I'd prefer the skirt to have an elastic waistband. Also the material could be softer.

The socks are really good though. They fit well, and they're soft and warm.",3
470347,"This thing is pretty awesome. Functions well and so far has held up to heavy use. It's easy to use when your hands are full too. It's nice to know that once it's locked in place it isn't going anywhere and now I don't have to worry about my keys, remote start and the key fob. To think, before I got this, I used to keep all that in my back pocket.",5

Not a fan of the cheap metal that hold the straps either.  I got the blue color and it has variation that I didn't see on the pictures but it look nice and the color is pretty. Got this to use at work from time to time carrying files and small equipment I use for my job. Would I purchase another one? Probably not.",4

They are both defective and they expect me to pay shipping to get my money back?!  Beware!  Stay away from these!,1

It actually looks like real money. I know I still get faked out half the time. It holds quite a bit. It feels like vinyl with a tiny diamond texture print imprinted on it. So it looks dull like real money. Kinda felt like it too at first, not so much now. Still it's really a great wallet. Recommend this wallet, Recommend this seller!",5

Good price and comfortable, oh! and fast shipping to my house.",5

My only complaint is that the color online (on my computer anyway) appears turquoise and the earrings are definitely green.  Here it says color: taurus but on the packaging it actually says both taurus and emerald.  Would have been helpful when ordering, I might have gotten a different color.  That said, even though they aren't what I expected they're still sparkly and gorgeous and I'll wear them for sure.",4

84634,"This was not similar to what is pictured. It is really bad and cheap material. I personally found that the arms are extremely tight which made me want to return it but it is not an easy process so I had to try and cut it to be more comfortable and get some blood to my fingers, that only made it look more trashy and so I basically threw it in the garbage. I was excited for it but I was amazingly disappointed once I received it. Do not buy this product!!!",1

It is the size I ordered because I had just order a different shirt in medium and it was too small so I went back and ordered a large to find out is way too big.

The tulle underneath is sewn into the bottom so there is no scratchy material directly on your thighs. If you want you can fill it out more with a petticoat but I haven't felt the need. I love this one and wear it anywhere and no matter what always get a compliment. Probably my favorite dress!,5

The sleeves are 3/4 length so the tunic can be worn into autumn.  The back ties help to fit the tunic to your shape and not feel so bulky.,5

I was initially quite happy with these. I had even given them 5 stars for a good fit and comfort. However, after only two months of use they have developed holes in the heel area.

I would suggest sizing it based on your height. I am happy with the color, I got olive green.",5

There was no way that watch was water resistant at all, our humidity levels are hard pressed to even reach 55% at the worst...",1

The dress came w/blue beads on it so trying to figure out how to replace the blue beads w/red beads without unraveling all the other beads.  Wish me luck!",3
454417,I ordered one as a gift and one for myself.  When I opened up the first one and the stitching came undone.  The 2 me one is fine so I will give it as a gift.  I really love these as I have one I purchased a year ago in a different color and love it.,4
74879,"I had no idea that at 9 weeks my jeans would become so uncomfortable to wear all day, I should have bought one of these sooner. It was rough holding out for it to arrive. For now I just double it over and it covers my open button well, and it should work great when theres less room later.",5
231817,"Bought these for my husband because he is obsessed with this brand.  He loves the ""man hammock"" inside of them and said it has done wonders for chaffing from being active.  We've bought almost 20 pairs now and all have washed up well, held their color and shape and they make him happy.",5
264192,"The skirt is comfortable and soft with a good length which makes a great silhouette. Unfortunately, I was confused by the color. Purple looks burgundy and vice versa. I went against my better judgment and purchased burgundy hoping for the purple one. It was a $20 bet and I lost this one.",3
392395,"These socks are great for keeping our little one's legs warm.  Instead of putting pants of shorts on him, we just add these.  He loves it.  We bought them oversized so we can cover his feet if it was too cold.  Convenient, easy and SUPER cute...",5
14210,I use these in my running shoes and they work really well.  I wear neutral cushioned running shoes and I have extremely high arches. These are the ONLY inserts that I've been able to find that work for me.  They provide good cushioning and the arch support I need.  Definitely recommend.,5
476520,"Love this case.  It is soft and thick, creating a secure case for my eyeglasses.  The fold in the case also provides me with a ""pocket"" to hold something small, like an ink pen or bill money for lunch.  I liked this case, color and design, so much that I decided to use it for my reading glasses and the other purple print for my sunglasses.  Thanks.  This is a great buy.",5
171799,"I had to return this rash guard shirt, the medium which I usually wear in this brand of clothing was too large, baggy and long. Additionally the coral color it appears to be in the picture doesn't actually look that way in person-it's more orange. Melon is actually the description which is more accurate. The shirt however is of high quality fabric and feels very durable and comfortable.",3
95799,"I LOVE these boots!  They are gorgeous and absolutely comfortable.  This is my first pair of cowboy boots, and I am hooked!  I was always hesitant to purchase a pair because I was worried they would not be comfortable.  I have worn these for the last two days and they feel like I have worn them for years.  I don't want to take them off!  Also, they look amazing.  The colors are vibrant.  Don't get these unless you want to stand out and collect lots of compliments!",5
49261,"This is exactly the idea I was looking for; however, I think my kids need these sewn on.  I have two young boys and everytime they put their coat on then tried to put their hands in the mittens the clasps would come off. Now,instead of gloves going to school and not coming home the gloves and clasps have dissapeared! I think these would be perfect for very young children or even girls that are not so rough on their clothes and such.",3
323331,"This is a great quality key purse. I can keep my drivers license and a couple of credit cards, along with coins and other things in the 4 zippered compartments. The leather is soft and supple. The stitching is tight and even. The zippers are stiched straight tight. This item is well worth the price and gets a 7 star BFTB RipRap Rating.",5
47795,"I have always had trouble with cold ears, even in the summertime.  So I tried these, and they are fantastic!  They keep my ears at an even temperature when I am riding my bike.  I couldn't ride without them! I'm so glad someone invented the spring-hold system......they really stay on.",5
494540,"Took a little longer than the typical 2 day prime delivery but boy was it worth it. So many band tees are made from whatever average level material. This shirt was crazy soft, graphics have that great vintage look, I love it. I'm honestly going to look at what other shirts the seller has because of it.",5
432652,"I think my daughters would have loved this shirt, had it fit in any way. I got a small youth and medium youth. I'm returning the medium, and I am going to wear the youth small. I am normally a size small adult, and the youth medium was big on me. I am ordering shirts for my girls elsewhere. Nice quality shirt, though.",4
391585,"Bought to train grandson to keep his glasses safe (because they were falling off his dresser at night and got stepped on a few times). He took to it right off and we haven't had any ""stepped on"" accidents since. Four stars because the cup part could be a wee bit taller but perfect condition otherwise.",4
298014,Got these yesterday and they fit well.  They feel a bit like a thick fitted sock and not so much like a compression material but I can see them helping it someone has minor pains while standing a lot or running with bad ankles etc. decent compressi N socks.,4
20917,Excellent sun protection! We've been traveling to sunny places and spending a lot of time in the water this summer. Bought this hat for our 1 year old (whose head is on the larger side) to protect him from the sun/sunburn. I like that it ties to keep the hat on then he is not able to pull it off. (He didn't like wearing it at first but now he doesn't mind at all) It keeps the sun off his neck and entire face. Highly  recommend!,5
383651,"These were a disappointment.  They fit nothing like the full-length leggings from the same brand.  They were tighter in the waist and the seams unraveled the very first time I wore them.  I should have returned them, because at this point the only way I can repurpose them is as a couple of expensive dust rags.",1
754761,"It's much larger and heavier than I expected, which is nice because it isn't hollow or cheap metal. I bought it as a gift so I can't comment on the wear and tear.

4 stars because the chain was obviously much more poorly made and is the type of that cheap stuff that turns your skin green.",4
872689,"I ordered three of these shirts for my friends and me as novelty for an extraterrestrial 10k race. They arrived on time and as expected. We haven't tried them on yet because the race is next week. However, they are bright (I ordered green) and should be fun for our post-race photo.",5
47268,"$16.95 is what I paid for it.  It's woefully not worth it.  At the very least it is functional and looks like what is pictured.
But it wasn't as warm as I wanted it to be.  The warmth is comparable to headphones.  It didn't fit well with glasses, a bike helmet, and certain hats as well.  At the very least, it didn't fall off, but adjusting head pieces, and glasses was difficult.  If you don't do any activities that require this like sports, I'd suggest you just get headphones.",3
125263,"This hat is not as large as one I had.  It may stretch, but it is not as big as I wanted it to be.  If you guys start making a xxl let me know.  I have to wear 3 or 4xlt shirts and 15 shoes so things that are too small are not a real big surprise.",3
2468,"It took several days to break these in, which was fine, I figured they'd last. I've had them  year now, and they need to be replaced. The soles lasted about 9 months before developing the first hole. The leather held up reasonably well, but the stitching is starting to fray. Probably not awful for the price, but the soles not even lasting a year sort of kills it for me.",2
366279,"Bought for a Disney themed party, and I've got no regrets. This costume is really great. Material doesn't feel cheap and there's a zipper, not Velcro, which is a big plus. The pic shows the dress going down to the knee, but it came to mid-calf on me. Sleeves were just a touch tight, but not enough to be annoying. The headband was super cute, but the plastic piece kept sliding a bit. I love this costume!",5
192925,"A cool idea. However I wouldn't recommend them. They hurt after not even a full day of wearing, I think they are made with cheap metal. Also, they are way too tight, for me particularly, the bars are too small. I would not have ordered them if I had noticed that. Haven't had much luck with this company. I won't be ordering from them anymore.",1
872202,"This print is very pretty and so is the style.  The problem is the material is like a windbreaker!  Weird and not a nice dress fabric.  If you roll the sleeves, then you will see the back side of the material which is white- so it has a very cheap feel.  I ordered the large and I am 5'7"" 150lbs and it fit fine, but I will be returning this as it is NOT what I expected.",3
397772,"I bought this for my son who loves dragons.  HE LOVES THIS RING. The pictures don't really do the ring justice, it has a very high quality appearance and a nice heft.  My sons loves showing his dragon claw ring off to everyone, and everyone thinks it's pretty groovy.",5
103801,"This is an adorable little bag, but the product dimensions say it is 9.3 inches wide, and it is less than 8 inches wide.  The bag is much smaller overall than the dimensions (and the price) would indicate.  I bought it, even at that price, because I wanted it to go with the LeSportsac Mcscotty Weekender bag for a gift.  I never would have bought it I had known how small it was.",1
513705,"Oh my goodness! My daughter takes her bag everywhere! It is the perfect size for school, church, or just going with friends. She loves her Traveler bag. It hangs perfectly at hip level over the chest and shoulder so you don't worry about somebody grabbing it and running. It is so cute and stylish, and it goes with everything!",5
718515,"these are very comfortable, very flattering. they do slip down a little on me and give me just a tiny bit of saggy butt and actually felt a little smaller than I thought in the midsection however I just had a baby so I'm a little thicker in the middle right now. over all great pants and I love them!",4
266191,"I'm giving it a 4 because I LOVE the look of it, just disappointed that the arms were a little snug for my liking and i'm pretty average in size and even had my husband try it on and he's a slimmer guy and it was snug on his arms too.  Considering the word ""Loose"" is in the item title and the picture being used, makes it look more like a kimono/batwing type cover up.",4
74994,"This band has saved me so much time, money, and trouble. My pre pregnancy pants started getting tight at 2.5 months and the hair tie trick only works with tops long enough to cover the evidence. We weren't ready to announce and this band allowed me to wear my dress pants unbuttoned(!) discreetly at work for the past two months. I still don't have enough bump to keep maternity pants from slipping straight off and sagging so this has allowed me to keep wearing my clothing and I love that!",5
793566,"Love love love this! I'm four and a half months pregnant so I love having something that's high necked to play down my *ahem* pregnant boobs. I was nervous this would be see through, and it's not! Also I was scared the bottoms would be too revealing but they really aren't bad. Such a great deal! I feel like I hit the swimsuit jackpot!",5
37728,"I purchased these sweats to be sure they fit and were comfy, and they were perfect. So I reordered...two more... they arrived today...exactly the same only no pockets.  What kind of monster would even make sweatpants without pockets, let alone try to sell them? Who prefers no pockets? Real people? Pffft. Realy people like pockets, for phones, keys, wallets, bits of garbage to be thrown, kids stuff, you get the idea. No one wears sweat pants for fashion. Its all about comfort and utility. I am annoyed.",2
63246,"Fit a little large, so I ordered a size smaller(medium) and it fit nicely, loose even. Costume looked great and I got plenty of compliments. I'm a 34DD so I was worried about the top part, but it fit perfectly with a strapless self adhesive bra. Great for the price",5
288775,"Isn't this a nice picture of some lovely earrings? They reminded me of a flower - a flower whose name has escaped me. But what hasn't escaped me was my disappointment that what I thought would be my  low cost mood lifter upper was in fact 2 bobby pins with crystals from the dollar store glued on, and actually on one earring - falling off. Really bad.",1
394766,"I was surprised that, given the price, these actually work as advertised. They don't accumulate and retain nearly as much perspiration as my old standard cotton favorites (TMI?). I do own some expensive ""high tech"" underwear that perform noticeably better. But these are a great compromise for daily wear. They're comfortable, fit as expected, and come in solid boring colors. Just what I was looking for. I'll bump it up to 5 stars if Fruit of the Loom ditches the giant logos on the waistband.",4
613040,"First of all, it's a one-piece.  It's a really nice bathing suit, but just too small in every way possible.  I usually err on the side of caution and go a size up, and it was too tight and too short.  Pulling the straps over my shoulders cut off circulation to my arms.  Fortunately, there seems to be no issue returning it.",1
475246,"Definitely got what i paid for haha. Color is a lot lighter than pictured and the straps are pretty thin. Not the regular thickness you would get with normal suspenders. the overall feel was real cheap. I know for a fact they're only going to last a few wears before the color fades and the buckles break. If you need an actual pair of suspenders, spend the money and get a decent pair, these will not suffice.",2
93925,"Ive decided to return them since the stitching and the sewing isn't as good as I though they'd be, some stitching on the finger tips seems loose and the parts Where leathers were joined together has some rough edges . The chrome plate of the Gloves looks too loud  and I would prefer a more low profile and warmer gloves for the fall riding season. for this price you could get a more Well known brand with better quality.",2
744401,"Nice tam at a great price, though the velvet is a little rougher than I like.  I did not find it small as other reviewers did. Fit was fine and comfortable on my size 7 1/2 head. Would have liked to be able to change the tassel, but it's nice enough as it is.",5
55099,I bought this ring for my husband and he can't stop raving about it.  He is NOT one for jewelry and doesn't like the gold or diamond wedding bands.  This was so original I knew he'd love it but didn't expect him to LOVE it the way he does.  Highely recommend this ring.  Very confortable.  The picture doesn't do it justice.  I found the same ring at other sites for $300.  The low price at this site is beyond belief.  Beautiful ring!,5
368048,"Update: After losing one of the original tunnels,  I decided to order a new pair. I have to say, I love them just as much as the first time! They are simple, yet effective, and feel like I'm not wearing anything in my lobes. It's wonderful. If you are sizing up, or simply want something light and easy to maintain your gauge, these are perfect!

Original: They've been great as a backup pair. I usually wear wooden plugs but once in a while I like to change it up. They do exactly what they are supposed to do.",5
591318,"Medium fits the same as 15-1/2 32-33. It's also more of a dressy-casual shirt than a dress shirt (shorter length, no spot for collar stays.) Also, there are darts on the front that run right about to my nipples. I think this looks kind of strange but it is what it is. It's not a bad shirt by any means, and I'll keep it as a more casual shirt, but it doesn't really work as a dress shirt.",3
538250,Did not realize that this was shipping from China and nothing in ad pointed to that.  Item was as described and is beautiful but was a gift and seemed to take a great deal of time to arrive (well past birthday).  It did in fact arrive within window as promised.  I would buy again from this seller but give extra time for shipping,5
875015,I got this for my husband and he loved it BUT it wasn't very functional and couldn't hold his 4 cards so I ended up getting him another more practical one. For what it is though he loved the quirkiness of it because hes a bit of a nerd :) Its a really cool concept and sleek looking product but not very functional.,3
67947,"Love my new backpack/purse. Just the right size. Nice leather that is not too stiff. Fits/contours nicely against my back. Lots of little zip pockets for different things. Do have 2 negatives. The little metal pieces on the bottom straps are square and dig into my side if I am only wearing a shirt without a jacket. Second, I wish the side zippers for the 2 side pockets zipped the opposite way. Seems like it would be more secure for any dishonest people you might bump into. Overall I would buy this again in a heart beat.",5
682295,"It is a cheap product. The problems is that it looks and feels cheap. These kind of caps are expected to be easily adaptable to any shape of head with no problem. Not this one, Some kind of flaps form at the sides, as if there was extra material; simply not well designed.",2
742749,"I am usually a size 12 dress size, I have a 38 D cup size so I ordered the XL dress. The dress absolutely has NO room for any kind of chest. If you have any type of bosom DO NOT ORDER this dress. I am going to return. Other than that it was cute.",3
607655,"I love the design on these shoes obviously. They are decent quality, not the best but that is what I expected with the price. They are comfortable. I usually wear a 71/2 to 8 in womens and these shoes fit my feet exactly. I am a little disappointed that after just a couple times wearing them that the seahawks design at the bottom of my feet is already disappearing . So all in all I do like them but it would be nice if they were a better quality.",3
120615,"I needed this item for my daughter's swim class. It is super cute and fits well. She's 3-1/2 and I bought her one that fits 3-4 years of age. She's a little on the small size, but tall so fits just fine with room to grow. I would recommend this swim diaper.",5
508448,"Item arrived very quickly.  Really nice quality fits perfect.  In-fact I was a bit afraid that it would not fit because my husband is pretty tall (6'3"") and has a long torso so I thought this may be short on him but to my delight it fit him perfectly.  He loves it and it will look great at the formal wedding we are attending next month.  Thanks for a great product at a very affordable price.",5

678044,"It's amazing. Print is nice. Only flaw is it's a tad short and the armpits are a little tight. I'm 5'1, have DD cup size, and am usually a large in most things. I ordered the XXL and it's still a little tight in the arms and I will DEFINITELY need to wear tights with this.",4

I have plenty of other similar leggings from other brands that I've purchased in this same size, and they fit fine.  I am in the process of losing weight, so maybe this will help motivate me?  Kind of.. whatever, but they look cool.  Can't wait to wear them some day!",3
343057,"Currently wearing a 1x or 2x depending on the cut. I ordered this in a 1x thinking I was ordering a size down but it was still large on me.
I LOVE the pockets and the comfortable fit. The material is a nice moderate knit, not light and cheap feeling. They look great with jeans and tights and although casual, the trim and detail make it okay to wear to work if you can do business casual.
I ordered three more in different colors in L and they seem to fit perfectly, even after washing.",5
626050,"First thing I ordered a white outfit and received a black and white one, then I did not realise that the shorts was flared. I thought it was my mistake on ordering so I went back to the outfit again, tried to order the all white outfit and the black and white came up again. Unhappy",1

Pants have two different tags sown  on it one says Large the says X Large. I tried them on, they fit like a small!
I'm guessing they are using small children to size for adult clothing.  So disappointed, needed these for an event, too late now.",2

If you have large feet, these are not the product for you, or ensure that you are able to get the appropriate size.

They will, however, work for my needs (gym showers), and I'll deal with the... ahem... small footprint.",3

It runs small, so we didn't get to use it for as long as we had hoped, and my son is only in the 40th percentile.

79877,"The colors and style of this dress were perfect. My only complaint is that the cut of the fabric around the bust is not great. In the picture, the models breasts fit in the top of the dress perfectly. But on bustier women, the line cuts off before the bottom of your breasts.

Though the product description probably said they have no pockets, I wish now that they had pockets (or that I had ordered shorts with pockets).  The mesh seems to breathe well, but it also leaves them feeling like less of a short than I was expecting.  I'm not suggesting that they are not a good short for the right person/purpose, but I would not buy them over again.",3
199712,I am so happy I decided to purchase this ring!! It is gorgeous. Very dainty and petite- but perfect for what I wanted it for :)  for the price you need to buy it!! The picture doesn't even justify how sparkly it is It may not look 100% real but it's definitely cute to look at.

Overall, I like it. It looks nice. I just don't love it compared to the other dresses I own.",4

644384,"The back of this dress is really cute, and I like the cut. My only issue is that there is some bunching at the neckline, so if you don't pull it down it looks a little cheap. Not a big issue though for the price. Also the shipping was really fast!",4
172497,"These dresses are great for summer.  Lightweight yet substantial material.  I ordered two prints.  This one in Large and another in XL.  Both fit but I prefer the XL because I like the extra room especially in the summer.  Buy one (or more)., you won't be dissatisfied.",5
867106,"I love the dress but I ordered a size large and it is still too short. I am 5'9"" and 120 pounds and it was almost like a longer shirt. I recommend buying a size or two larger than regular wear. The dress looks just like the picture though, super soft, and very flexible, I LOVE IT!",4
575518,"I ordered something very similar to this from the app Wish, what you find here you can also find there, I got it for my honeymoon, needless to say it is nothing like the pic, it was a shapeless apron with two triangles for the boobs and the thong was loopsided... How that is possible I'll never understand.",1
273558,"The fit of this was a bit off: 1) It put pressure on my eyelids. It should sit on your cheekbones instead. It made it really uncomfortable and I didn't end up wearing it. 2) some of the whiskers went through my field of vision. I had to cut them with scissors. 3) Maybe my eyes are closer together than I realized, but the eyes on this mask were a bit wider than my eyes sat.

Giving it 3 stars because it was a good quality mask, but apparently not right for my face.",3

791314,"I would like these socks a lot more if the top band was wider and the toes were less tight. I these socks push my toes together too much, which causing bad ""toe posture"" and the top band is not very wide, so it leaves a painful indent at the top of the sock. I wish the toe and top band fit more like the highly recommended Physix brand; however, to be fair I do find this brand to have higher breathability, more fun design-wise, and a better price.",3
107118,"Honestly, I was already feeling the pinch in my wallet and was unsure if I wanted to shell out more money for this box. I am sure glad I did. The box is red, which isn't my favorite, however it looks great. The light is perfectly angled and nice and bright. Completely worth the money.",4
185944,"The model in the picture seems to show that there isn't much of a gap between the top and bottom, but on me the highwaisted bottoms do not go much past my lower portion of my hips. It seems to fit appropriately like not too tight or too big, but it just doesn't fit like the model at all (no surprise there right haha!) The fabric is also very thin and sort of scratchy.",2

She told me to keep buying them for since Aid ThroughnTrade helps the people for a better life and better working conditions.

We always welcome more colours to choose from.  Please keep up the good work.,5
522949,This top is Cute yes. But gosh it is so cheap! Cheaper than Debs if anybody knows what that is now and days. For the price I should not of expected more. Don't get me wrong looks just like the picture just cheap! Sad wish it was made better. I'm a xsmall/small. For this in a small. Fits good on that end!,3
474540,"I am 5'5 150lbs and I ordered a large. This sweater is way too small, the sleves are too short. Sweater is poorly made, the buttons are very cheap plastic. I should have read the reviews before buying. Unless you have the body type of a 12 yr old the sweater will be to small.",1
650810,"I ordered this to use as a prop in a musical, and it was absolutely perfect. It looked realistic, but was nice and light. It suffered some major abuse by the villain who used it onstage, night after night, and it held up perfectly. It doesn't bend when you hit it against something, but it was light and safe to have onstage. Because it doesn't have any significant weight to it, you'll have to use some acting/combat skills to make the use realistic. It it safe to use with kids or a Halloween costume as well.",5

Since it is a one-size, i had to adjust the waist and a little long for me because I am size small 0-2 and 4'11"". Added padding to the top, after those, wore it several times, and used for personal photo shoot.

I would absolutely order from this vendor again, the turn around time coming from China was quick, accompanied by a thank you letter along with any concerns about their product they wish for any feed back if you weren't satisfied.  I ordered three different Slouch Beanies from same vendor, love all three!  Thank You, Elaine Accessories!",5

I did think the texture and feel would be a little thicker--this is super thin and transparent.  Other than that its really cute and it arrived a much earlier than anticipated.",4
133906,"The material is very thin and completely see through. Everyone will be clearly able to see what you have underneath. The material is also not very stretchy so if you are larger than a US sz 4, I don't think these would fit. The sizing is more suitable for teens than adults.",2

It shipped in a padded envelope from Malaysia to USA, so I was worried it would be in pieces; however, it arrived whole. My tiniest complaint is the back had one spot that mildly irritated bare skin. I wore it for an afternoon against my skin and it was a little prickly, but no redness or green skin reaction when I took it off. Next time I wore it over a crew neck tee, so no more irritation. I wear it often, and have received many compliments.",5

603933,I bought two of these to hold small cosmetic and bathroom items for my daughter and I.  Mine leans a bit to the side but still does the job. The smaller size is perfect as we have very little counterspace in both bathrooms. I have owned mine for several months now and it is holding up well. My daughter uses hers for nail polish and she loves it.,4

The top part of the dress is excessively large and the last layer of fabric on the bottom of the dress is a completely different tone of brown when compared to the rest of the dress and the fabric on this last layer is also a completely different type of fabric.

I purchased one for my husband but he said he won't use it because it's not large enough to put his money in it.,4
370517,Guess I should have read the one star reviews before I purchased going by product description alone. THESE ARE NOT SIZE 4!!! I used a ring sizer before purchase to be sure and size 4 was a perfect fit. These however will not even go past the tips of my fingers. They fit my pinky and that's it. They are probably a size 3 or even smaller.,1

I'm hoping that a small will work, because I really love this coat. I'm doubting that these are actually Asian sizes, though. They seem very similar to US sizes.",3

The last 2 times I've purchased, I couldn't help noticing that the fabric is thinner and has less stretch, and thinner bands around the legs.

93421,"I really like these, they are very pretty and very much my style. The peg is not too big and shouldnt be too big for your ears unless you just got them pierced or just don't wear earrings often. They are really light, and are real wood. They take a little practice to get in, but if you leave the peg in the first hole and then slip it on your ear you have a lot more control of where the peg goes and it is easier to put it in your ear.",5

It now looks like velcro and any tiny piece of lint or hair sticks to it.",2

They are terribly uncomfortable. The fabric is itchy,  they gather at the back of the knee and cause rubbing, and don't breath at all (I have to change underwear after I take them off).

Then I put them on and the top seam ripped out completely on the first one, and the second one! after a few washes, the color started to get spotty, (almost as if bleach were spilled on them) after a few weeks of wear, they started to loosen up and roll down my bicep.

739855,The fit ran a bit small and the buttons are not really quality snaps. They are super weak and the slightest tension in fabric opens them up. It's an endless nightmare re-snapping them closed every 5 min. That's not including the snaps that came loose from the clothing due to poor stitching. Save the money and spend a bit extra on something of higher quality. Trust me.,1

805195,Came today sooner than I thought. The dress is beautiful the material may be slightly different than the one in the picture but still very happy. IT IS LONG  should probably completely customize to ensure length is right for your height otherwise extremely happy love the dress and I feel beautiful in it.,4
115320,"I love the look of these, but they have already broken in multiple places. They lasted a couple of weeks before something happened to the lenses and now I get weird reflections. Next, there was a crack in the frame. This is the second time I've bought these sunglasses, and now I've decided to buy real Ray Bans. Hopefully I won't have to replace those every few months!",2
486000,"Two of the blue pieces were off when I opened it. It is also a solid metal back. No gaps like it appears in the picture (that could be better I guess). The clasp was bent and in poor condition. The blue is a lot darker in purpose, almost black. Cheap price so no point in returning. A little super glue and a new string or chain and it will be good to go.",2
461241,"Super comfortable.  Some brands of boxers are sized 34-36 for a Medium.  If you need a 36 waist, you need a Large in these, so just be careful to check the actual size you need.  Fabric is very soft and waistband is very comfortable.  They hold up great to many, many washings.",5
238564,"It's pretty but the front opens more than the picture and hangs down, but it still works. It also does not support my tatas too well, but I am only a 32 in bra size so I may take in the neck a bit to give it more of a pull so it will hold them better. It is cool looking, material is very nice.",4
45741,"I love this bodysuit! I just wish I had bought a large.  I am 5'10"" and 140 lbs. I got a Medium, but it was too tight in my torso (I have a long torso anyway) and felt too stretched. I wish I had bought a large. Also, the material is thin but comfortable. No insulation or lining.",5
16580,"Ordered the marine blue, however I received a ""mostly"" blue pair with a Brazilian flag on the strap and a blue, green, and white striped sole...will be returning. Always disappointing to receive something other than what you ordered. I was looking forward to taking these with me on vacation, but sadly won't be able to now.  :(",1
233998,Some of the tapers do not match up to the plugs and instead of pushing the plug threw right after the taper I had to leave it in for a week before it would even try to go in I also cleaned them and all the shinny colorful paint came off and got stuck in my ear and had to go to the Dr and get it cut out cause it got stuck so not to happy with the product love the colors and the look but all in all not a great product for me,1
646152,"I bought this so nervous about the sizing. I'm 5'1 and 140 lbs and ordered a medium. It wasn't to short and wasn't too long and was very slimming. The material is a bit stretchy throughout the dress, but not too much in the arms. The material is semi thick amd very sturdy. I'm very happy with this dress.",5
739899,"not the same color as the picture it's a pink not really a pastel looking pink like it looks in the picture ,but very soft and warm, and if you want this to be a big sweater get a size larger mines a bit to small and i ordered a medium which is my size.",2
106177,"The dress knit is a little loose.  The collar is serged directly to the dress and the serged edge is not finished or tacked properly to the dress, which makes the serged seam show unless you iron it in and then tack it properly yourself.  It looks cute on, the quality of workmanship is just lacking.",3
441649,"First off, I'm 5'4"" and around 127 pounds and the size medium fits well.  I don't know if I would call these ""elegant"" as it says in the product title...the material is basically just shiny and actually thinner than I was expecting and I'm not real sure how well they will hold up. However I still think they are fun and cute and I'm looking forward to wearing them :)",4
696693,"I opened the package to find that the letter ""G"" had a nasty brown circular stain amid the perfectly white background. Thank goodness I was able to get it off and it's completely unnoticeable now. I couldn't understand how it was packaged with such a noticeable mark on it. The size is somewhat large, but as commemorative gear it'll do.",3
141677,Love this bag!!! I own a lot of bags and this one has to be one of my favorite.  Its the perfect size if you love big purses and its great quality.  Scarleton is my new go to for bags from now on. Already shopping for my next one.,5
586560,"GORGEOUS and very flattering cut. I got so many compliments on this coverup in Jamaica. the color is lovely and the material is very breathable. I'm super picky but it was  great value and the perfect length. I'm 5'3 and it hit about 3-4 inches above the knee and is true to size, stretchy, so order down if you are between sizes.",5
121300,"Very cute hat, nice quality, but when I ordered a newborn size I expected it to be much smaller. My new born just about drowns in it. But, I put it on her in her stroller and the brim is so big it shades her whole face, I just have to keep it tucked behind her head.",4
342013,"I ordered this piece because I love the idea of it...as well as the looks.
I did receive this bracelet on time. Thank you for that.
With that said...
As awesomely cool as this item does look, sadly it's not made of sound quality.
The bracelet is really flimsy; delicate like; not sturdy.
3 days later, one of the wings fell completely off, right out of the ball.
I later found the wing on the floor. I cannot reattach it because pieces are still missing.
And lastly...the clasp. Ugh. It was near impossible the get it to close.
~meh~",2
35334,"These are great little cheaters.  Since they are inexpensive you don't have to worry about losing them.  And if you have a big stupid slobbery dog like I do, breakage is not so traumatic.  Plus you get enough that you can stash them around the house (car, purse, RV, boat, batmobile, dog-sled, treehouse, whatever).  I will probably order this a couple times a year when I start running low!",5
369932,"These were great, the only reason I gave them four stars is one pair had a screw that came out I guess during shipping and I was unable to use that pair. The other reason is more of a personal one.. my ears are super sensitive to materials that aren't real. I can only wear these for about a full day until my ears get weary. BUT they look really cute and look like gauges.",4
148594,"I love this nightgown. At 5'11, 184lbs @37 weeks (38B/C), and drying it on the the wrong heat, it is starting to get snug. I got the size large. I will follow up in a month or so once I actually try nursing in this nightgown and will update if it shrinks anymore. I suspect that it will fit fine as I'll be sans belly. I'm probably going to buy 1 more.",5
655637,"This is a beautiful dress, however it runs almost 2 sizes to large. It washes up nice and the fabric is gorgeous. Very pretty and feminine especially for us large women. I love mine even though it is way too big. I wear it around the house but if it wasn't so big l would wear it anywhere. I would buy another just like it in a smaller size but they are out. Hope they get some more soon.",5
822253,"Beautiful dress - so figure flattering.  I am a size 6 and wear a size small to medium in dresses.  I ordered the medium and it fit like a glove, however it was way to tight on my chest (I am a 34 DD).  I ordered a large to see if it would fit my chest better, but hoping it will not be too big through the body....I will keep you posted.",5
193208,"I ordered these shoes when the previous model of inov8s I had finally got too old and worn out. I assumed that since they were the same shoe just a newer model the fit would be fairly comperable. When I tried them on I could feel the plastic diagonal lines along the inside of the shoe pressing into my foot. I tried wearing them 1 day hoping that they would get more comfortable, unfortunately no such luck. I may have ended up with a fluke model but they are so uncomfortable that I have not worn them since.",1
104392,I usually wear a size 16 but bought a size 18 for comfort.  Excellent fit from waist to length.  Little more modest because of the slightly longer length than some swimming skirts I have pitched in the past.  Excellent Quality.  I have worn this in the Pool and washed in Washing Machine with cold water and dried in Dryer on low heat without incident.  Great Summer Purchase.,5
187366,"Look if you want bask in that summer spirit with a style that every one associates with a great time at the beach, then this is the shirt for you.  Fits great and material is nice and light for this summer heat.  Reasonably priced and works great for office attire or just casual dress situations.",5
346578,"I'm a male with largish hands and these BARELY fit. They're on the thin side and there are a couple strings hanging where it is sewn together, but nothing bad for the price and they do the job (which is get and keep my hands warm).

Texting with these gloves on is like not even wearing any at all so that was a real plus!",4
414043,This pendant is just beautiful and looks more expensive than I paid.  I have a silver chain and you wouldn't tell that the pendant didn't come with this chain.  I have been looking for a turquoise ball pendant to match the earrings my daughter bought for me and the stone is the same design and color.  Great buy!!  Amazon is the best on-line store.  Have had no problems with their site.,4
222433,I love these rings! They are absolutely beautiful! I expected the stones to be loose but they are excellent! And not only that but they have great costermer service! One of my rings was broken when it arived so i emailed them and they responded to all my emails within an hour or two and sent me a replacement ring after i gave them pictures of the broken ring!,5
578730,"I loved these the first day, but then ... I have a Maine Coon cat, she's beautiful, she's big, and she's uber hairy.  This catches every single one of her hairs.  After they got stretched initially ... they kept falling down on me and I'm a pretty average size calf.  They are warm.  I washed them in the washer a few times, and dried in the dryer ... still they fell down after I used that first time ... I will have to wear these over my pant legs in the winter in the future.",3
864134,"Love this wallet, had to upgrade because I am getting a new phone and it won't fit in the old one. I searched all over for a style I liked better than this one and just couldn't find one. Love all the card slots and separate spaces for cash and your phone. Shipping was fast.",5
493089,"I really do like this sweater. The colors are as bold as i was expecting and the sleeves fit fantastic. The only this i would say is it's a little shorter in the torso than i was hoping for or expecting, but i love how warm it is! I get complimented every time i wear it. !",4
105055,Too small!! Very very disappointed in this top. I bought a medium and I've bought from allegra before in a medium and fit great. The size chart is WRONG for this item. The top took 1 month to get here not hqppy about that. But it is cute and would look good if I had gotten a size up. I will prob donate or I will have to lose 20 lbs to fit me.,2
691199,"The wig was very cute and curly but was VERY SMALL. Wigs are usually a tad bit tighter on my head but this one was outrageously tight, I had to cut slits in it to expand it a little. The bangs were long enough to go past my chin but cut easily. I applied head via hair dryer and round brush to ""fluff"" the bangs and part of them melted off. It gives a good look and is decent for the price.",3
326103,"The bracelet is pretty cool overall. It takes a while to get used to getting the hair ties on, but after it's mastered, it's fairly easy. The bracelet itself is bendable and easy to mold, fitting for most hair elastics. It also comes with a little black bag. I gave this item four stars because although it is easy to bend, it comes originally in a completely circular shape and it was hard to bend it to fit my wrist. Other than that, it's a good purchase for a good price.",4
518490,"It's small, I won't ever put it in the dryer.  Luckily I have a US size S-M upper torso.  Love the color, love the style in back.  The pictures don't do it justice, but the front droops longer than the back.  Very cute.  Not sure of it's durability yet, but for the price, it doesn't matter if I can get a couple wears out of it.",4
787406,I bought it as a present for my friend. She totally loved it. I was a bit afraid that the quality won't be as good as it seem on the picture but to my surprise the T-shirt is really cool and not the cheap type that you wash once and it gets all funky. I totally love this product.,5
339821,"Beautiful colors and breathable material, but the L is definitely a medium and the XL is a Large. I wish they had XXL when I ordered because I want to be comfortable with a sport bra underneath. Also I ordered all XL and they gave me one L and two XL. So my order was uneven. For reference, I am full-figured, 5' 8' , size 14, medium chested.",3
693869,"I love these.  All of my Converse shoes, 4 to be exact, have these on them.  I've reused U Laces for one pair of my Converse.  They are awesome.  I'm baffled that people actually say theirs broke.  I'm curious if they bought the kiddie version.",5
174263,The womens floral two piece  was to  small i ordered a large and I wear  a medium  . Its made for kids. I couldn't  even get the bottoms on past my knees and after i ordered it i started  reading reviews having the same problems.,1
75065,"I bought this belly band to assist with wearing my work pants that currently still fit in the butt and thigh region, but not around my growing belly. The fit is just as I thought it would be. The belly band is very comfortable, and keeps my pants up without feeling like i have to adjust the band all day long. It's worth the $28 to spend on the band to avoid having to buy work pants (which is already a task for me!) for my last pregnancy.",4
531670,"Watch was okay, but is not resetting randomly.  Sometimes in the middle of game, losing game time - critical issue.  Don't get, manufacture is Chinese, no warranty information available on website and gives an international number to get support.  Do yourself a favor and get a watch from a local manufacturer.",1
75289,"I love these- I ordered it in three colors and they are just the absolute best! I got them when I first was getting to big for my regular sized pants, and they worked beautifully holding them up- though required a little adjusting here and there. Now in my 8th month of pregnancy, I sometimes wear them just to help support my belly and they really do help alleviate some of the pressure. I highly recommend these for any and every pregnant woman!",5
121100,"This hat seems like it had been redesigned from their last years version and I love it! The brim is very stiff and stays out of my daughters face well. She wouldn't wear a lot of other wide brimmed hats because they kept falling in her face and this seems to have solved that problem! The print is absolutely adorable! I wish they made one in my size :). Over all, and i highly recommend and of the iPlay hats of this style.",5
483982,It looks great and feels so soft but Don't wear with a light colored shirt.  It sheds like crazy.  My husband wore it with a white work shirt and by the time he got to work and took off his coat the shirt was covered with black fuzz.  We have tried washing and nothing helps.,1
674206,"I got this for my 14 and 16 yo, I try not to spend much on my teenagers' jackets/hoodies as they tend to tear them up, loose them or grow out of them in a few months.  The quality was better than expected, very soft and thick! Great bargain and my teens approved.  I ordered 2 sizes up after looking at the other reviews, only needed to order 1 size larger.  This is probably better suited for a petite build, lady, teenager etc.",5
729677,"These are pretty cool if you are looking for a new twist on Active fashion. They are much tighter around the calf and ankle than traditional athletic pants. It's like skinny jeans meets athletic wear with a Euro/Asian twist. One of my sons who is more of a husky/athletic build did not feel as comfortable in these, however, my extremely tall and lanky son fit in these perfectly and was able to move freely. The material is very durable and high quality. The stitching is also very durable. Very cool!
Product was discounted in exchange for Review and Testing Purposes.",5
340935,"I took a plunge with these, as the other reviews stated some had been received with holes. I'm rather handy with a needle and thread so I figured I'd give it a shot. Happily, no holes. The length is great. I'm 5'8"" and I've still got a little extra. They are somewhat sheer, but I also have thick thighs, so this happens to me a lot. They are soft and very comfortable. I have complete range of motion. :-) Definitely recommend.",5
815715,"My daughter loved this swimsuit it was the talk of her 8th birthday party.. Mermaids vs. Pirates.. Fit true to size, now i can't get her to wear any of the other swimsuits i bought prior to this one.. LOVE IT... It is great quality .. better than i expected",5
150161,"It's an amazing jacket. Very good quality. It's just bigger than I expected. I'm not American, and went according to the size chart on here. I got a large, and I think a medium would have been perfect. But apart from it being a bit too big, I love it!",4
216305,"I'm an older guy who has had more than enough sun over the years on my face and the back of the neck.  I spend pretty much every weekend out all day fishing, and thought this would be a good sun hat.  It is awesome.  It might not be the most stylish hat as the brim is pretty large, but I was looking for function and not style here.  But I think it is quality made, has lasted, and I would definitely buy again.",5
709167,"The service from Think Out Loud Apparel was prompt, arriving in 2-days via Amazon Prime's 2nd day free delivery.  The material quality seems good and the shirt fits like any other large.  The printing is sharp, clear and centered.  What else is there to say?  Love the shirt!",5
401898,"I bought this for my girlfriend a few months ago as a just-because gift and she loved it! She almost thought it was real at first and I felt bad when I had to tell her it wasn't. She wears it when the occasion calls for something big, even if it isn't 'real'... :) It's a great looking ring for the price... I definately recommend it!",5
719494,The ring is amazing! My husband got it for me as a upgrade from my old ring. Pink camo is my favorite color and to see a ring like the one I have on is awesome. The sizing fits perfectly and the color is popping. Everyone that sees me loves my ring.,5
827974,I bought this for a high school student. The bag was made from nice material. It didn't seem cheaply made. The zippers all work properly. There is alot of space inside and pockets on this backpack. This is the main reason it was purchased. The straps are adjustable. So far the backpack has held up but it has only been used now for about 2 days. I will update if my opinion changes after a little wear and tear. The received product was true to the description and arrived within the time frame it said it would.,4
693140,"Lightweight and comfortable. I got a large because I usually wear a size 8, have broader shoulders and bigger arms. Fits great, no issues with sleeves being too short or arms being too tight. Zipper is a bit stiff but I usually wear it open. Flattering cut and not too short on the torso. Nice jacket for the price.",5
44122,"I must admit that this is a really cute boots, my son like it alot. Unfortunately after wearing for 2 months (only rainy days and snow day and less than 20 mins /day). The little fire at the back of the boots were completely torn out. One of the side of the boots was torn as well. This just can't last for a season. If this is $10, then fine, but for $27, i expect better quality.",2
482345,"I ordered these because I kept developing blisters if I went barefoot in my Vibram FiveFingers EL-X. The sizing is perfect and slips in my size 41 easily (I bought M-L size toe socks). The socks barely take up any spaces although it might make your foot slide around your shoe more. Besides that, I love wearing FILA toe socks as opposed to going barefoot and having to wash everyday",5
414327,"I bought this necklace back in 2011, I don't wear it as much these days but the necklace is in wonderful condition. When I first got it I wore it everyday and rarely took it off for two years. The metal is still shiny and the chain hasn't rusted. Overall, the necklace looks brand new still.",5
198244,This product is amazing. The seller ebuddy is so helpful and the product got here early and answered all my questions very promptly. I will definitely be buying another suit by them! I ordered a medium and the bottoms fit perfectly but I am a 34B and the top is definitely a bit roomy. But I love the suit the colors are amazing and the material is really nice. Overall a better experience than I had expected!,5
327035,"I got this for my husband who wanted to go to a smaller and lighter wallet.  He has been using it for about week.  He loves it. He uses it for cash, his license, and two credit cards. It holds strong even with varying amounts of cash.  It is a strong clip.  The only weight comes from what you put in it (the clip essentially has no weight).  He often forgets he has anything in his pocket (whether suit pocket or jeans pocket).  Good buy so far.",5
431709,"The ring is so chic and I could tell right away that it was made of real 10k gold and real stones, as the stones are very shiny and sexy. ""10K"" is marked on the ring that verifies Peora is a real jeweler. It also came with a lovely light purple jewelry box. Thank you. I'll definitely buy jewelry again at Peora.",5
807482,"THIS IS MY FAVORITE HEADBAND! My baby girl looks so cute with it. I was gifted this, but I'm really glad I was. Just picked up a few more from this brand. My only complain is the bow slides out of the loop when my 10mo old tried taking it off, at that point I'm afraid to use! Would probably glue on. Highly recommended for this price. Well worth the cuteness!",5
359458,"This was a nice wallet, except the velcro has already fallen off after only a few weeks of use.  Also, foolishly I assumed it would have a zipper spot for change.  No such luck.  That was my own fault for not looking closely enough....but just an FYI.",3
590457,I ordered the 50ddd since my 54ddd I was swimming in and the 50 is tighter then I thought. The hooks come apart even from just tying a shoe. I got the back support but the cups are flat and come to a point in the side not in front not like ^ more like _/.,4
14243,"I have been wearing these a few weeks and I can't believe how well they have helped with my plantar fasciitis. I had bought several 'Dr. S' products, another similarly priced support that professed plantar help, but nothing worked until these. I was told by a podiatrist that I may need to wear them for six months or more before I am healed...regardless, what a relief!",5
96874,One thing i do recommend is getting the size smaller that the chart says on here. I had to send back once in order to get the correct size or go into a bike shop or something for correct measurements. saves you money compared to the higher end priced stuff.,4
204253,"I feel like these are what I have been looking for, for years. I like them, I really do. The only problem is, for both pairs, one earing holds on tight whereas the other one is easily unclipped. If I lightly flick one of them, it will open. The other one, however, holds on strong and doesnt fall off the ear randomly. Otherwise, looks good, feels good.",3
321357,"Can't review it.  CAn't order it.  I'm 6'4' and weigh 190 lbs.  I would buy a couple, just to have, but my sleeves are 36"", and chest is 44""; pants are 37 x 34.

I don't think these have been tailored for the rest of us North American men.",1
506623,These fit as expected since everyone said they ran small.  I normally wear a size 2 or 4 in pants/shorts depending on store.  I ordered the medium. I did have to move the button over to make the waist smaller but I do like these a lot.  I am going to order another pair.,4
239289,"Shipped fast. Very pretty ring for what you pay. I fell in love with it. But within 2 days of wearing it, I have had two stones fall out and the other stones are not placed correctly and are lopsided and looks like if I kept wearing it, all the stones would fall out. Would order again, but I'm afraid the stones will fall out of the new one.",2
403137,"I really -love- this boot, the only true issue is I already read that it trended small and ordered a size up. Sadly that wasn't enough so I'm having to do a replacement for a -further- size up(For context I normally wear a size 10, and I'm having to upsize all the way to a 12 to hopefully have relative foot comfort while wearing). The boot makes a lovely squeaking noise when you walk. So in summary I'm taking a star off for the sizes being entirely inaccurate to the general shoe sizing.",4
72237,Crocs are awesome but the size difference between 8/9 and 10/11 is crazy. My son is almost 3 and he can only wear his 8/9 crocs if he doesn't use the back strap but not for much longer. The 10/11 look like clown shoes on him right now and I don't see them really fitting for a long while.,4
34454,"I purchased this bag recently and absolutely loves it. There is a compartment for everything, and it holds an awful lot.  And the shades fit perfectly,as though I picked them out myself.  However , I would give it 4 stars because earlier today the top zipper broke. And while this is an easy fix, I'm hoping  this is not a recurring issue.",4
16862,"I love these flip flops because they do not hurt between my toes, as I live in Fl and wear them all year for long walks with my dog, go grocery shopping, etc. I have attempted to wear many others, and although they may be lighter and perhaps even more attractive, they are not as thick, comfortable and long lasting. I have bought SEVERAL name brand flip flops and always go back to Havaianas. I totally recommend them.",5
653478,"Beautiful!! My absolute favorite piece of body jewelry. The downsides, unfortunately, are that
1) after a while the bright silver wears off and reveals a dull brownish copper beneath, and
2) the bar has to be super long in order to twist on the loose wing without hurting yourself. If only it were fastened with an internal magnet instead of threading :(",3
36698,My only complaint with this product is that the strap to close it is made of the same plastic as the umbrella and is a snap closure (as opposed to velcro) which makes it very difficult to wrap and close as the plastic is not very stretchy.  It's very had from my kids to do themselves.,3
77762,"I loved the Upsie Belly for the first week. After only a week of use the velcro isn't staying fastened. I can still use it, but it seems I'm constantly adjusting it to make it tighter and to stay put. I doubt it will last the last ten weeks I need it to! Definitely not worth the expensive price tag!!!",3
481696,I ordered a size or two up based on other reviews. I've had this jacket for about a year now and it still looks and feels great. It's very lightweight and fashionable. I'm 5'9 150lbs and ordered a size Large. The jacket covers my rear-end and the sleeves are the perfect length.,5
75830,"I wear this thing almost everyday. I have to admit, I never used it to fit into my pre-pregnancy pants, but used it more to shape my growing belly and make me feel a little more secure. Would highly recommend this for those reasons, a pregnancy must-have! It was always confortable and I work it from week 10 until I stopped wearing real clothes :)",5
199631,"Wow!! What a beautiful rose quartz pendant. Nice size. I love the color of the rose gold chain and how it complements the pendant.  I adjusted my necklace by opening up the links on the necklace, removing about 2 inches with my pliers because it was too long, and I love how it looks now. It comes in a pouch inside of an adorable pink gift box. It makes a lovely gift. I hope to feel the benefits of wearing rose quartz soon. I'm very satisfied with my purchase. I will buy the amethyst pendant next .",5
329067,"As described, and would buy again. Scarf is soft. Colors are bright, and a true red.  I think it's a good length. I like my scarfs to be long enough to fold in half, pull through the fold and have enough length left to hang, and this scarf works perfectly. Very quick shipping, which is always a plus.",5
632683,"This is a nice little super affordable reproduction of the one ring! The engraving is super fine and cleanly done. I have one (18k gold plated) from Nobel Collection and it's has a horribly rough engraving on it! And it cost like $50-75 or something like that! It did come in a nice little wood box, but still...this one's a steal and you can get it in a size that fits if you want to wear it around. LOL",5
265666,I wear the 2.75 which are difficult to find in stores so this was perfect for me and the fact that there were four was a welcomed lagniappe as I misplace glasses. They are very well made and stylish. I liked them so much I ordered additional pairs to place them in various rooms and my car just to make sure I always can see. Thank you.,5
443580,Very nice waders for my 8 year old. He can probably grow into them over the next 2 and maybe 3 duck seasons. I expected them to be a little big and they are but not to big. Tip: go to lacrosse website and look at their size chart. It's pretty accurate. All my buddies were very impressed by the waders. If you have $400 to spend go to macks and they have a wader coat combo from banded. Otherwise these waders are a awesome value.,5
603304,"So i got this and immediatly returned it. I got the us medium like i do for every other thing i buy on amazon. But this fit too small. The appearance of the jacket was a little less appealing then the pictures showed. It's not a bad product, nor would I detour someone from getting it. But make sure you choose a large if you wear a medium.",3
678290,I bought these for my 2 year old son because they are the only ones that I could find that are 100% wool. They are wonderful and soft. They are soft and stretchy and I think will fit for quite some time.  He has worn a single pair all winter and no holes at all.  I bought my 5 year old son another brand because I just didn't want to spend the money on another pair of these and I completely regret it. They aren't half as nice despite having great reviews.,5
415688,"I love this bag. I got it to use for daycare items. Within 2 weeks, one of the straps came off. I will likely buy a new one when school starts because I'm not sure if it was the product itself or my rough and tumble kids. I was very impressed by the quality of the material as well. :)",4
326980,I've been using this for 3 months with 2 credit cards and two slightly thinner ID cards.  It's not uncommon for me to have 18 or 20 bills in the clip for a day or two as well.  It still holds tight with only one bill in it.  The flared out edge makes for pretty easy use once you get the motion down.,5
804021,"I love this suit.  It runs small though and while I normally wear a medium/large I ordered a 2XL.  There is a lot of room in the bust, so I would say this suit is friendly to busty girls.  The underwire is nice to help give some lift also.",5
374744,"As other reviewers stated, it's not a very functional design. The belt went in the loop easily once, but trying to loop it through a second time was just too much of a hassle. I count even get it through, giving up after about a minute of fighting. I returned this product.",2
253385,"Very nice, love the color! It fits my reading glasses, iPhone 6S with a slim case and a Popsocket stuck to its back, and a credit card case. I hang my keys on the outside of the purse. The Peacock Green color online matched the actual product. This is my first wristlet, and I like this one enough to likely purchase another in a different color.",5
855261,"This is one of my new favorite pair of lounge pants. It fits me very well and the quality of the material is very good.. Although they're a bit thin and not for frigid winter nights, it still feels good when worn over a layer of thermal pants. Shipping was fast. Thank you!",5
648257,"Wrong size! According to the size chart I was to order a 3XL. When it arrived weeks later, it did not only fit, it was comically too small. I wear a size 24 and my daughter, a size 12, could not fit in it comfortably. Asking for a return, the company does not offer shipping labels. Customer pays shipping back to China. As a compensation to keep it and avoid ""inconvenience"" the company offered 10%. I recommend not purchasing from the company.",1
152579,"I really expected these earrings to be horrible but for the price I took the chance well, so glad I did I am amazed at the look and the quality of the earrings they actually look like the picture only better this is a very nice surprise buy them u won't regret it",5
533577,"I bought of these in different designs to wear while I teach my English classes. They felt much smaller than a usual small, although admittedly it could have been the entire pie I ate in the days prior to trying them on. Anyway, they are a nice quality,  soft and pretty, so I ordered them again a size up. They fit great.",5
308665,"Nice soft leather wallet.
All stitches are well made; there were no visible defects anywhere.
Credit card and ID pockets have the right size, all slides in with ease, snug fit, but not too tight.
Nice zippered pockets that loose items such as a key, a pocket calculator or a Smartphone, secure from sliding out.
The leather finish its soft, very flexible, some wrinkles too it. I consider it to be a daily womens wallet.
It doesnt have the look and finish for a night event.
I receive this wallet at no charge, for me to test it.",4
310386,"I give one star because i can't give 0 stars... I have ordered  two size 20 skirts and i have received two 24-26 skirts. Poor quality. The black and white skirt is size 20, that fits me well, the red skirt is one of the two that i received from this seller... Two skirts from the same order / seller and they are from different brands.",1
482988,"I bought this as a gift for my fiancee and she love's it! Took a while to receive them but it came. The first pair was defective, the zipper was damaged. I wrote to them and they sent me the info to send it back hassle free! The new one took a bit longer but it came perfect.",3
730280,I ordered two sweatshirts one from another company in the US and this one that I didn't know was coming from china. Both in a 2x just to make sure it was big enough. The US one fit and was even a little baggy. I gave the Chinese one to a find who normally wears a small. This sweatshirt didn't fit her or her 8 year old petite daughter .,1
531512,"Beautiful ring!  Sizing runs small, so it is VERY important to order a size larger.  I wear a 7-71/2, so I ordered an 8, and it fits perfectly.  I wanted a big gold-colored ring that looks updated and stylish, and this is definitely the ring.  Very well made and highly recommended.",5
17020,"I ordered these for $12 in size 41/42 (11/12US). I ordered the 41/42 after hearing that these run extremely small. I normally wear a size 10US and these fit well. BEWARE, you must order these shoes a size or two larger than you normally wear. with that said, if you can get them cheap i would totally recommend them. The 100% pure rubber is thick and supple. They are comfortable and durable.",5
407782,"Besides being of the highest quality,being extremely bright and vividly attention-grabbing,this cap carries an extremely ACCURATE message...Since King Jesus""purchased""my life with the AWESOME""cost""He paid as He laid His life down at Calvary to cleanse me of Sin,I effectively(figuratively as well as LITERALLY)belong TO Him!!

11567,"I have moved this single pair from shoe to shoe for two years. They are looking pretty beat up now, but I have used them to travel Europe, climb around Pompeii, walk in New York City and walk gravel country roads.  My podiatrist ""customized"" one with a custom cut pad to correct a toe problem. I'm buying new ones today, even tho these aren't smelly!

It is very important to choose the correct model and size for your feet. These are not just foot cushions.",5
236876,"The shoes were a gift for my mother she still works doing house keeping at a college and she says these are the best and most comfortable work shoes she has ever worn. She's had several injuries to her feet and these shoes provide the comfort and fit she needs to put up with her feet pain. She's thinking of getting a 2nd pair just in case they sell out.

I can't write a review based on a delivery but I will say that these were lost during delivery and had a new pair delivered in 2 days.",5
499123,I WEAR A LOT OF HATS AND THIS ONE FITS BETTER AND FEELS BETTER THAN MOST.  IT IS ALSO A VERY GOOD LOOKING HAT THAT LOOK EVEN BETTER THAN IT S PICTURE.  IF YOU LIKE HATS THIS IS ONE YOU WILL WANT.  I LOVE THE M&P LOGO AS WELL.,5
601818,"Very cute dress! I love how the back is open, and the length is perfect. I am 5'8"" and it hits just an inch or two above my knees. I have these cute totoro stockings I wear with the dress and it's just adorable. The fabric is comfortable like a t shirt and makes me feel pretty.",5
17441,"I am wearing two of these rings right now with my wedding ring in a stacked-ring application. They are beautiful! My husband says, ""Wow, that's a lot of bling, but not in a bad way."" I have been wearing them for more than a month now and they are still sparkly and shiny. No tarnish and no discoloration on my skin. The slight variation in the diameter of each ring works well if worn together or seperate.",5
225585,"I may have a big head or a lot of hair, maybe a little of both, but I don't have any ""slouch"" in this hat.  Fits like a beanie for me.  I was looking for something with slouch in the back, but I still love these hats.  They cover my ears nicely and are very warm.  I could make them slouch if I don't cover my ears, but then what is the point of wearing the hat?",5
18583,"Disappointed. I bought 3 of these hats in 3 sizes and 3 colors. The cap part is a strange conehead type shape inside, not quite able to sit flat on my children's heads. They are very flimsy and don't hold their shape wet OR dry. I wish I could get my $36 back but they were all worn (once) before we realized how cheaply they're made.",1
294070,"Leaving a one star review because these are not leggings.  The material is so thin that you could never get away with wearing these, unless you wear them like tights with a dress or something over them.  Disappointing, as they are very comfortable and soft!  I'll wear them to bed and around the house, but that's it.",1
69280,"Wow... Just wow. I got this for the girlfriend, size small, 5 ft 4 in tall, 120 lbs. wears a size 4-5 typically, and man this is amazing. The top is a little big on her (B cup) but regardless this was fantastic. The skirt was actually very solid quality.",5
400884,"This bracelet was bought for me about 3-4 years ago by someone near and dear to my heart. It is heavy without being overly heavy and sturdy and just gorgeous. I wear it everyday, as a matter of fact I never take it off. It is just as beautiful today as the day I put it on. I recommend it highly!!",5
416825,"The 1st one I received had a flaw, a drop of glue or something on the back.  I returned it and got another one and like it very much.  However, the bale came apart when I opened the package.  I was able to put it back together.  Aside from that, it's very pretty, beautiful colors, and worth the price.",4
213644,"These belts are a lot cuter in person than as pictured. They are 42"" in length and have 6 holes. They definitely seem to be more for fashion than function, but for the price I'll let them live out there short lives as long as they last.
The variety and colors you get are nice especially for the price.  It serves its purpose.  I didn't expect them to be some fancy belts, and they aren't, but overall they are nice.  I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a few different belts for different occassions.",4
402842,"Great value, no joke.  These ties are high quality - nothing like some other amazon skinny ties I bought which are good for about 1 use (cheap crap made abroad most likely).  The  colors are pure, and the little cloth thing that holds the end of the tie behind the tie is well made.  They should last awhile.  When I bought them (approx $5/apiece, not sure if price has changed), they were a great value.",5
774570,"It looks great on the model but it is nothing like it.  From the bottom, it has some weird shape and I do not dare taking it out in public.  I did not want to return it because it's a hassle so I wear it as pajamas.  It is huge!",1
252748,"Purchased these for my 15 hr flight to Australia.
My feet always get swollen from only a 3 hour flight.
So I decided to get these and was happy they were so affordable.
Wore these on my flight to and from Australia and no swelling occurred.
I am a ladies size 9 1/2 and I purchased the large socks - they fit snug and comfortably, couldn't even tell I had them on.
I would definitely recommend these socks.",5
32986,"It looks great. I bought it to see what I'd get for the low price. It is however, not designed to protect a rider in an accident. The jacket is very lightweight as the leather is wafer thin and seems to be laminated to a flexible synthetic backing. This is a piece for a gal that wants to ""look"" like a biker chick while walking around at the local mall.",3
777058,"It definitely doesn't look like the photo. It's more of a scooped neckline, and the white crocheted/see-through band in the middle is just straight all the way around. It's still cute for the price and I'm sure I'll wear it around this summer. I just wish it actually looked like the photo.",3
608174,"They look nice in the picture, but item was defiantly not what was expected. VERY bulky, you can see glue that holds the ""pearl"" in. and the ""silver"" does not look nice, its dinged and poorly made. Not including the fact they don't unscrew. Defiantly a waist of money and my time.",1
346259,I LOVE this dress.  It was comfortable and made out of great quality fabric.  I ordered black (because black goes with everything) and have washed it multiple times...No fading or weird material stretching has happened.  It looked great with a pair of sandals that I wore to a festival.  This is a casual item not sure how much you can dress it up.  I was very happy with this find!!!!,5
91908,"The costume was quite inexpensive, but you don't quite even get what you pay for. I bought this for a Halloween party and ended up having to wear something else. It is made with very thin material and fits incredibly ackward on. It also had an odd type of material around the neck which is quite itchy.",2
582541,"Very disappointed, after only 2-weeks all three pairs of these are starting to fall apart. The stitching is coming out on two pair (seams opening up), and the third pair has a hole forming. They looked nice upon receipt, are soft and fit all three boys as expected, but the material is thinner than most of the other long johns we have. I hoped that since these stated made in the USA, they would be of high quality, but actually they are very cheaply made.",1
430514,"It was cheap, and it's a mala. It is made of rosewood, and it looks just like the picture. Only complaint is some of the beads are already dented/slightly chipped. Not a huge deal as I am sure after it is worn once or twice it will be even more dinged up.",3
253771,"I purchased this wristlet in gray. It was delivered right on time. So far, I really like it, even my mom said she likes it! This bag holds everything so well. This wristlet can fit my credit cards, money, iPhone 6s, and keys. I was so undecided on what color to purchase because I wanted gray, beige, AND powder blue. I may just end up ordering another one in a different color. I highly recommend this bag to anyone who is looking for an affordable, stylish wristlet. THANKS",5
431245,"Love these shoes. I bought the white ones in a size 2 last summer and now the off-white ones in a size 3 for this fall and winter.  Everytime my granddaughter wears them, people notice and comment on how cute they are. My grandaughter is walking now and they are great - no slipping and enough support and look adorable!",5
96194,"I ordered the Medium and this dress fits perfectly (I am size 6/8 US, 36DD)
The shipping took some time, but surely worth the wait.
I get soooo many compliments on this dress.  My only grief is the slit in the back -which I was able to tack with a little thread.  The material is a bit thin, but I wear a fitted undergarment to keep everything smooth!
Thank you!!",5
221826,"Very cool kids glasses, good quality.  I was not expecting much given the price, but these are well built glasses (not the cheap junk you might find in a convenience store).  They look just like real wayfarers, including the gradiated lens.

They fit fairly good on my 5 year old, I am not sure how they would stay on a three-year old's head.  They are probably better suited for older kids but work for the little one.

I had looked into buying some kids size Ray Bans, but these are a fraction of the price and are identical.",5
772045,"Very comfortable, nice medium thickness material, true to size. I wear Medium, but I like my clothes loose. I ordered Medium. It's nice and flows freely, I don't like when clothes are tight in my chest (36B). Has pockets!!
It does have some chemical smell, hopefully it'll go away after washing it.",5
287620,"I bought the turquoise one with the long fringes. Very poor quality. It's made ""baggy"" and not straight or A-line. The fringe part is just cut right off, there is no nice finished hem. I usually wear a size M/L on blouses. You can't really wrap this one on the front because it's a little small around the hips but open on the sides you can't really tell. I'm only keeping this because the fabric is so beautiful. The turquoise one is just a little bit darker in real than what the picture shows.",2
122929,"Wasn't anything I expected haha. I thought it was a normal shirt but when I put it on it was so so cute. I actually really like it. It'd be cute with practically anything. I'd like it to be thicker material so it doesn't rip fast. But let's hope it doesnt. Either way. Love the shirt, the color and softness of it. Thank u.",5
798619,"I like my shorts long.  Like below my knee long.  Its more of a personal preference...im only 6'2"".  Got lucky here with these (unknown) Chickle shorts.  Best part?  They are VERY comfortable.  And i was pleasant surprised when my order came within 2 weeks instead of the 2 months they were forecasting.  I'm going back today to order a different color.",5
36418,This umbrella is very cute but it was covered in some sort of powdery residue when I pulled it out of the box.  I actually had to wash the umbrella to remove the residue and even then it did not come off completely.  My neice ended up loving the umbrella but I felt bad that it was a bit dirty right from the start.,3
394557,"After reading the reviews I ordered a medium. I am 5'4, 38DD and curvy. I got so many compliments, it's a very flattering fit. Paired it with a statement necklace and some wedges for church. But it can be dressed up or down. I will be ordering more in different colors.",5
464296,"This little gem is the perfect size for a long weekend getaway, it carries everything that I need. I have my shampoo, conditioner, body wash, toothpaste, deodorant, and many other essentials 'stuffed' in.  If it' gets too bulky, you can always keep it unzipped and lay it over your clothes in the suitcase.",5
700681,"These pearls are beautiful and well made. I appreciate the suggestions on how to properly care for these simulated pearls.  They are long enough to wear as a double strand.  Very nice, and they can be worn in a casual setting as well as in a dressy setting. I received this product at a discount in exchange for a honest review.",5
767478,"I bought these for my 8 year old and he chose them because of the front wheel.  FYI the front wheel is NOT retractable.  You snap it in then you can use a tool to remove it as you like but there is also a rubber piece that fits back into the sole when the wheel isn't there.  Overall it's a lot to keep up with...tool, two wheels, two rubber pieces...

The shoe is nice, sturdy and very bright but lots of trouble with the second wheel.",4
643030,"So far, I've been happy with this belt. The leather was easy to cut to get the length that I wanted. The ratchet mechanism is of good quality and works well.  I wanted a belt that could be worn several times a week and will hopefully last longer than my traditional belts.",4
528253,LOVE this!!!! It looks exactly like the photo fits amazing even with a 36dd chest and size 8 jeans ( I ordered a large) the suit came ready to wear and in less than two weeks (to New York ) and even got a little gift ! Great all around,5
152233,I'm a 32 D and I ordered a small/medium. Fits great once I carefully pull it over my head. I gave it four stars because I'm a brat and wanted the white color. But it wasn't offered in prime. And It wasn't as fragile as I thought. It lasted great coming off and on again (my bf and I were rolling.) My first buy from this brand and I'm satisfied.,4
623604,"Only thing holding me back from 5 stars is the smell. As other reviews have mentioned, the dress comes smelling like smoke. I always wash new clothes before wearing them and a quick hand wash cycle in my washing machine got rid of the smell. I am just starting to show and I can tell you already that this dress will be one of my office staples throughout my pregnancy. Absolutely love how it fits and how comfortable it is.",4
495292,"Fits perfect. Top is cut perfect as to not allow too much cleavage. Perfect for work, church, or dressed down with a denim jacket and sandals. I bought this in 2 different patterns and love them both. Plan to get a couple more. Great value. Nice fabric and well made. For sizing info I am 5'8"" and 175lbs and the large fit perfect :)",5
420392,"It's great to have Amazon as a resource to purchase items like this which are no longer in production. This is a ""retired"" charm, one that my girlfriend has brought up to me in the past, and I can't find it in the stores. If you have a girlfriend/fiance that loves Disney stuff, this is a great romantic addition to the Chamilia bracelet you have already bought for her.",5
637548,"They must have altered the size of the sleeves since everyone was complaining about big sleeves.  I'm 5'5 and 126lbs. I ordered a large and it just fits, wish it would be a little loser around the body and slightly bigger sleeves. The quality is acceptable and its hand washes well.",3

723405,"I have to 5 star this because it is exactly as described.  However, did think the picture was ''off'' and the tail was proportionate to the adult wearing it.  The tail is about 8'' long and inappropriate to use as part of an adult costume.  I made one instead.  The ears and the bow tie, however was cute and fit.",5
323410,I use this for change in the car.  It's too big for most people to carry around in a pocket -- it would be fine for a purse or briefcase -- but I tend to accumulate a lot of change and this suits my needs just to have to grab when I go into a store.,5
503391,Bra portion is not at all sized right and much to short. Tank long enough to be a dress. The white looks old and gray. Seller does not accept returns so buyer beware. Mine are in the donation pile tags and all. Might be great for a twelve year old!,1

I think silver insanity should inspect the quality of their product before shipping out a defective product.,2
867527,"I love this necklace, it comes with earrings and i didn't know that but was very surprised. It can dress up any outfit and has an artsy boho feel to it. Im also a person for textures and each piece has a unique texture. It feels like a medium weight necklace. Not too heavy but not light or cheap feeling. I am very impressed.",5
550434,"I got these for the shooting range and hunting, but I wear them daily. I have a hard time finding purple hunting/camo stuff so I was thrilled to find these. When I got them, I realized that for the price, they are fairly good quality so I keep them in my car or purse everywhere I go because they REALLY help with the glare and UV protection. I would love another pair. I might just do that.",5
841043,"When I first received the umbrella, I really liked it. When we finally got some significant rain with wind, I was able to use it. I noticed a little later, after the window to return had closed, that the seam along one edge was starting to tear. I'm not sure how much longer the umbrella will be useful. I think the manufacturer should redesign the seams along the edges to be reinforced for long lasting wear.",3

After a year of wear, its kept it's shine and is not scratched at all. It looks like a white gold ring but is very light and strong. The only down side is that this ring will not bend or break, so if you mess up your ring finger then you will have to go to the emergency room to get this ring removed. For the price, this ring is amazing!",5
286445,"It works great! Construction feels a tad bit cheap, and truly hate the idea of having to buy essentially a flashlight to charge my solar watch. but that's just a personal gripe that can be more or less remedied by spending more time out in the sun (something I rarely get to do nowadays). Outside of that, it fully charges my solar watches in less than a day even after they've been in storage for weeks at a time. Would recommend",4

276440,"I purchased these back in March of 2017 and I loved them. I thought they fit well and held together well as long as I took care of them. I am prone to migraines, and when I have one coming on, these help reduce the pain while driving. The UV polarized lenses do their job.

However, the only downside is the fact that I have had both screws fall out that hold the arms to the frame, but that has all happened within the past week.",4

727166,The only thing i dislike about this clutch is that there is not an inner pocket for change. It is large enough though to keep a small coin purse in the clutch.

This particular set has the Frozen characters my grandson loves the most, and he looks adorable wearing them.  Colors are vivid, and the pajamas remain soft and don't fade after repeated washings.

I will be posting a review of the product on my Public Page (Nerdy Mom) as well my instagram so I can let other moms know what an awesome product this is. Thank you!,5
483062,"These have great pockets.  They are quite comfortable.  However, they are a very heavy, polyester feeling fabric, rather like the polyester knit available in the '70s.  The color combination will go with many solid tops and the tight ankle is great for travel.  They run a teeny bit large in the waist.  They are very roomy in the hips and thighs.  I think they will be great in cooler weather!",4
4773,"As the title says, I needed a tuxedo shirt the week before my friend's wedding.  It was a formal wedding and I was unable to go shopping due to time commitments for work and work functions.  I ordered this shirt and accidentally asked for standard shipping.  Well this shirt was shipped same day and it arrived 2 days later.  The shirt was great for the price and the service was even better.",5
469392,"It is so hard for me to find 12 month long sleeved onesies, that when I did find it I just ordered away.  Unfortunately, now I know why they are so cheap-- the arms are way TOO big.  Not long, just fat.  REALLY fat.  They are for layering and always get bunched up.  I would not recommend this product.",2
639331,"5 stars only because I read the other reviews and went with a smaller size (I ordered the size M).  I own another Scala in a size L that fits perfectly and a 7 1/4 in everything else.  Medium is exactly perfect (any bigger and it would be too big).

Great hat, very light, actually showed up and wore exactly like the pic which is rare for me to find on Amazon hats.  Current fave golf type 3"" brim hat I own.",5
253125,"The swimsuit fits great however the bottom doesn't look like the picture, which is why I'm not too satisfied. I do have extra bottoms I can wear instead as you can see in the picture, but I'd rather have new ones that I like since I paid for it. It would also be much better if there were some fringe on the back of the bra top but I think it's not too bad. Besides that the swimsuit is okay.",3
349771,"Was hoping to use this tank as a maternity cami, but it fits great now!  MIGHT stretch some for a pregnant belly, but not for an entire pregnancy for me anyway....Currently I am 5'6"", 143lbs (36C), and I love how it fits me!
Great quality material!
The green is a bright Kelly Green shade...VERY pretty!
Cut is just right on neck, not too high, not too low.
Very well made!
Love it!
I have received this item at a discount for my honest, unbiased review....5 stars!",5
778540,"I bought this dress for a Christmas party to be Morticia Addams. It was okay for a party, but in the photos it looks like a different fabric. Upon arrival it' s a shiny material that looks cheap, and at the knot on the side the seam had come open so you could see my skin. I kept it for the party and will keep it for a future costume but be aware that it looks very cheap and for thirty dollars, you can't use it on a regular occasion.",2
632024,"This is a very cute swimsuit. I'm 5/4, 134 lbs with size D breasts and I ordered an XL. The bottom fits nicely in the butt with decent coverage, and although the top fits there isn't much stretch to the fabric. The mesh part barely misses my nipple so while I can still wear it to lounge in, I probably won't be diving in it any time soon. Also the mesh is white and not tan like the photo, which is disappointing.",3
628363,"I love this watch. I work in an industry in which I constantly check my watch. Everyone compliments me on this watch. Everyone. I've gotten more compliments on this watch than my Movado. It's only ten bucks! I have a black one with blue lights, and a silver with red lights. The reason I didn't give five stars is the cheap metal it's made from. It's that stuff that turns your skin green. Also the clasp is too tight and tough to unhook. They should make a $50 version with better materials.",4
120735,"These are the only swim bottoms I buy, eliminating the expense of disposable swim diapers & pricey bathing suits. They do fit true to size but are especially snug around the leg holes, which effectively prevents leakage. (I've cleaned accidents in public bathrooms & it's simple enough to unsnap, flush & rinse out.) Its easier to get them off, even when wet, using the snap side.  The bright colors can be worn with solid rash guard tops. The only downside is since they're super absorbent, they take a long time to drip-dry if you're not using a dryer.",5
408847,"if i new it was going to look like it came out of a bubble gum machine and paying 4.99 plus 5.99 shipping is a joke I have bought things 100 time this size and paid less shipping junk junk junk,thought this was going to look like a nice piece of jewelery ...not well now it's just broke about 3 days ago 8/9/12 not surprised",1
369643,"Product needs to have separate sizing for top an bottom.  I bought it fo my wife and she loved the top, but the bottoms were way to small.  She is rather buxom and usually has the opposite problem.  They were kind enough to send separate sizing once I contacted them.",3
562632,"Whether it's your bride choosing the colors of fall for the wedding, or that special formal occasion to celebrate your inclusion in the athletic nations of Tennessee, Clemson, Auburn, Syracuse et al, this tuxedo-type bow tie (not a ""tie it yourself,"" but rather a ""wrap the end around your neck and connect it with a hook on the other side"") fills the bill nicely.",5
138499,It was to large and i had to shipped back. You got to put in the right size or you will have to pay to ship it back.  I had to pay for it to be ship out and to pay for it be ship back.  Not worth it. Like the hat but did not like to pay for all the shipping.  I wish there was a better way.,3
269561,I love the size of the wallet. The color was exactly what I expected. It came packaged nicely. I am using it inside a fanny pack so I needed something small but very functional. It fits nicely inside and there's still room for lots of other things. It fits all my cards and cash as well.,5
30475,"I purchased these sweats to be sure they fit and were comfy, and they were perfect. So I reordered...two more... they arrived today...exactly the same only no pockets.  What kind of monster would even make sweatpants without pockets, let alone try to sell them? Who prefers no pockets? Real people? Pffft. Realy people like pockets, for phones, keys, wallets, bits of garbage to be thrown, kids stuff, you get the idea. No one wears sweat pants for fashion. Its all about comfort and utility. I am annoyed.",2

I am a licensed armed Security Officer and my employer demands, correctly in my opinion, that their uniform appearance be flawless. There is personal choice in outfitting the cover and boots/shoes.

Armed or not, the company feels that a confident and flawlessly dressed officer often deters bad behavior.",5
335172,"This bathing suit is absolutely perfect!  It fits better than any other suit I've been able to find in my (plus) size.  Perfect support ""up top"", And super cute on! I would definitely recommend this bathing suit to anyone who has had a hard time finding a cute plus size suit.",5
490319,"I'm about a size 8, so I must say I wasn't sure if a ""S/M"" would fit right, especially with a stretchy dress.  It was even tighter than I imagined though.  Would be OK on a size 4 with no hips, but otherwise don't bother.  I had to return it even though the color was lovely.",3
99592,"This arrived today, and its a beautiful bag for the price - the color is the dark blue as pictured, and it seems to be very well made. All of the stitching is good, and the zippers are good and are not sticky(hate sticky zippers!). The bag has lots of room with inside pockets and zip as well as the zip compartment on the outside. It also comes with a detachable shoulder strap. If you want a stylish bag that looks a lot more expensive than it is, then I recommend this one. Will definitely order again!",5
848286,"I wore it once, and less than an hour into my event the zipper broke. When i tried to get a replacement, i was simply refunded my money even though I requested a replacement. I was really disappointed because the dress fit great and looked amazing. Plus the price was unbeatable. So disappointed in the quality :(",1
351895,"I did not get the colors shown in the picture (I got 2x red, 2x white, 2x yellow, 2x black, 2x light pink, 2x royal blue) but they will suffice (will be used as party favors) - although I was hoping for the grey and darker pink to be in the mix (the yellow is really bright!).  There are some small threads coming off most, but nothing too bad.  Overall they are fine for the price.",3
281904,I purchased the yellow jeggings and was so excited when they came I had to try them on... I was very disappointed to find out they are completely see through no matter what I do. Unfortunately I won't be wearing these because there's really no way to fix the issue.,1
861355,"Very disappointed in sizing. Even though I normally wear a medium to large the reviews said they ran small so I bought the XL. This garment was so small my mother, who wears a small, counldnt get her arms in it. It looked like it was sized for a child instead of an adult. Returning item and won't be buying from this seller again.",1
215001,"Fit well and quite sturdy. Palms are a strong material. Rest of material could be tougher, but should stand up well for a young girl. They are reasonably warm and my daughter can easily get these on and off with no problem of collapsing finger holes inside the glove. Haven't tested them in snow yet, just cool mid 30's weather but worked well for that.",4
284469,Well I got pretty much what I expected for $2. It fell apart coming out of the bag. I cut some links off since it was broken. Its very long but we put it back together and it hasn't fallen apart since. I barely wear it for fear I will turn green but you get exactly what you pay for.,3
223510,"This top is nice and shipping is quick.  It is partially lined front and back ; from top to almost top of belly button (I'm 5.5 so you judge for your self).  Should it have been fully lined 5 stars because it is super sheer fabric. I also had to clip the strings but for the price I can live with that. I am size 4 dress and ordered XL thinking it would run small, however Large would have worked for loose Boho look.",3
424820,The earring came promptly and I was surprised by the nice touch that they sent me a free gift keychain. Obviously all ears are different so making such an ear cuff that will fit all ears is impossible but you somehow manage to put it on even though it doesnt fit as nicely as it does on the picture. enjoying it anyways,4
64732,"My son will be 3 soon and he currently wears a 2t. I ordered the Mickey Mouse pack in a 4t because I read on other reviews that they run small. The 4t fit him just right. But although I ordered Mickey Mouse 7pk , I got Jake and the Neverland Pirates 6pk",2
725904,"i bought this thinking it would make a cute oversized shirt, but it actually was too small. i guess i would say order it a size or two bigger if you want it oversized. i usually wear a medium to large but the large was kind of tight (not like skin tight, but not very loose.) soo, if you like looser shirts order a size bigger. still a cute shirt though.",3
863275,"Just as a warning, this bathing suit is a LOT more open on the sides than what it looks like in the pictures. It is not just a small cutout on the side. So if you are thinking this would be a good bathing suit to camoflauge your midsection, it is not, because you can see most of your midsection from the side cutout panels. I really wanted to love this bathing suit, and it would be great for someone who is ok showing off their midsection, but it is not for someone who is self-conscious about that area.",2
402896,"I am normally a 34DD, but I buy 36D in this sports bra.  It is the only bra I have ever owned that I can comfortably run in.  I have tried soo many sports bras and was always uncomfortable running because nothing was supportive enough.  This one is it for me.",5
406582,"Could not wait to receive this watch, after seeing it on Amazon.  Did not disappoint looks fantastic on. It's finally a watch that's not too big not to small perfect size. The watch feels great on wrist not to heavy but still very masculine. Great buy and value for automatic. Very happy with this purchase.",5
288268,"I love this maternity dress! I feel like the material is very soft. The colors are bright. The material seems a little thin, but the top is reinforced. The top is fairly low cut. I have to wear a tank under the dress when I wear it to work, because my cleavage would be out if not. Otherwise, I absolutely love these and will buy them in other patterns!",5
315737,"I just receive this bag and love it !!! I travel a lot and I am always searching for the perfect bag. While it is a little on the big side, it is flat and I should have no problem fitting it into my suitcase. I love all the pockets and zipper products. Inside the pockets they include nice compartments and secure nylon holders. I think my search is finally over for the perfect toiletry bag!",5
853085,The earrings looked so pretty on the product description page and I ordered them to go with a pink dress I own. It was a real shock when they arrived with a couple of beads from one of them already loose in the box. The rest fell apart pretty soon! Also the beads have a plasticky appearance. I know it's just $10- but it isn't a tall order to get at least 1 wear out of it :( I got 0- so 1 star.,1
495191,"Super cheap and poorly cut. It was baggy in the belly area and so tight around the neck it made my wife feel like she was being choked all at the same time. Material was super cheep and crappy. Glad some people are happy with this product, cause I was not at all.",1
786866,"This does fit snugly, so if you're worried about sizing perhaps it's best to order a size up. The shirt itself is slightly more sheer than I expected. I expected a standard tee shirt type material, but this is more shiny and slippery of a fabric. I do love it though.",4
526826,I love the dress i buy 5 a year from them .Different Styles but have never Been Disappointed.  But these are so 50s i love them so much wash like new not see thru at all.talk to your neighbors water your flowers and talk to the ups driver when he brings your next order. For me i don't have throw away money . I'm telling you out west i sent my sister these she can wear them all day everyday so quality means something. they have it.,5
575873,"For the price it's a very good scarf. The colors aren't as dark as on the picture but it's still very cute and soft. In the first few days I've had it I've had a few threads come out, but the scarf is so big it doesn't make a difference. I really love it and I get lots of compliments on it",4
805623,I received this purse for my Birthday and I'm very pleased with it!  I love the Flag d&eacute;cor. It's a  very Patriot Purse.  It is larger than my other Montana West  Concealed Carry Handbags.  I like this because plenty of room and makes it easier getting into the gun area.  I would certainly recommend this handbag.,5

I am a curvy girl and I wear these up on the waist and they look flattering on me. Living in southern Florida, I'm not a shorts girl, so these are perfect! They look best with a plain ribbed cotton tank, imo. :0)",5

And found them. Got my pair before the delivery date. I was surprised as to how quickly they arrived. The size is perfect.
Anyway, get  a pair  in every color and be cool this summer and a  white pair to go with everything. I wear mine all year because I live in California.
This seller is fantastic.",5

73046,"A tad large, but it's the first non-custom hat I've ever had that wasn't too small.  It's the largest in the line (up to size 8) and the next down is absolutely too small.  I know how to pad a sweatband.
Otherwise?  Stays on in moderate wind, shades me (an absolute requirement), is warm when it's cold and dry when it rains.  Plus it really does stand a huge degree of abuse (I'm taking college classes so it gets a lot!)
I've even gotten some compliments on appearance.  Who knew?",5
121602,"First, this product is way too small, about two sizes.  If you have a butt, forget it!  What you will get is the appearance these you have a shaper on with two cut outs in the back.  This might work well for thinner women trying to get a full appearance, but not for anyone who has a butt and trying to get a little lift to it.",1

This is perfect for that in-between phase! I was skeptical about it keeping my pants up, but it definitely works and is comfortable. I followed the sizing chart and ordered a small which fits well.",5
798790,"It is beautiful. I was pleasantly surprised to see it come in its own zip up suit bag, that was a nice touch that told me that the seller took it seriously. Though I don't like the mask, (which is fine because that is an easy enough fix), the rest of the costume is awesome. Being 5' 8"" and around 140 pounds I ordered a medium and I was afraid it might be too small, but if fits great.",5
81078,"The pictures does not describe accurately that this is a Hi-Low fit on the skirt. The front of the skirt is just above the knee and the back of the skirt is on the floor. The quality of the dress is very nice, although you might need to tack down some of the appliques in spots.",4

It is looser than I thought around the bottom around my ribs, and the sleeves don't come down quite as far as in the photo (I don't think they are as long as in the photo), but still very cute! Also, while it is white, it isn't a bright white. But I love it and can't wait to wear it for my husband!",4

This is one long strand of a bracelet that wraps around your wrist three times, with varying clasp holes for three different sizes. Its lovely. Fresh out of the box you can really smell the leather of the bands, and the stones catch the light in a subtle and fun kind of way. Shipped fast, if that matters for you. Ill likely cut away the final knot to reduce overhang.",5
615918,"This item is not for me personally, I got it for one of my good friends for an Christmas present. It is a little smaller then what I thought, but it is very pretty and can probably fit some smaller jewelry. I would recommend this product, especially if you like bows. Overall very cute item!",5

But it looked perfect for the occasion. the fitting was nice . A little lose from the underarms . The strap quality is not the best.",4
263026,"I am a size 14/16 and I love this top. It has a little bit of stretch and falls nicely over my curves. I wore it poolside over a bathing suit, but I think I prefer it with a cami underneath and shorts or leggings. I haven't tried to wash it yet but I will do it by itself on the gentle cycle and air dry.",5

The shoes have a great fit with enough space for movement of the toes. The price is also and added plus since many shoes for bikes can be expensive and I do not have much choice due to size.",5
51215,I borrowed my sister in laws Belly Band after I had my daughter. I am about to deliver my second now. I would recommend it to moms. It is a bit rigid and stiff. It is recommended to wear it for 6 weeks- everyday. I can't wear it that long. I do have to take breaks. I find it hard to nurse and wear it. It is basically a corset.,5

193229,These shoes are amazing! So light and so comfortable! I love that you can take the lining out and put in your own arch supports (I use SmartFeet). I also have narrower feet and these are perfect. They're great for runs under like three or four miles and for weight lifting. True cross trainers! I'm super excited to wear these out just so I can buy another pair. The price here is unbeatable.,5
637797,"This was a well constructed bag that is much larger than I first thought. My wife was able to easily move items from her other purse into this bag and she loved the different sections within the bag itself. The strap was strong and held the bag well.

I'm a smidge over 5', 135lbs and ordered a medium because I thought a small would by too tight. I was wrong. The medium is actually looser than I would like. A small would have hugged my curves a bit better. Can't knock off stars for that. I overestimated.",5
438476,"A few things:
It was a little long, I am 5'3"". so I had a girlfriend take off 8 inches of hem so that I didn't look like I was wearing a ballgown.
It was stretchy, and built for someone with MUCH larger breasts than I have, so I have to do some adjusting there.

But all in all, for a non custom made pin-up dress?! Fabulous!",5

227289,"I love this hood!! Its so cute and the fabric is much softer then I thought it would be. The fur is nice and fluffy but it sheds and it smells like plastic. Over time it should go away tho. The shipping was fast but it was a day late which isn't that big of a problem. Im really happy with the ears, as they don't fall down. Im about 5'4 and the length is perfect ",4
307439,The top part was so small I wear a medium and that is what I bought however it only came halfway down my boobs...cutting them in half. Customer service did get back to me right away and gave me a refund..but the dress still doesn't fit. The 3 stars are for the comfy material and the customer service and if you have very small boobs it will be perfect for you,3
813044,Not the best self adhesive bra for breasts of size 32 C cup. The cup C for this bra turned out to be larger  than expected. May be B cup would have been a better choice. I also didn't like the shape of this bra because it seems to have been made for 34 or 36 size breasts rather than 32 size breasts. There was considerable amount of space between the nipps and the bra.,2

538429,Delivered on time. Shoes look great I really love them. No problems with the product but the box was pretty much destroyed when I opened it and the original tag was torn off the shoe which was a little dissappointing because I always keep them when I buy new pairs of vans. But other than that everything is perfect.,4
59409,Good quality hat and it got here quick. The price was great and I had given up on finding something local that was worth what the retailer wanted. Most local hats were of cheap quality and way over priced. Once again it was time to go to Amazon and get what I wanted not what a retailer wanted to push on me. Amazon is far better than dealing with e-bay which to me has become over priced.,5

The first rip started around the zipper, then as I used it more it started making its way around. Then the sides even started ripping! I only carry shoes and clothes in the thing, so i'm not sure why it started unraveling on me. The fabric used seems to pull from the threads.",1
395937,Super silky soft material and so very comfortable. Make sure you order a size or two up depending on how you like it to fit. It does look great with shorts or jeans and I also use it under other shirts that are loose or low cut. It is very comfortable. Washes up really well and does not fade or shrink. Really cool and comfortable on those hot summer days. Nice bathing suit coverup also. The material is stretchy but doesn't stretch out of shape. I received this for a discount in exchange for an honest review,5
357515,"I did not like these at all. They kept coming off my child's hand. The little bows came off after washing them.

I put one pic of the stitching but it's all over the dress. DO NOT BUY. One or two ppl may have gotten lucky but it's not what u think. The material is like table cloth except super thin. Bad bad bad.,1

335926,"We ordered this blazer for my daughter who is going to Germany on a Rotary Youth Exchange.  It fit her great, enough room for her to wear light sweaters but she's not swimming in it.  It's not too heavy and it looks very professional.  Very pleased with the blazer,",5
173889,"To get a 20 in. neck I end up with a little more shirt than I need, but at least I can button the collar. Every one was impressed with the
combination of the shirt  and tie, especially my wife. Real happy with both and give it 5 stars.  G @ Whitehorse.",5
137480,"For the price, these are the best gloves I've ever owned. They don't cost much at all, so they aren't finely finished or fancy, and some threads are loose, but they do the job.

I worked in a cold climate where my hands would get cold and messy, so I wanted some gloves that would keep my hands warm, allow me to grip with my finger tips, and that I would not regret getting dirty. These fit the bill perfectly.

Love them!",4
166056,"Amazing!!!!!!!!!!! I have over 20 different pairs and brands of workout pants; Danskin, Adidas, Nike, Express, Limited, some random off-brands... These pants outdo all the rest in so many ways. The material is not super thick, so they're not hot. The length is just right, above the ankle and below the calf-very flattering. They have a thick and wide waistband that STAYS PUT!!!!! I do Tabata, so lots of mountain climbers, jumping, etc. and these pants didn't slide down at all. Sooooooo happy with this purchase.  After falling in love with the black, I just ordered several other colors.",5
334930,"This bootie is exactly as described.  I wear size 6 and it fits perfect. I haven't worn them around yet, but
around the house they felt comfortable. The color is a distressed brown, the picture does not do it justice.
They look better in person. I have skinny ankles and the height and circumference around the ankle is
just right. I highly suggest. ENJOY",5

I was noticing today that they are still holding up very well.

The slippers have great stitching, they are very well made and have lasted for a long time. I've worn them myself on many occasions and they are plush and comfortable. The colors are bright and engaging and overall I give these a 5 star because they were worth every penny that I paid.",5
396246,"These are really nice water shoes.  I got them for my husband so when we go to Lava Hot Springs, ID he can wear these from pool to pool whether it is cold or the ground is hot and protect his feet.  They fit him very nicely and the little extra sole on the bottom should keep them from wearing out for a good long time.  He could also wear these around the house and while bringing stuff out to the car or garbage.
I received these at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",5
137159,"These look really stylish and simple. The frame felt a little tight, but after a few minutes of wear, I didn't really notice anymore. I like that it's snug and doesn't slide around. I also like the polarized lens. Everything is crisp and clear, no glare. One downside to the lenses is that they aren't very well tinted, so sunlight is still a bit bright. Completely worth the cheap price, in my opinion.",4
644150,"I have had this bag for a year. It's the BEST. Cleans easily, doesn't stain or mildew as other material bags so often do. The only issue was the pull tab on the zipper broke very quickly. I came up with my own solution, and it works even better than the small pull tab anyway.",5
746918,"I bought this for my teenage son for Christmas as he showed me it and really wanted it!! It Shipped quickly and was packaged securely. And thankfully he absolutely loves it!! He is 5 foot 10 and slender build. The mens small fits him well. Only wish the arms were a smidge longer, so we will not put it in the dryer, rather well hang dry it.  The quality is great and the colors are nice and vibrant!!  He has not wanted to take it off since:) Totally recommend",4
842070,my daughter absolutely loves these pajamas! they are super soft and fit extremely true to size. there aren't any rough edges or annoyances. The design seems to be of great quality but I do plan to wash inside out as you should with any clothing with printed design. I will note that I was fortunate enough to receive this at a reduced price for my honest opinion.,5
721467,"Very cute, a lot of pockets and zippers , fit great my 11 inches tablet , and a lot of stuff , the green is slightly lighter than in the picture in the military green tone matching my winter jacket , the fabric is polyester with slightly silky shine and matte long adjustable strap , looking better in person than on the picture , medium size not too baggy but trust me a lot of space for everything inside and out .",5
371651,"This Ring is so pretty! It's definitely bigger than my wedding ring, so I was a little self-conscious at first, but by the end of the day I was feeling like celebrity status. Great product at a great price! Perfect for travel or to wear as an accessory to a more formal event. I took pictures of it paired with my wedding band ( without flash, just natural lighting.)",5
380738,"Best covers on the market that I've found so far! Mine have held up great over the last 4 months and I wear them all. the. time! I can wear tight fitting white tops with no problem. From the edge of the cover to my skin is almost seamless and doesn't have that unwanted noticeable ridge. Also, these keep my sensitive skin happy, who else has had bright red skin in the shape of a flower petal for two whole days after irritating adhesives?!",5
548836,"Too tight in the wasitband and because they are soooo highwaisted (almost to my ribs), they put pressure on my stomach - which actually makes me ill. The fit theough the leg is very stretchy and nice but the top is much more rigid. I'm definitely not keeping them. I'm an athletic build 5'3"" and 125lbs for reference and I got a small.",2
62031,"It wasn't secure enough for the first weeks post TAH (I continued using the abdominal binder) but now in my 4th week, it feels like just the right support. I purchased the beige one and will be also ordering one in black. Fits true to size, creates a smoother flatter shape.",5
766514,"Item is not necessarily as shown, but close. The ducks are smaller. This is not what I would wear with formal attire, but more for a costume. If you want a good ducky tie, get the Pop Tease version that is about $10 more. You will be happy with that one.",3
13808,These were recommended by my podiatrist for my flat feet. It took a couple of days to get used to. I have been wearing a pair every weekend while working in the yard and they have helped relieve my pain in the left ankle where I have bone spurs and osteoarthritis. They have been a tremendous help. I just bought a second pair for my dress shoes that I will use when I am standing for long periods.,5
667894,"I love this so much. I wore it in a photoshoot and other than a slight wardrobe malfunction (because I was wearing a bra) it looked amazing!

I did end up sewing the sleeves tighter, they were very baggy around my wrist and looked a bit homely. Other than that this is awesome.",4
668888,"I normally wear a 10/12 however ordered up (16) based on the reviews. I think a 14 would have been better, as there is an easy two inches of extra fabric in the ribs. It doesn't look bad, so I won't be exchanging for the smaller size. I plan on wearing this as a bridesmaids dress for a summer wedding.",5
370332,"If it wasn't for the price, I'd give them one star. I'm petite, but I have a bit of a bum and muscular legs.  I bought the pack of three in a small/medium. These leggings constantly ride down on me because the waist is loose, but they're too tight in the butt and thighs. They also pill very easily. I've decided I'd only wear these at home or under snow/ski pants. They're warm and comfortable, but they don't stay in place at all.",3
850399,"Nice logo but this shirt was way too small. When I asked for a exchange I was asked to try the shirt on, take a picture and send it to them.  I work out and have been wearing a 2xl shirt for at least 30 yrs.  Very disappointed with this company.",1
156753,"Very classy in appearance, well packaged ( would make a great impression as a gift because it is in a beautiful box! ) fits easily in my pocket or small purse, credit cards and drivers license fit perfectly inside.  I can't find anything negative to say about this protective case.  Worth the reasonable price.  Say goodbye to plastic and treat yourself or someone else to a quality case!  Glad I did!",5
159137,this is pretty cool if you wanna get one and ware it get this one its in great shape and doesn't scratch has good weight to it and its pretty cool to show to people this way if you own the expensive one you can use this one without ever touching your good one,5
11017,"I just bought the size 6/7 for my slender (about 46 pounds) 6 1/2  year old and they are a perfect on him now. I don't see them fitting him in 13 more months. He told me they were softer than another brand we just bought, so I'm picking up another package of the Calvin Klein boxer briefs today.",5
29439,"Costume is pretty good.  Make sure you get right size  I ordered an XL.  I am about 6ft, 36 waist.  Its a little big.  Helmet is a little warped from packaging.  Nothing you can't re-shape to fit better.  I am a Fan of the movies and it look cool in the pic.",4
115389,"Despite the specifications clearly stating that these are polarized lenses, they are not. The packaging they came in was labeled with the correct item number (WF01PZ) and has the word polarized on it, but these sunglasses themselves don't have any indicator on them that they are polarized, and in fact they are not. They are ok other than that, but they are incorrectly marked, and I'm not going to spend all of the time to return them for $5.",2
476783,I was able to purchase them for around $4- definitely worth the price! I like the colors and my daughter has outfits to match each one.  She can be picky about headbands (she's two and half) but these seem comfy and she leaves them on for long periods. I also like the size of the flowers- not too big like a lot of headbands I've seen. They also haven't been damaged even after being shoved into book bag or her hair accessory box.,5
470210,"For the money, this is an excellent buy. I wish it went up to XL, but I lost 10 lb. and now it fits much better. It does stretch though and is very soft. It is probably true that this wouldn't work well for larger cup sizes. Makes an excellent corset liner if the fit works.",4
345244,Love it! I use mine for a purse/ diaper bag  it's perfect I can fit all my Lil man's needs and my normal Items for me. It's cute and I haven't l had any zipper problems with it like I have read on some other reviews for this item. My kids drag it around on the floor when I ask them to bring it to me and I toss it in the car when I'm putting the baby in so I believe it is a pretty durable bag plus you can't beat the price!,4
426497,"My son wanted a pair of vans much like the ones I had.  We went to numerous stores around my area but could not find any in his size.  We found these in his size and they were the same style he was looking for.  They came to us quickly and were exactly as described.  I do reccomend getting a half size larger, which we did, as they seem to run a tad smaller than their published size.",5
256767,"I love this swimsuit, however, it could be a bit wider all the way around so that it covers your breasts properly. When you first look at it you'll think, "" how the heck do I put this on?"" but you will figure it out. Once on, it does look nice.",4
212579,"4 stars because my daughter loves it.  I couldn't quite give it 5 because it's not nearly as soft as the fox hoodie we purchased for the same amount.  The wolf hoodie we received has coarse fur and wonky ears.  Like I said, she loves it though!",4
851430,"This tunic top fits me exactly as pictured on the model...except it comes to about an inch above my knees, because I am 5'4"".  I am 125 lbs and have a 34"" bust and and got a medium. I bought this to take to Haiti on a missions trip to wear with yoga pants while I teach liturgical dance.  I needed something comfortable and modest.  The fabric is soft, not too thin. Very happy with this!!",5
250843,"Before thinking that it doesn't fit, you have to learn how to put it on. The hooks go on the right side. You start by buttoning the bottom but starting it at the middle of your stomach. After clipping 5 or so you pull it all the way down and button the rest. It is supposed to fit tight. Enjoy!",5
522080,"This is a pretty cool earring! It's okay quality but great for the price you get it for. Although, my ears are sensitive to fake metals, so I have to clean my ear piercing and earring with alcohol before and after I wear it to avoid getting an infection. Other than that, love it! :)",5
46594,"Order arrived in record time.  I really like these ear muffs a lot.  I do, however, put them on different from the instructions that came with them.  I pop them open and then insert my ear into it and then flatten it out.  Could not get them on at all with instructions given.  They are so comfortable and stay on while I do my walking.  Well worth the price.",5
680618,"Simple yet genius idea.  Those buttons are always tough to get and these collar stays help with those stubborn buttons.  The dual purpose and low cost of these are what makes them stand out from a normal collar stay.  I would recommend these to all my family and friends.  The Quality and instructions provided are awesome.  Can't get a better quality collar stay at this price, take advantage of it!!",5
30270,"I'm a size 16-18 and these fit me okay. They seem stretchy enough when I put them on and they look good. The first 4 hours I wore them I was mostly standing with little walking. Once I got out and started walking around, the crotch kept sliding down to just above my knees and the fabric started bunching under my feet. I'll probably wear them again if I have another costume that requires them, but I doubt I'll wear them for day to day.",3
138830,"These are a really nice color of green! They fit pretty nicely (i'm a size 5-6 in jeans), and aren't really too snug or too big. I was worried that the top seam would be a darker color than the rest of the tights, but it seems fine. Would definitely buy this brand for another cosplay.",5
526386,"I love this. I wear a 2x, and purchased the regular 2x, and it fits perfectly with room to spare. Not too big nor too small. The cotton is a bit rough, but not terribly so....it doesn't irritate my skin at all. Seems to be well made. I bought one for my mother - she loves hers, too.",5
450510,"These shorts are NOT true to size. I ordered a size 13 and felt like they could fit a size 3. They were marked size 13, but definitely ran WAY TOO SMALL. I hated these shorts and ended up giving them to good will instead of returning them so someone else can get use out of them. I was extremely bummed out because I loved these shorts online and was so excited to receive them, but no thanks. I will stay away from these.",1
741038,"These are the cutest winter hatsfor babies! I bought 2. My baby is 4 months old in the picture and 16 lbs (wearing 9 month size clothes). Both fit her with room to grow. Both thick as well with fleece lining inside. One has plastic snap buttons for the strap, which I like, and won't scratch baby like velcro and snap buttons are more secure. The other one has no chin strap but hugs the head nicely and won't fall off easily. Very happy with these hats.",5
100247,"The leather looks great and appears/feels to be good quality. Holds passport and 4 cards. Has two other pockets that are good for holding cash, receipts, etc. I really like that it keeps passport and everything else in one place. There is some ""foam"" padding of sorts sewn into the leather, but that will compact as you use it. It could more fairly comfortably in my front pockets, but more-or-less fit in my back pocket as well.",5
673920,Earrings were very pretty but they arrived broken. I don't know if it was from shipping or how they are made but one of the earrings arrived in two pieces. I was going to just fix it but there wasn't a clear way to do that so I just returned it.,1
766374,We bought 2 of the dragon urn necklace and can't get either one to open so that we can use them. We will mail them back for a full refund unless someone can contact us and help us to solve this problem. The other urns that we purched we are happy with. Thank You,3

I'm still wearing these swim shorts every week.  They are fabulous and last forever!",5
105227,Love this blouse! Not something you see everyday. It fits like a juniors medium. If you normally wear a misses medium I would probably get a large. I'm in between small and medium in misses and the medium fit as shown in the picture. Sleeves are a great length for me. I'm 5 ft and around 125lbs. Snug fit but a large would have been to big.,5
147442,"Nice and light, its great for the summer months and hot climates. looks classy over a pair of jeans or leggings!!
It is extremely loose, which I like, and as its one size, if you are a size small or medium, it may appear quite large on you,
but that is the general look. i love it.",5
33395,"These fit me perfectly as I'm 5'11 130 pounds. I feel I have smaller thighs but these socks are still very tight at the top. I don't mind because I got these socks for the length. If your looking for ultimate comfort, these might not ur best option. For me I love them.. thin, super high and cute. I just ordered another color now that I know how they fit",4
690426,"I'm 5""9, 210 pounds of dic, that being said I ordered an xl and it fits perfectly. Not too tight around my arms and when I throw my hands up on my ape bars my butt crack doesn't show.((  love the print, I haven't washed it yet. Will update after I wash n air dry down the highway.",5
147926,We ordered this same ring about 2 years ago and my husband never had any irritation or break outs on his finger. He is allergic to metal so its alwasy hit or miss. Our previous ring cracked so we decided to order again. Only this time a terrible rash started. Im it sure what is different between the two but we are sadly disappointed.,1
203748,the product is fine I just have a very chunky 4 month old grandson.  He is off the charts in height and 98% weight.  The length of these Leveret footed pajamas was fine but we could not zip them on him.  The material is good quality - very soft.,3
72268,"Good quality, good price.  excellent product, Ibought for my son a king of large, but was my mistake, so I have to save it for the next year that my boy can use, I love crocs, the color is like the photo no surprise.  The size is equal that they show.",4
436088,"Sometimes 5 stars is just not enough,,,,I give them 7 stars.
Because in design and quality this is perferct....excellent.
I am amazed by the super low price...normally I would
expect to pay around $50.00 for this and by the way its
not just about dollars it is abut the design and the polish.
It sparkles like it was made for wonder woman.
Great product and it expands in all its length as a sort
of spring twirled metal....very sexy as well....perfect gift.
You will need a box since it comes in a plastic bag.",5
616068,"I did not care for this shirt. I am normally a size extra large in other nursing tank tops. The shirt was extremely tight and uncomfortable. In the picture, the shirt looked like a very long top. When I tried on the shirt it barely covered my mid drift. I know that sometimes clothes can run small but this was excessively small. This shirt seemed to be of very poor quality and I would not recommend it to others who are above a size small. I will most likely not order from this seller again.",2
319746,"I bought this for my cousin along with another cat ring and its really cute. The quality is nice but I would suggest keeping it away from water only because I'm sure it will tarnish faster. But as a fashion piece for cat lovers like my cousin and I, we really liked it.",5
122949,"Yikes! Oversized is an understatement, I'm 5'6 150 . ordered a large and its giant. The color is... Blah. I thought it would be super cute with some leggings. Its probably going to sit in the back of my closet. Very thin material, and it doesn't go over the shoulder unless you weigh 50 lbs. Awkward turtle neck.",1
769232,I bought this shirt for a star wars light side 10k run. For the quality of the shirt is decent. I bought a large because i was worried it would be too tight and i like my tees a little loose and it fits great. Im a 5'2 adult female and i usisally buy small to medium tees. You can always go a liitle bigger and put it in the dryer after the wash and it will probably shrink a liitle since its 100% cotten.,4
568508,"love this dress! get compliments every time i wear it. would give it 5 stars except that the bottom hem rides up my legs. it will not stay at my calves, which is where it is most flattering.  but, still love this dress, even if i have to tug at the bottom some.",4
653007,It came quickly and in good condition. I really like this shirt. It is just like the picture including the length. It is long in both the front and back. The back is mesh and see though but tastefully. Light weight. However I would say that the red is not bright red but more like a brick/rust red. Would purchase more items from this seller.,4
831404,"It's super cute but it was somewhat too large for me. I ordered the smallest size and it did not fit as snug as what it looks like in the pictures. I'm 5'2 at 120lbs so if you have a small frame, I don't recommend this for you as it will sag a bit.",3

I lost 131 dollars, but they will lose more, because neither I nor my people will buy you anything... I HATE IT THIS HANDBAG",1
647727,"Quality was fine. I ordered two sizes because my top and bottom are different sizes, and I heard the bottoms were very small. To say these run small is an understatement. The large bottom might fit a tween, but probably would still expose a portion of buttock. I had read the reviews, and I went for it anyway. Let me reiterate what people have said before: unless you wear a double zero and don't mind posterior flesh exposure, do not buy this bikini no matter how cheap it is.",1
764271,"This is a well made, high quality pant in many aspects.  Unfortunately, as with many products now days, no one seems to pay attention
to the total product, and specifications are not given on the rise.  The rear rise is quite skimpy, very short.  With every step the legs pulls in an uncomfortable way.",2
588474,"For the price, the bathing suit is great! However, I'm only 5'1 and the length is off. The part that is supposed to be under my chest is several inches lower and I can't pull it up or stretch it high enough. I can pull the halter strings really tight so my chest is covered but it's uncomfortable. Very cute, though and feels like good quality.",4
712725,Love this little dino hoody! I did size up for my 2.5 year old. He is in the middle of 2ts and 3ts and this fits with room to grow! Its so cute! Can't wait for the weather to change so little man can rock this! It is not very thick so will be perfect for transition weather and to wear indoors during the winter.,4
845278,"I have spent close to $200 buying different pairs of no show socks that would slip off my heel within my first 10 steps.  No more, I will only be spending my money on these socks....they are pretty, feel good and, best of all, they do not slip off my heel!",5
405500,"I bought a small, which according to the sizing guide I was supposed to do. Not only was this dress SKIN TIGHT, it was also obscenely short (when I lifted up my arms, it went halfway up my butt). I ended up wearing it as a long tank top over pleather leggings, which worked perfectly, but this was definitely WAY smaller than advertised.",3
24961,"I've been using these for about four years, after my podiatrist diagnosed me with plantar fasciitis. After some judicious stretching and icing, along with the power step inserts, I was able to avoid cortisone therapy or surgery. Everything is back to normal. I am on my feet for the job, 8-12 hours a day and am an avid hiker. Power Step inserts are life savers!",5

The bottoms would fit someone with 36"" hips more comfortably. The top was almost impossible to get on so maybe if your bra band is 32"" or 34"" and your cup is no larger than a B. This couldn't hold my boobs at all.",1
434237,"Loved the feel and look of the shorts. Unfortunately they were to large and I didn't want to exchange them not knowing if a size down would fit or be too small. The chamois looked great, the material of the shorts comfortable. I'm sure they would stand up to many long rides on the bike as long as you got the right fit.",3
545595,"OMG. Went to get dressed, got my sandals ready to put on and to my horror they sent me regular pantyhose..I can't believe it! If I wanted regular pantyhose I would have ordered regular pantyhose especially in the summer where no one wears pantyhose. I was going to a wedding and hate the veins in my legs that's why I ordered these in the first place. I hope this company rectifies their mistake.",1
715702,I bought the coat for my teen daughter who usually wears a girls size 14-16.  She is 5ft 1/2inch and 90 lbs.  I selected the Asian size Medium and it is the perfect length and fit.  She loves it.  I decided on this coat because it said it was sized small.  Very happy with our purchase.,5
343307,I normally wear a size 20G nose ring and when I got my job they told me I would have to wear a clear stud so I bought these. Sadly these are slightly too small and my nose ended up closing to the size of the stud and i had to force my original stud back in.,3

After I already submitted the order I then noticed the shipping date was going to be a month away, which is after my birthday so I freaked out and then sent whoinshop an email. The dress got here a week later and everything about the dress was perfect! Fits just right and is exactly how its pictured! Great quality!",5
408098,The leather on this belt cracked on my first wear while tightening it.  I would not purchase the belt again.  After a few wears the belt is practically unwearable due to the tears and cracks in the leather.  It is pretty obvious they used cheap leather in creating this product.,2

I can say that it fits her perfectly and the material and stitching seem to be of high quality. I was also pleasantly surprised by how soft the diaper feels. I had expected the materials to be somewhat stiff and/or a bit scratchy. It is quite soft and pliable -inside and out. Can't wait to have her wear it in the water",4

80261,"this was okay. they do include the glasses, nice touch, the material for the top piece  is well, inexpensive, as the price is. I do think with maybe a strapless bra underneath I can give this some umph...but it's not quite what I was hoping for, suffice it to say it looks better on the model than me. if you're a bit shorter and bustier, but also thin. this might be perfect. I'm 5'7"" and it just seems like my torso is too long and this sort of stretches flat over me.",3

41906,"I expected a much smaller purse for the price, but it is VERY nice and roomy; I still haven't filled it up, which was a surprise to me.  There are plenty of separate storage areas, more than I've had before, and it is probably the handiest and most convenient purse I've ever had.",5
75930,"This changed my pregnancy. In first 5 weeks of being pregnant, I was bloated, pants didn't fit, stomach achy and crampy. These were perfect.
My thighs etc didn't grow, just my belly and love handles :)

This was perfect so that I didn't show at all and could wear to work and be extremely comfortable. Love how you can wear it different ways for how your belly grows during pregnancy.",5
662474,Barbell is very cute however it does not come apart at the anchor which makes it very difficult to both get in or out of the ear piercing. The anchor is also kinda big and catches on everything  especially while sleeping. The material its made of also irritates my piercing which is why ive been trying to remove it for two days now with no luck.,2
169275,Let me start by saying I have a severe problem with chafing when I run further than 5 miles. These briefs not only prevented that but felt absolutely amazing. I have zero problems with the price at all.  These things just seem to hug in all the right places and I look forward to running a marathon soon and see how they hold up.,5
775156,"I've been looking for an angelic necklace that is delicate and well made. I saw this at 100% silver and very reasonably priced. I am extremely impressed! The necklace is a nice weight, the silver is high quality, and the setting is beautiful. Seriously considering ordering another for my daughter! Can't wait to show this off!! Great buy!!",5
364394,"I bought the palm tree bathing suit and I am in love with it! I was concerned about the size from the comments so I went with a medium, to make sure I wasn't falling out of it. I wear a 36D bra. Size 6-8 pants. It fits perfect. The material is great. Padded bra and extra coverage in the front on the bottoms. So glad I made this purchase!",5
522717,I did not know it would come in a special box. It was so sweet even though I bought for myself it had an I love you bean in it. A very well made and sturdy piece. Its heavy and I love it. It reminds me what I'm made of.,5
421132,"I was very disappointed in this item, from the minute I saw the cellophane bag wrapper, to after closer inspection of the chain and pendant. Nowhere is Swarovski mentioned in the package or on the pendant, and I can see why. If those are even crystals, they are too small to see. This thing looks like it came out of a gum ball machine. I wouldn't have paid $3.00 for it once I saw it, let alone over $30. Thank you Amazon for your usual excellent customer service, especially your awesome return policy.",1
852478,"Love this dress... quality is great for the price. Been using as a maternity dress so I ordered a medium but think if my seamstress can't alter after pregnancy I'll have to get a smaller size because I love it too much.
Can be worn with or without leggings. .. it's super cute and I get lots of compliments in it",5
850506,"I am petite and I ordered a large,  It fits perfectly.  Why it is labeled as a regular tunic top in one place and then at check out they describe it as a maternity tunic top is beyond me.  I am not pregnant but ladies . . . it looks fantastic over leggings and jeans.",5
764548,"I don't usually post reviews, but my boyfriend loves it so much, I thought I should share. He claims its so comfortable, he hardly ever takes it off. He's about 6'0 and 150lbs and I got him a large. The sleeves were a little long, but he just cuffs the and it looks great. Definitely great quality for the price; would buy again.",5
24087,"This is our 4th baby but my first time with Baby Soy.  I bought the 0-3 months...now on to 3-6.  I love the cute prints and how soft the material is.  Very well made and a nice change from the big chain/market stuff (i.e., Carter's).  Love the snaps and recommend the bundler/one piece options as they are so versatile.  Love these pieces so much....would consider a 5th as they would stand up to handing down.",5
382568,"So I bought this beautiful dress to wear over my swim suits this summer... I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!
The colors are exactly what I wanted. I also wear a size 0, xs, and small and I'm 5ft even. It fits me so perfect!
Definitely worth the money spent.
Thank you thank you!!
It's so cute ladies!

All the bad comments didn't phase me at all. It's perfect for my little body.",5
676233,"The leveret pajamas are favorites of the baby!  They are cotton so aren't too hot or too cold.  They shrink a tiny bit so I recommend getting a slightly bigger size.  But the baby is SO Much happier in cotton than in polyester, particularly in warmer weather.  The product washes well and if very cute!",5
686658,The colour is amazing and the fit is more than I expected. This is my first pair of Asics and Ive made the switch from Adidas and Saucony. *the Saucony sneakers are comfy but these are on another level of comfort for me. Light wieght and the arch support in these are perfect for my feet. And as usual great shipping and packaging from Shoebacca,5
330851,"Just received my Mountain Made gloves.  Opened them up. And here are my first impressions

-well made, stiitching is nicely done.
-palm covering is soft and looks durable.
- fit for me is very good.  This is subjective but seem good for me
- I didn't realize there were hand warmer pockets.  These are large enough to hold a drivers license and some cash on a warmer day
These feel warm.  It's 55 today so I can't really test them.  So far very happy with the purchase.  Looking forward to trying the, out snowboarding and winter climbing/camping.",4
274378,"Fabulous! Fits great, looks great, and love the ratchet mechanism. I love the easy release mechanism; better than the other slide belt I own. Only downside was that getting the buckle installed on the belt was a little tricky ... had to go find a pair of pliers to lock it down.",5
115556,"Waaaay too much poof.  I am going to cut off and sew in a foot or two of the material myself.  I do like the color and fit at the waist, but  I feel like my hips have grown 2 feet outward when I wear it because of the poof.",3
449617,Fits well. Strong and sturdy. The stones are not shiny at all. They have like a mat finish. So I am looking for some way to Goss up the stone. But for what I paid for it it's worth it  I like heavy chunky jewelry  This fits the bill,5
368224,"I loved this dress! I got many compliments in Vegas! The dress did rise as I walked, (hips and butt will cause that lol). However, I didn't like the circles that attached the adjusters. I had them replace w/ clear ones from my alteration lady. I got a large to be safe & glad I did!",4
114716,"The skirt is definitely longer than in the picture. If you want a skirt above your knees, order a size down. I still gave it 4 stars because the color is beautiful and it's still wearable (it appears shorter if I hike it higher up my waist and wear a camisole over it). So in the end I suggest it :)",4
127468,"This costume is wonderful! XS was the only size left, thank god it fits. The ankles are a little too tight, and the foam padding had a few dents. The zipper is a little difficult, and the mask is too big and hard to see out of. But the fabric is soft and it looks damn sexy on. I can't wait to wear this on Halloween!",4
873777,"I purchased these based on other clothing I have by this brand.  These are too small and scratchy.  Plus I don't think they had an elastic waist.  I don't like tie only waist bands.  And these run smaller than other jogger pants I own in this brand.  I have L and they fit fine - just slightly small, so I figured XXL would be plenty big, but they were not.  They are not the smooth comfy cotton that my other pants by this label are.",2
599172,This product is beautiful. Very thin and sheer material. My issue with it. Is that it did not state whether it was Asian size and i was offered the option to purchase xl. I did but I received was a xs. This material has no give. It looks to be a junior small.,1
401225,"I'm a big dude and have been searching high and low for a sling bag that is made for larger frames.
I looked at this bag many times and was put-off by the way the shoulder strap was held together by velcro, so I looked more and more.
I broke down and got; its actually a well made bag and the strap doubles over into itself before it's locked in with velcro. Even with a full pack, the strap held, didn't even show signs of stress from the weight.
The Navy was a good color too. Great bag all in all.",5
587456,"Santa brought this for my 11 year old daughter and it was her favorite gift!  (It even ranked above her new tablet!)  After reading others' reviews Santa purchased her a large and it fits similar to a 16/18 in girls clothing size.  The pullover sweatshirt is a silky/nylon not cotton and it seems to be very good quality.  Haven't washed it yet but doesn't look like it would be a problem.
We just shopped at Justice today and the emoji shirt there was a far cry from the cuteness and quality of this shirt.",5
772635,"I really like this set even though they don't ""match"".  The colors are pretty true to color of the picture.  The one thing that disappoints me is that the bracelet is so big, I can't even wear it and according to the description, this should have fit my small wrist perfectly.",4
369371,The sz chart with the specific one I bought was wrong. I had a feeling it was but I read the reviews and went off those on who picked what sz and they were wrong too! I have a 38 in waist.... GET A LARGE!! DO NOT TRUST THE AMAZON SZ CHART!,1
18212,For some reason these are the only aviators that fit my narrow face.  Some people might not like how small they are but with the petite size and regular size I look like a bug in this style.  These work for me.  This is my second pair.  I lost the first purchase.  You can't beat the price.,5
166795,"Great product, love the fit. I wear a size 4, 26/27pant and am 5'7'' 140lbs. The flash mode are bright pink in color. XS fits tight, Smalls fit loose.
To add- these have outlasted my Lucy pants. I was embarrassingly told at the gym that my backside was see through. So then I went through the closet and tested all of my workout pants. I have 3- 90 degree pants, one pair has been through half marathon training and two bodybuilding preps and they are still not see through. They are seriously worth the price!",5
12801,"These inserts give firm support in the arch.  I was experiencing shin pain and these have helped significantly. Despite the good support, I expected more cushioning than this support provides.  If you're looking for more cushioning than support, I would look for a different product with that specific feature. Otherwise, great product and good price.",5

no room for business cards either.  the snap closure isn't as strong is another downer.  so not only is it THIN but the closure is flimsy.",2
45914,"I'm very happy with my purchase! I am 5'1"", 115 lb. I bought XS and it fits perfectly well. I am always really skeptical of costume sold online, but the quality of this skeleton cat-suit is wonderful! I will be willing to wear it for a few times, rather than just one!",5
858819,I bought a large as I usually wear a medium but the sleeves were tight. It is very pretty but so sheer it needs a camisole. Also the photo shows it coming to the hips on the model. I am 5 feet tall and it just came below my waist. I gave it away yo a woman who wears a small and it looks nice on her.,3
489321,"I love the colors in this scarf and bought 3 of them in different colors.  However, there was a strong dye smell that resulted in having to soak and wash these scarves about 7 times in hot water and a lot of detergent.  Other than that they are lovely, are of a nice fabric and they arrived on time from the seller.",5

366752,"Dress fit perfectly! Ladies, be sure you know your fitting sizes because that is super helpful and keeps your from ordering the wrong size. Don't just blindly order the size you think you are, order the size you KNOW you are and all will be well. GREAT quality too! You do in fact need to buy a slip to keep from showing your undergarments. Totally NOT a big deal because you'll end up needing that slip for some other dress in the future. I would DEFINITELY recommend this dress ;)",5
477105,"I got a petite XL hoping that the top would fit and not be too long.  It's perfect!  Very nice quality and fits great.  The print goes with so many different color pants and shorts, jeans, very versatile.  I will be looking at more Caribbean Joe clothes in the future.",5
107373,"I got this ring in the mail, I was super excited that it showed the symbol but on the sides it read ""How to use it Deathnote"" I mean that is very strange. If i knew it said that I wouldn't have bought it. next time take pictures of the ring around and everything so people know what they are buying. Other than that, its still a good ring. I give it 4/5 stars",4
503817,Love love love!!!! I'm in love with this dress!!! It's perfect its loose flowly it's not tight perfect for spring and summer. I read the reviews and every wrote how this dress was super short on them well I'm 5'3 and it came down right above my knee so it was a perfect fit & cute dress for my family photos later this month. ,5
8262,"it's a cheap costume wig- sheds, and has a very visible hairline that I suppose you can pick some curls over to disguise. The curls are very tight. the wig is also really shiny and looks more like a bad perm than an afro.

For halloween or on a budget I suppose you could work with it- gently shake some powder into it to dull the shine and pick the curls out just a bit. Otherwise, spend a little more ($20) and get a better synthetic wig- this is junk.",2
164986,"Great quality for price. On my 5' petite body, these are actually more of a regular to slight ankle length. They run small. I'm a size 2 and bought a small and they're still tight in my opinion around the waist, which gives a spanx effect (great if that's what you're going for). I might buy mediums for more comfortable days. If wearing as regular length pant, the hems flair a tiny bit since they're the width of the mid-calf not lower calf.",5
350038,"These socks have transformed my flying experience, and are also great for long car rides.  I used to arrive from a long flight or long drive with swollen feet, that didn't get back to normal for a couple of days.  With these socks that doesn't happen, and they aren't uncomfortable, either.  Last month at the airport in Dublin I noticed another lady putting hers on and we both enthused over how much we love these Dr. Scholl's sox.",5
67315,Still cute but I was disappointed in size. Will be measuring and checking carats from now on. Lightning deal had me rushing but I like it esp for the price. Green amethyst is very faint and mine looks a little more on the limeish side than the clear/blueish hue the pic has. Have been wearing it without taking it off since Xmas and no problems yet.,5
473342,"I ordered a medium and it fits perfectly. I am 5'5"", 112 lbs. It is warmer than I thought it would be, and even though I had beer spilled on me the first week I wore it, the beer rolled right off the fabric and didn't stain or soak into it. Score!",4
152119,"It fits a lot larger than I expected. I haven't decided if I will return it for a smaller size yet or not. The waist tie is kind of flimsy. The rest of the dress however looks fantastic. It's a pretty casual design, but I expect this to be a regular dress for me.",4
781773,"I love this style dress and usually purchase it two sizes larger than my daughter's normal size(this brand tends to run small, anyway).  That way, it's a dress one year, and then it's a tunic with leggings, and then sometimes a long shirt with bicycle pants.  Cute and wellmade.",5
330335,Pretty pissed off. Cute that the description changed AFTER I wasted my money. I bought this because it originally said 16 AND 14 GAUGE... That was a lie. I bought this because it was cheap even if I had to toss out half of them for being 16 and I only cared about the 14s... Super glad I have a million useless pieces of body jewelry now.,1
465711,"Once I received this product I was disappointed with the material, the feel of it, and the overall look is not what I was hoping for. I thought this would work well for me as I have a small physique like a lot of the models that are modelling the clothing however this was not the case. I was aware that it was a one size only but I didn't think it would be as awkward looking as it is. Ye for inexpensive but Ne for wear.",1
692690,"This wig was a huge hit at the Halloween party.  There were ladies there that couldn't believe the fantastic price on this and claimed it was a MUCH more expensive wig.  Fit well and was relatively comfortable all evening.  I'll definitely use this one again.  To my surprise, after the evening's event, I was able to completely brush this out easily, and put it away for next time.  I've never seen a long wig ""de-tangle"" before, but this was easy and beautiful.",5
695785,"The cloth of the belt feels quite nice and flexible. I could have had it be just a touch narrower at the tip so it would slip through my belt loops easier (as it is, I tend to have to ""wiggle"" it through while trying to cinch it snug on my waist, not the easiest thing to do). The size of the ""D"" rings is fine for me. It fits my size 34-36 waist with just enough to spare that it is easy to tuck under/past my first belt loop.",4
222439,"I was super excited to get these rings at such a great price but was pretty disappointed when two of them sliced my knuckles due a tiny portion of untrimmed wire, one of the stones fell off before I even wore it, and all of them were glued at such an obviously incorrect angle. I figured at such a low price they obviously were not real gemstones and might need some maintenance down the road but I did not anticipate this much hassle. Do not recommend unless you enjoy COMPLETELY reconstructing other peoples' products.",1
359270,"The most comfortable lounge pants around! I'm 59 years old & a size 14 petite, so self-consciously, I don't wear these outside of the house, but I could if my ego allowed for it. I purchased the Xlg, but could get away with the large and still be comfortable. I was surprised that the elastic at the ankles keeps the legs off the floor - not sure how they'd be on a long legged gal.",4
19394,My baby has a 95th-percentile head circumference and regular baby hats do not fit. This is a great hat because of the string that allows you to tighten/loosen the circumference according to your baby's head size (this also means it will grow with your baby). Nice wide brim keeps the sun out of his face and off his ears and neck. I'm very happy with this hat!,5
718879,Exceptional piece of jewelry. I bought this for my significant other and he loves it. The chain is nice looking and sturdy. I have to say that the gold and silver(titanium steel)together really look sharp on him. The eagle is well made and the writing is clear and not blurred like some biker jewelry. Well worth the price.,5
259095,"We've used the iPlay swim diaper for both our daughters, but this is the first time using the one with snaps. I really like the snaps, they make it so much easier to take the bottoms off when they're soaking wet without having to scrape down my little's legs. I wish I'd known of these sooner.",5
849225,"This dress is so adorable, I had great fun wearing it to a retro party I was invited to. I read the mix reviews, but I was lucky, mine fit perfect (I'm not a small size) and it was very well made. I received a lot of compliments.  It's also perfect for any summery event.",5
824983,Wheel broke off the first time the suit case was used.  It was loaded approximately 32 pounds and the entire case cracked around the wheel when the bag was removed from the car and placed on the ground. Obviously a manufacturing defect that was passed on the the consumer.  This suitcase is extremely poor quality and would certainly never survive  handling by an airline or cruise ship .,1
734989,"I LOVE the beads....but after wearing this bracelet only twice....the stretchable band stretched out to the point where it looks like it may break any minute.... I will have to restring it myself... Not complaining about the quality of the beads, but rather the quality of the string. Wish this company could have used stronger or better quality stretchable band because I would have order a bracelet in every color!",3
706948,For some reason magnetic snap would not stay closed very well. Especially with any coins in the wallet. I ended up returning it bc if i put anything else like more cards or money it in- then it would definitely never stay closed. Very sad about it bc the wallet was absolutely gorgeous! I ended up getting one not suede (I think its canvas?) and that stays closed much better.,1
533574,"I'm 5'6"", 130 pounds, measurements 37x29x38, bra size 32DD. I ordered XXL based on China recommendations, but this suit was too long and not tight enough to support the girls. If I didn't have to pay return shipping I'd try another size because the quality is great for that price.",3
190450,"I ordered  medium-sized  it fix, but small  in shoulder area and i don't  know why  it stop  above  my knees  cuz im 5.5 not tall little bit  heavy in my hips area that  could be the cause all my dresses are  the  same  anyways
other than that  i have NO negative  thing to  say about this dress  its good for everything",5
433873,"Great quality, holds up to washing, true to size and cute patterns. I have two pairs. Just as nice as comparable GapKids pjs at half the price. Wish I'd discovered these when my older daughter was small. Plan to order these and skip Old Navy and Gap altogether going forward.",5

ENJOY!!!!!",5
775237,"This shirt had a cool design hence why I bought it. After it arrived, I immediately noticed the front image wasn't white, but a very dark gray color. It was like wearing a plain black t-shirt. The material was also uncomfortable and the size was very awkward. Waste of money, don't buy.",2
196322,"Uuuaaaauuu.... I really love it!
The delivery was earlier than supposed to be!
I was so anxious to try and see how was fitting. And I'm so happy.
I'm Brasilian and as Brazilian girl, I've a larg hips and my boobs are normal. So, on my hips, fit so well even With the Small one and on my boos , was a little bit bigger but it's ok!
I really recommend and I'm going to buy more colors!",5

76780,They are great as long as the lense stays in. within a minute the lense popped out and I am unable to get it to stay in endless I glue it in. Maybe should go with a different design. I loved them when the lense was in but just frustrated.,1
428778,I bought this for my daughter to take on her trip to Puerto Rico.  She actually wore it and received many compliments on it.  I love the fact that it protected her face from the sun.  This hat traveled great. She crunched it in her suitcase and you can't tell.,5
30259,I loved the tight the1x-2x fit great for anyone 5ft 5 inches. I way 227 and they were a prefect fit. I just wish they had the red and white striped ones in 1x-2x. I would but them in a heart beat. The black and white ones where great with my Alice And wonderland costume.,5
260960,Bug eyes! Is what my teenagers said when I showed them my pretty purple over sunglasses. I asked if its better than clip one & both said no. Sadly returning them even though the dark grey lens & purple marbled frame is very attractive - just not on my face.  My large prescription glasses tightly fit inside which might damage the frames over time if I kept it.,2
67942,"I had to send back 2 bags that did not work for for me. I wanted to beable to fit my regular size I-Pad with smart cover and other regular purse things. This fit the bill perfectly. It is very nice leather. Not flimsy at all. Lots of zipper pockets for keys, phone, I-pod etc...and a backpack to boot. LOVE IT!!!!",5
409112,"This ring is nice, heavy and handsome. It's stones are beautiful and I don't have any fears of anything falling out! I was kind of surprised by the color though. From the descriptions I've read, I thought it'd look like silver, but it doesn't. It has a bluish cast to it that sets it apart. Handsome none the less. WELL worth the price! Shipped fast, too. True to size, the comfort band is a must! Overall, happy with my purchase.",4
68855,"My daughter wears a 6.5 shoe, so I ordered a 6 and a 7. Unfortunately, she has a very narrow foot and the 6 was way too wide for her. It definitely wouldn't have stayed on in the ocean. I sent both pairs back. Too bad because they were cute shoes! The pink is a really bright pink. Almost neon.",4
32972,"This T shirt was purchased for a gag Christmas gift, but when it arrived yesterday I was surprised and disappointed by the poor quality of the garment. The material is very lightweight, the overall dimensions for the size are small (even though I purchased a large for someone who wears a medium, I am almost afraid it may still be too small). It's probably too late to get another one elsewhere now. Oh well, Merry Christmas.",2
76043,"I wear mine everyday. I'm in my fifth month and haven't had to buy any maternity pants yet thanks to it. I made the mistake of going cheap and buying the Basic (without the silicone strip) first- I never wear that one because it is useless and spends most of the time rolled up around my stomach or ribs. The Everyday BellaBand is thick, stays put, and I can see getting months more use out of it. I'm buying a second so I don't have to remember to wash mine every night.",5
882201,This is definitely the best bathing suit I have ever owned. I love that I can have the option to wear it has a tankini or a bikini. The best thing is that it does not shrink after washing! Ive had more expensive tankinis that lost their shape or the top would shrink. Even discolor. I will probably order one in every style!,5
866014,"It does say it's a compression shirt but it's nowhere near other compressions shirts I have. The material doesn't feel of quality tbh, I don't think this shirt is worth what I paid for it, at all. I would've much rather spent 10 more bucks and having gotten a Nike or Adidas shirt. Very disappointed with the product",2
87098,"I really like it, it fits well, but the shoulders are poofier than in the picture and the bow sits more on your bust than above it. If you have a smaller chest it would probably be okay, but on a girl like me it looks awfully Christmassy. I wear it around Christmas. Also, the ribbon from the bow extends down to the waist and not just like 4 inches like in the photo.",4
270839,"I absolutely love these jeans.  I was worried about the fit, but when they arrived today I put them in right away! Perfect fit! Great quality!!!! And LOTS os stretch!!!! I am a short girl with a thicker lower body, so buying jeans is hars sometimes.... my butt ALWAYS seems to come out lol, but not with these.  They are midwasted so my botty is covered completely.

10945,"Based on the sizing chart, my slim 14 year old is at the lower end of the scale for the 16/18 size. The 16/18 fit him perfectly. Unless your child is slim then I do not think that these boxers will fit. My son has slim legs and the legs are a snug fit. The quality of the fabric is not as thick as mens CK underwear but it is soft and okay for the price.",4
120388,Fit great and looks super cute! Make sure you get them with the side snaps as that feature really comes in handy when putting them on and taking them off. My daughter has pretty small buns so I ordered her correct size. If your child isn't small you may want to order up.,5
882851,"Fabulous! Usually an 18, hips 48"", ordered size 20 and they're perfect. If I wanted as tight as the pix, I'd get the 18. A little short-- just rest on top of foot--but I'm 5'9"". Just ordered a 2nd style last night. Great quality & price. Also great customer service!",5

- nice finish, looks great
- sturdy metal clasp
- holds cards pretty tight

Its flexible-ish, very hard - took forever to get in since I needed some curve - had to keep bending over and over for ~20 mins b4 it stayed slightly bent long enough for me to get in.  Got it in, put retaining ball back on, walked 100ft and felt wrong - checked, retaining ball gone (I hadn't even trimmed it yet so can't blame me) - never found.  Took out, put down on counter, heart fell off - what a joke!!",1

It took a while for the shirt to arrive as expected, but when it arrived the XL fit like a Small or Medium.  Good luck getting a full refund.  The vendor will refund you $7 and let you keep the shirt (even though it does not fit).",3
77727,I was in medical training during my twin pregnancy and had to be on my feet a LOT. This provided support and comfort. I was also surprised to discover it provided a good place for me to tuck my scrubs in place without the uncomfortable sensation of a tight string around my belly!,5
550196,This skirt is super cute! I wear it all the time. The color is just like the picture and was not disappointed when it came. I get tons of compliments on it and people always ask where I bought it. It is not to puffy and goes great with almost everything. Do not spend $30 plus dollars at retail stores for a tulle skirt because this one is way better than any other of the skirts that I have found.,5
376447,"You can cut it to the desired length very easily.  It is then put together (belt to buckle), also very easy to do.  Looks classy.  The only thing to be aware of is to slightly push and hold the belt further through the buckle (to release a bit of pressure holding the buckle in place before pressing the release button to loosen the belt.  This is a matter of ""knowing,"" not a matter of quality that would diminish my score of five stars.",5

782670,"I got these for my 3-year old granddaughter for Christmas and she loves them! Of course, she's into the princess thing right now. She even wants to wear them to bed!

The colors are nice and girlie. I have a feeling her parents are going to have to keep up with the laundry so she doesn't run out!

Her dad said they were hard to unwrap from the plastic ties - each one was rolled up! Why do they do that?? (I just bought some undies that were taped in a roll.... sigh...)",5
845422,"Best socks Ive ever worn! Better than other no shows because of the extra coverage further up the top of the foot rather than at the toes, which makes for a much more comfortable fit under the shoe. I also like how thin and breathable these are, but still well made enough that they don't tear. And the silicone piece on the heel is great so they stay in place and don't slip down in the back during walking. Overall, the best socks Ive owned! Already bought 10+ pairs to replace all my old socks.",5
46084,"These are great sunglasses.  There is no apparent distortion, they shield the sides of your eyes as well as the front and they offer good wind protection. Because they fit over glasses and have sides that grip your head, they do require movement from time to time to avoid discomfort over the ears.  I'll buy another pair.",5
290943,"It is a awesome outfit and for the price definitely worth it. My only complaint is it was still a little too big even though i got a small, and i wear a medium in all other clothes. (I was also expecting a little bit more spandex material but no complaints on how it is)",5
468311,Absolutely terrible!  It says Sherpa lined but should say thin terry cloth And see through flannel. The sizing chart listed is off. Supposedly they run small so an alternate sizing chart is given. It's worthless as well and not accurate. The overall look of the jacket is correct but there is absolutely NO Sherpa lining. The picture shows a fluffy warm lining which is NOT what the hoodie has. Don't waste your money!,1
693306,For the average female this hijab fits great for a one piece. If your face is a little larger you can cut out and hem the material just below the chin and hem it. The material and construction is very high quality. This is a great price for a hijab of such high quality and I highly recommend this to purchase for everyone.,5

I am 36dd and 31 inch waist and a large fit me with room to fill. I'm 5 foot and it does go below my knees, a little big longer than I would want, but I'm short so to be expected. Super cute, I would definitely buy again.",5

It's usually 50/50 on whether it's going to fit or not. In this case I chose a large because it said sz  12 in U.S. End result, the shirt is loose fitting, which is unusual for Chinese clothing! it's soft & great with leggings. I like the shirt I chose the pink & also plan on getting the blue. Recommended!",5

I found then to be a little large for me (although I am loosing weight) So I ordered a medium (waiting for those to arrive) I do like the weight of the material and the feel. I would recommend the to my friends for sure they feel really good on and silky.,5
136619,"It's okay for the price. With really, really cheap stuff from Yazilind, expect chains to snap and parts to break easily. I wouldn't recommend this as a gift for these reasons. If it's for your own use, and you have reasonable expectations, it's very pretty costume jewelry that requires repair to you want to wear it more than a couple times.",3
235549,"This works well for credit cards and business cards.  It seems sturdy and looks like it will hold up well.  However, it is not clear plastic (it's more of a ""frosted"" look) and thus does not work well for any wallet photos you might wish to keep in it. (Plus the design would easily bend them since they stick out of the pocket a bit.)  But for credit cards and the like, it is great!",5
690396,"I spotted this item in a gift shop. Loved it had to have it drive off with regrets.
Looked up the brand on my favorite place AMAZON.
Bought it, love it. I contacted the seller to see if it came in navy blue but knowing it is recycled material they were wonderful in their response but I have it say when this is different lighting it looks blue or charcoal or even grey. Sturdy, well made. Can't wait to use this on my vacation trip to Texas.
Perfect size handles are sturdy leather. Nicely made!
Highly recommend this product and the seller.",5

Just ordered a second pair in another color!,5
661541,The top is not quite like the picture. The neck is rounded and in the picture it looks pointed. And I knew to order larger.... Where in any store I would get an Xl I ordered a 4xl here. Honestly I wasn't expecting much when buying this and my expectations were right. The bottom wasn't too bad.,2
393820,I ordered these sunglasses for myself but they were to big for my face so I gave them to my brother. Sorry they didn't work out for me but happy for him because he was excited to get them! He spends the majority of the day outdoors or driving for his job and he says these sunglasses deliver on cutting out sun glare and protection.  Happy with this purchase.,5
67267,"I originally rated this as a three. The ring is really pretty. However, it's a lot more delicate than I expected it to be. I bent it the first day I had it just from normal wear.

I love the design but I wish these were available in larger sizes.",3

I definitely recommend this for the MM size LV Neverfull bag.",5
280475,Best purchase I've ever made. I bought these for a vacation where I would be doing a lot of walking and my feet were very thankful. The tops rubbed my feet a bit but I was going from winter to summer in one day (South American summer) so my feet just weren't used to wearing sandals in January. Other than that these are soo comfortable and so far pretty sturdy. They look good with different types of outfits too. Wish Vionics were cheaper but they are so worth the money.,5
48674,I absolutely love them. Fit perfectly over my glasses. I might order a few more pairs as a spares.  One for the car and another for my husband!  Only thing is they are a bit fragile ~ so have to be very careful with them.  I can see why the first pr became broken in th mail.  Gale Young,5

Also, like with most corsets that come with a thong, screw the thong, shit's stiff as cardboard, but its cute ;)",4

725853,"My wife is very pleased with this case. The colors match exactly what on-line pictures indicated it should be. The rubber piece that fits around the phone is flexible but sturdy.

Well made and looks expensive.  The only negative feature is the way the bands are held in place.
There are no elastic bands keeping them from staying in place, it uses a clip that the band slips onto, does the job but bands tend to slip free from time to time,",4

Had I gotten a 3XL it probably would have fit perfectly but I'm keeping as is.  It works.,5

The quality of VS is really going down hill so these are at least as good in my opinion. I usually wear a size 6 pant and these fit me great....but I don't think they would be comfy past a size 8 or 10 depending on hip size.
My only complaint is the color choices. I wish you could by all one color instead of 5 different colors. But for $20 still a great deal!",5
115765,The shirt I received did not look like the shirt in the picture.  I went by the size chart and it was way to small to be worn as shown.  You will have to order a couple sized up for that.  Not worth the return shipping so now i just have a shirt I don't want.,1

Even being on SaLE waste of money Would not Recomment ANYthing from this company!",2
872834,"Prior to ordering I read the reviews and looked at the size chart.  Still way off.  :(
Bottoms were slightly big but the top was ginormous!  Not to mention, it'd be helpful if you are a contortionist to properly get the top on-definitely advise getting the top on in a private roomy area (not a tiny bathroom stall).  Oh and the straps were not ""X"" back like pictured",2

We returned it to buy a nicer looking one, but of course the one that replaced it cost over twice as much. All depends what your looking for, if your looking for something cheap buy it, if your looking for something nice buy one that cost twice as much.",3

This is simply two pieces of thin material (not sure of the makeup) one of which has ten little six inch tucks in it, sewn together at the shoulders and sides.  No shape at all.  I was so disappointed that I packed it up and sent it back.  Something I have never done before.",1

i can also store my diamond tester on top of the vials inside of the lid. the stock picture is a little misleading as it appears to
show the dividers as wood and in my box they are not. the dividers in my box appear to be either pressed cardboard or
masonite. either way the dividers seem to be very sturdy.

I usually bring out green from cheap jewelry and this is still pure looking. Even under gloves in the summer heat(sweaty)it leaves no trace on my skin.
It is elegent and funky at the same time. It is not flat to my skin it stands up a bit. I really like it and even if it breaks I will be buying another one.",5

I have now worn these for 3 hours and the inner thigh area has ripped and ran!!!!!!  WTH!!!!!!  DONT GET THESE LADIES ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A BOARDERLINE size 10 even!!!!!

However, the fabric is not terribly comfortable. I purchased a Large hoping for a little give as I am 60 and just don't have time to sacrifice comfort for style. It won't be worn very often for anything other than a costume piece. Will probably give it to someone younger and smaller. I am long waisted, and this hits at about my natural waist.",3

I normally go for huge tote bags, so I was a little afraid to buy this since it's a lot smaller than what I'm used to. But, it still holds a lot and forces me to not carry all the unnecessary things. Everyone compliments it!",5

After a few weeks of icing and wearing these inserts,  I am much better.  The key is arch support for heel issues.  I bought other inserts as well and I will give my opinion on them as well.  Overall I spent about 90 bucks on 3 different brands and I am very happy as I saved at least 300 bucks.",4

Issues: The arms are a bit sung and the stitching under the arms was slightly coming apart before I wore it  - Nothing a little needle and thread can't fix.

Shipping: It arrived a day after it was supposed to so if your in a rush to get this make sure you order it with a little time.

Recommendations: I recommend wearing a slip or a camisole under for a little extra coverage around the chest.",4
23116,I bought this to stretch a pair of work boots that I got last year for Christmas and haven't been able to wear because they were to tight. Well they fit perfect now after one night of stretching with this boot stretcher. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has the same problem.,5

BTW:  It arrived a day early!  Not bad, Amazon!!!",4

In fact, it isn't worth it to me to buy the one from the doctor because the insurance company will only pay for one per year and it wore out before that. By contrast, Powerstep Pinnacle will last for years even if used in hiking boots or other heavy use, it is way cheaper than the one from the doctor, and it is almost a good.",5

So now I know, and I won't make the same mistake for future Allegra K purchases. I kept the top, even though it is a little bit big, but not crazy big, since it was SO inexpensive, but really good quality everything. I recommend it. I don't give it a 5 only because it is cuter on the model than on me.",4
383660,I gave these leggings to my daughter.  She likes the Plus size because they are loose and not binding.  They go down to her ankles because she's kind of short.  So these capris were perfect for her.  I ordered a pair of regular long length leggings for myself.  VERY SOFT and comfortable!,5
43060,"This product is cheap both in price and quality.  The good: it's very lightweight and comfortable.  The bad: they break real easy so you have to consider them disposable.  They did the job as required but due to the fact they they don't have much shelf life, I probably won't purchase again.",3

I would highly recommend",5

52934,"This is a great wide brim sun hat. I ordered a 2T-4T for my almost 3 year old. It fits as expected. The only downside is the brim becomes extremely floppy when wet and would completely cover her face at times, which annoyed her and made her take it off. When the hat is dry it is perfect sun protection.",4

We took a tuck in the pockets so they are a little less noticeable and now the pants are wearable.  Very comfortable.  My son is 5'7, 110 ...the small fit him well.",4
744183,"This product fit fine, but it wasn't exactly in the greatest condition. It had a small black dot near the bust line & some of the fabric is cut in a jagged way, so it's not very even. Other than that it was fine and pretty much what I expect for the price.",3

For the price, quality and looks, i definetly recommend it :) (i event went skiing with it)",4

The front is cut so low and is very open. It gapes widely no matter how you try to adjust the top portion. I think the model must have it pinned. Unless you want your entire bra (or chest!) to show, it's not really wearable. I suppose you get what you pay for. I think this item was under $10. Buyer beware.",1

WONDERFUL!
I am very impressed with the quality of this bikini! I was trying to treat myself for the summer since I have been working hard at the gym! This was nicely priced and looks amazing!
The bottoms are bit tight if you have a butt, but I kinda just pulled up the bottom ( cheek area ) up a little to give a little more room without exposing too much. Looks great and I can't wait to wear more!
Fast shipping too!
Thank you!!",5
300126,Just as described in the description. I replaced my metal ring with this to take on our vacation so I don't loose my wedding ring at the bottom of the ocean. I was expecting it to be a little stiffer based on the description but its very flexible and comfortable. Cant tell I have it on.,5

783760,The problem with these pants is that they changed the design. It now has a ribbed waist with a drawstring. It is nothing like the original design or like the photo. I have had to pay return charges and it's not right. The design in the photo should reflect the product which it does not. Very very disappointed. I have no idea why they would change a cool design to one with a ribbed waist for middle-aged women (which I am but I don't like). Not all of us liked the ribbed waist.,1

The liner does not feel very nice and it's easy to get sweaty and uncomfortable when the lining starts sticking to you. Overall, it's okay, kinda overpriced but looks pretty good.",3

This cardigan was purchased at a discount in return for this honest review!",5
314468,"I'm 16 on top and a 22 on the bottom. The 2X fit because the material has a a little bit of stretch to it.  However, it was snug enough through the midriff that I was uncomfortable.  I opted for the 3X for comfort. This had a beautiful color, I wished it had fit.",4
163962,These glasses shipped and delivered quickly and I was very happy with them! The lenses are very large but that is how I wanted them to be. They were also a little too big for my face but I found a YouTube hack to make them fit better and now they feel fine. I think that these are great glasses for the price!,5
676429,"Four stars for great styling and shaping, minus one however because the garment is unlined and the fabric weight and sheen are highly reminiscent of a slip; the modest lace trim of my undergarments was clearly defined under this. It would work wonderfully as a base item to wear under tied on scarves.",4
75610,"Currently 5 months pregnant.  This is both supportive for the belly and a big help with work pants.  Also so far, comfortable to wear both folded in half and at full length (short to normal torso).  Definitely enough room to accommodate growth and provide light support.

Does not work as well with jeans (my jeans fit closely, and the zipper part digs into the belly), but I think this is more a function of the original narrow fit and the stiff denim.

Would recommend.",5
862308,"I took over a month to arrive!

I'm 5' 4"", 138lbs, 34DDD
This dress doesn't fit according to the sizing which was posted by the seller, instead it runs seriously very small. I typically wear a small-medium 6/8 in everything so I was comfortable ordering a medium, but sadly it was too tight in the chest and hip/tummy areas! The return process to China is expensive and not worth the costs invoulved.

The dress is a very light weight and almost see through polyester/cotton fabric; the colors are vivid and pattern is attractive!",3
233291,"Absolutely LOVE this wallet!  Have always been a fan of MK and bought the bag (which is EXACTLY the same color as this wallet) 3gears ago. It's been a great buy and just gets softer. The wallet is roomy, well made, and so classy.  Delivery was super quick. The price was terrific and the circle design on it matches my purse!  I'll check Amazon from now on before I even go to a MK outlet.",5
216462,"Hat itself was good. Would have liked to keep it. However, was damaged when arrived.  Top off hat was torn and the brim was bent. THerefore sent it back. Never wore it to see how it held up.  Purchased a Hemlock hat instead.  Much sturdier and better built.",3
66580,"EXACTLY what I wanted!! It really is 100 different tongue rings, all kinds of colors and patterns, I am really impressed especially for the price. They say sergical steel but the bars do seem alot lighter than my other bars, so I'm just switching the balls on my current bar because I know its high quality (my skin is very sensitive!!)",5
176550,This is a real cute swim suit. The problem is I don't think it's woman size. I think it's kids size. I'm 5 ft 5 in and ordered going by size chart.the tied part that goes around your neck didn't even go over my chest. This might fit a 5ft person. Since I paid  $10 you have to pay $3 for shipping to return. Not a happy lady.,1
299710,"I love this costume! It's fits pretty nicely. I'm 5'6"" and 130 pounds, I normally wear a 4 in dresses, and I ordered a size small. It's very cute! Just needs some irnoning because of wrinkles caused by the packaging. Other than that, seems like a high quality product. ",5
763132,This ring is awesome.  I had to buy one because I am so clumsy and left handed.  I have knocked the stones out of my platinum ring set and it is way to expensive to have to keep replacing the diamonds.  So I chose this set.  It is similar to my real ring.,5
76030,I researched these band things and this one seemed to be the best. After I got my order and tried it on it is very comfy and fits very well to hide my unbuttoned jeans. I didn't know it was good to wear for the entire pregnancy and post pregnancy until I read the box it came in which I thought was pretty cool. I love it and will probably order another one!,4
473627,"Great color and fit (although vey small). I'm 5'4"" and 120 lbs. with very little butt. I usually wear a 0 at most places (Gap, Limited, Kut From the Kloth, etc.), so based on reviews got a 7 and they stretched out after wearing them for about 15 minutes. I exchanged them for a 5 and they are perfect! Great pants once you find your size!",4
393574,"Definitely not equal in quality to VS or other brand name lacy thongs.  They were so cheap, I'll keep them, but they run smaller than better known brands and the quality is just not that great.  Strings hanging off seams, seams are weak, small holes develop quickly.  I would not buy again.",3
408532,"I purchased three of these shirts in different colors (black, dark green and charcoal grey) in XL.  They are all comfortable and are a good fit, however the green and grey ones fit a bit more snug than the black one.  I would definitely buy the black shirt again. comfortable and retains its shape. BIG PLUS - NO ITCHY TAGS!",4
224962,"I really do like this bag a lot, but there are a few issues so far. The back zipper wasn't completely purple (looks like it was missed by the dye) and yesterday I noticed the strap is coming apart. Nice bag, just a bit disappointed it is coming apart so quickly (just got it last weekish). Disappointed that the zipper was mottled as well. Gave 3 stars because I like the functionality and size of it.",3
370492,"I've bought these rings about 5 or 6 times already, because I just love them so much. For $10, you honestly can't beat these rings. They don't last forever- I don't expect them to, but they do last a pretty long time for me. I put these rings through hell, water and constant use included, and they never fail to surprise me. I love them so much.",5
68749,"I bought these for my 2-year old daughter for our vacation.  They worked out pretty well.  They protected her feet at the beach, without causing any blisters or weird foot issues.  They can be a little snug and difficult to put on, but I'm not sure if that is how they are supposed to fit.  For the price, I liked them well enough to repurchase.  I am just sizing up this time to account for the small fit.",4
423413,"Bought two of these sunglasses and they both broke the same way within a year of normal usage.  There is a design flaw in the stems where the rubber inserts are positioned.  The plastic frames are weakened and break after repeated wearings.  Of course, my two both broke on the same left side so I couldn't even salvage a pair out of the two.",1
391225,Finally a nice comfortable fit for my  3X son (wt fluxes between 290 and 310).  All the shopping and returning I had to do until I hit on Kingsize Men's Bid & Tall. We're on opposite coasts so I have to shop his gifts online.  Maybe runs a bit large but he likes the loose fit.  I'm sticking to this brand for him going forward.,5

334345,"Over all I love this dress. I'm 5'3"" 165 pounds. My measurements are 42, 35, 41 and im a 38DDD. I ordered an XL. It fits pretty well, but my large breasts don't fit very well in the top part. It's a little bit small. But it fits great still and I love it, I order a blue one and I'm considering getting it in red also!!",5
391291,"Nice dress...but it is too small and pretty thin material. It's stretchy but does run small. I would have to order about 2 sizes up for this to fit. It is pretty and sexy but I will have to return. Based on the thinness of the material, I will not re-order. I can just imagine how it would look after a wash or two.",3

The beads have a nice finished look, and I've gotten a few compliments on the design.  overall Im really satisfied with my purchase.",5

These are my new favorite pajamas!
The only other problem is that they are made for really tall people, but it is easier to remove length than to add it. Would highly recommend them and considering ordering another pair!",5
325162,"Purchased this product in the teal and burgundy double pack as a Christmas gift to my other half. He really loves them both, especially the blue one, its his favorite color. The Burgundy in the picture is spot on, but the teal is a little deeper and brighter, if that makes any sense. They fit the way a beanie is supposed too. I occasionally wear the burgundy one with a few of my outfits. I'm REALLY debating on buying a few more universal colors that we can both share. Great products, happy customers. :D",5
676133,"Cute PJ's. They fit perfectly for me (5'4 size L). However I received with a hole in seam of leg. Good thing I examined before taking them on my trip.  I am returning today.

Also, some reviewers said they ran small so I ordered a 7 when I usually wear a 6 1/2. I have a half inch gap on the back. They're pretty comfortable so I bought some toe comfort heel gaurds and all is well",3

the heel is just right !",5
469984,"Very pretty and love the color. Ordered a size 6 thinking that my large busted daughter (34 C/D cup) who is a size 4 could fit. It fit in the bust, but too big in waist. Would be perfect for someone who is an average bust needing a size 6. Color true to what I saw on computer. It is like a teal, but a bit lighter.",4
317846,This is the absolute worst decision I've made when purchasing online. I'm 5'3 and I got a size small. I stops about 4 inches above my ankles. It looks like I'm wearing trousers from behind because it grips my behind but doesn't grip my waist. Its like they got a size small and medium mixed up and merged the two sizes together into one. Do not recommend. Extremely disappointed!!!,1

I ordered it and it came in time for New Year's, and we were both very happy with my choice.",5
139849,I've  tried  other one's  but this brand is the best so far ! Just remember  to wash well and use a alcohol  wipe before  placement. You will find that works best. The dress also had a bra top sewn  in so there was sort of a holding up effect. But there were no straps  and it was kind of low in the back .So this was a great fix for that,4
777283,"I LOVE this dress--so many compliments!  Only drawback is that if you wear anything larger than an A cup, you'll probably wish for more support. I don't feel comfortable with only one layer of the fabric up top, so, to make the halter, I wrap the fabric around my neck, then down the other side in front so there's two layers. I pull it down under the waist, then back up to tie in the back. This gives thickness and support.

Thinking about adding bra pads to alleviate the problem...still, beautiful, comfortable, flattering, and very feminine.",4

It definitely exceeded my expectations in terms of warmth -- it is just as warm and some of my much more expensive (brand name) winter hats. It looks great and fits well. I have a relative small/narrow head. I think it would easily stretch out to fit someone with a larger head as well.,5

Last time I put it on I was a doll!
Now I am a chunky burger and makes this dress look bad.
ASHAMED!

I'm 5'1"", 115lbs and the medium fits just right in everything except the length, which is common for me with monokinis.  I need to figure out a way to alter it to make the torso shorter so it doesn't bunch in the front but otherwise it fits great.  And the design is beautiful.  So glad I got this suit.",4

I think that the order was lost, so we had to contact the manufacturer, then pay for last minute alterations, which cost 4 times more than the dress.

These glasses are amazing, just as good as the bans IMO!the lens are glass and the frame is heavy and sturdy.... only thing I wish was different is that the gradient brown lenses were a little less see through from the outside.

I almost never write product reviews but this was worth it!",5

Additionally, the hole to blow them up is awful-used a hand pump but it was still difficult. It also could be my error, but I thought this was a pair and they are singles. Fortunately, I intentionally wanted to buy 2 pairs but ended up getting 1 since the price is per boot shaper.",1

409958,I bought this bracelet for my wife at Xmas.  She's a fairly picky woman so I was worried at first.  The main reason I picked it was it looked to match her Croton diamond watch perfectly.

It's a good thickness to so it will stand out a bit in that respect.,4

I know that colors can be off a bit, but this was beyond off.",3
266352,Great dress and fits comfortably. The odd thing about it is that the chest is a bit odd. I am a 34DD and you have to have the dress pulled low for it to correctly in the chest (which throws off the proportions of the dress). I will have to get a heavty push up or something because it's hot enough to figure something out for.,4

The material is comfortable and fits well in the legs

Don't know if this was an aberration or not, but it makes me very reluctant to order a T-shirt from Caf Press again.",1
643332,"Love this plugs they are a little bit shinny, but look fine to me what I didn't like is that they are bulky so they don't flat in the front as I expected, as some of the custom plugs I have, this ones are my favorite because I love the moon so I wear them almost every week, image will not fade if they have contact with water, and they are the exact size I ordered :)",5
334467,"Purchased this for my husband, who made the transition from a typical back pocket wallet to one he can keep in his front pocket as the back pocket wallet was causing back strain.  He LOVES this Slim Wallet that holds everything:  credit cards, id, money and says he would never convert back to the old style again.  Highly recommend to any guy who wishes to make a change to keeping wallet in front pant's pocket.",5
21895,I purchased this hat after my experience babysitting a boy who had one. This hat is the best protection for a baby. The brim of the hat protects their face but unlike a bucket hat still allows them to see. I only take off a star because you need to tie the string under baby's chin. A baby will fuss and it can be hard if you make it too loose or tight. A great feature is that it covers a baby's neck and has a upf of 50 so you don't need to get out the sunscreen.,4
830049,"Not sure where they got that picture. What I received was powder blue, not turquoise. The photo has lots of curls, but what I received is just brushed straight up into a teased lump at the top. The teasing is uneven so it makes your head look lumpy and weird. Truly terrible.",1
240603,"Nice ring.  it is very comfortable.  The price point was low enough that I could buy two in different sizes for my outdoor summer wedding ceremony.  I just wanted be sure that my wedding ring would fit, no matter how hot it was outside (because my fingers swell a bit in certain weather conditions, like humidity).",5
226531,Christmas gift for my wife she smiled and put it on and whore it the rest of the winter so it must have been a good hat or it would have been put in the box with all the rest of the hats and gloves she won't where or given to my daughter. its not a tight hat so it won't mess up her hair but its not so loose that a northern Minnesota winter will blow it off and it keeps her warm,5
174842,Really like the shirt. I had previously ordered a Large since the reviews say they run large. I normally wear a XL. The large was still a little loose and when I work out I prefer tighter clothes so I ordered a medium and it fits like a glove. Not to tight and not loose.,5
256120,"I love love love it. Only reason I gave it a 3 is cause I didn't realize the material would be totally see through. I do love the coffee color and it looks and fits great. Oh and a few ppl have tried to tell me that my skirt is riding up in the back even though it wasn't lol. Still, good buy for the price. Wish I would've gotten a better pic but better than nothing!",3

136340,"exactly as advertised. Glasses work well and fit as planned. They are very light in weight which is nice but, of course, the question is will they stand up to regular use.  The shade of the lens is lighter than I expected. THey may not work well in very bright sunlight.  Have not had a chance to test that as yet.",4
335135,This is a great one piece swimming dress. Size is slightly smaller than expected leaving me showing a bit more cleavage than I would like.

I pinned it on the side of my head and styled it so the ribbon was flatter against my head, as opposed to the model depicted.  It was the perfect topper and I got many compliments.  I was 100% satisfied with my purchase.",5
82971,I LOVE Wright Socks.  These frictionless socks absolutely save me when I do breast cancer walks where we walk 20 miles a day for 3 days in a row.  With the friction being between the sock layers instead of between the sock and my foot I did the entire walk with no blisters or hot spots.  AND they are very sturdy.  I have pairs that I have had for 8 years and they are still going strong.,5
666085,This dress is a beautiful blue - I have gotten many compliments on it. The lining is pretty sheer though; with a blue cami and leggings it was fine though. I would recommend this dress if you are layering. If you are looking to wear it on its own - you might be showing more than you'd like.,4
380468,I felt the plastic was thin and the overall quality was cheaply made. I returned this because I compared this to another one I bought back in 2013 but had to replace because my niece took it. Tried this because it was a few bucks cheaper and the reviews were good but this just doesn't compare. I'm buying the other one. Would gladly pay a few bucks more for better quality. The plastic was much thicker and more durable. The zipper was better quality...It was a ykk zipper on my previous one. The zipper on this one is cheap. Sorry....,1
737115,"Cheaply made. Tightening the string bunches up in the back. Not fluffy and not fit like the one in the picture. It's ok if you're not trying to look sexy. For context, I'm 5'3, 118lbs, 32dd, 25"" waist, and booty. It's just not as form fitting as I'd like with regard to fit. Bottom line, you're getting a cheap knock off of what's in the picture.",1
727664,"I was a tad bit disappointed that this ring only came in a little sealed baggie, but I had a ring box from a ring I ordered for myself lol. The ring is beautiful, but there was some black gunk on it when it arrived. I managed to scratch most of it off, but some stayed on the ""Mom"" part. I chose this Mom ring over one with cubic zirconia because its simplicity makes it beautiful. I know my mom will love this!",4

636643,This was WAY too small. The elastic that should be at the waist was just under my chest making the hem so short it's not appropriate for public. The back is sheer so you can't wear a bra. The stitching is horrible. Some of the lace ends weren't even sewn on at all.,1

After having my credit cards fall out in my pocket I stopped using it. I would not recommend this wallet to keep credit cards secure. I will try to find another COACH. A complete waste of my Amazon Gift Certificate.,1
548819,"I love love leggings! Having said that, these are not good. Way too small in the waist. I wear a large, ordered an xl and these are plain tight. I had to rip 'em off due to feeling like a busted can of biscuits. Two stars because they are opaque and the material is soft.",2
870631,"The swim suit is cheaply made, it runs VERY small. I ordered a 2x, the top fits more like a medium and the bottoms got more like a large, so they are not even proportionate. It took a long time for the suit to be delivered, which was expected, but I was highly disappointed in the quality and sizing differences. Luckily I had a friend who was able to wear the suit. If you have a larger chest, do not waste your time on this one!",2
56628,Great product! I think every pregnant woman needs these! I'm 5'6 and my pre pregnancy weight was 138#/athletic-hourglass shape- I ordered a size two and then a 3 for the late stages of pregnancy... Both work great and help smooth everything (I hate panty lines). The one draw back is the legs are a little long- so you can't really wear it under anything too short- but when you have a big ole belly who is wearing a mini skirt? Haha,5
38471,"Very comfy, plenty roomy! The legs are huge, I'm 5'4 & weigh about 120, bought a Medium, the waist is OK, mostly stays up, but the legs! I could store pillows in there while wearing them.

50819,"I really don't like this product! It's too short (I'm 5' 7"" and it didn't cover much of my torso). It also is very hot! It's uncomfortable and gives you a cylindrical shape with ni curves. It also shows under clothing very easily. The fabric creases like it said it would, but in doing that, it makes you look like you have really bad back fat rolls! LOL",2
569857,My daughter is gorgeous in this dress! She bought it for the winter formal but didn't go due to unseen circumstances. But I told her not to worry because the way its made allows for sizing fluctuation which makes it an absolute wardrobe must! She could wear this for years to come!,5

74714,"I'm a size 16-18 and these fit me okay. They seem stretchy enough when I put them on and they look good. The first 4 hours I wore them I was mostly standing with little walking. Once I got out and started walking around, the crotch kept sliding down to just above my knees and the fabric started bunching under my feet. I'll probably wear them again if I have another costume that requires them, but I doubt I'll wear them for day to day.",3
726383,"I'm a huge Lilo and Stitch fan. When I saw this on Amazon, I went crazy.

The faux leather material feels nice. The design feels nice and it's 3D, not a flat 2D picture printed on the wallet. A huge reason I bought this is because of the quote inside and the quote is nicely visible.

My slight little dislike is the pockets on the right side, my credit cards do not slide smoothly, it takes a little struggle to put it in and take out. It's still no biggie.",5

716279,"It's so short that the slit goes half way up your rear end. It's more of a tunic shirt length than a dress length, and I have a really short torso. I can't even wear it with leggings because my rear end literally hangs out. I liked the top though. If they made it a shirt or like a foot longer it'd have been perfect.",2

The pink is dark gray not w any taupe or softer worn look of color to it. It is nylon and will not distress. I've tried. If u want it fit like photo buy 3 sizes larger. I bought larger and it was not a comfy oversize as it said in description. I did not see review about material or colors. Cheap for a reason. Oh well.,1

I didn't pick it for the color, but I expect it to be close at least. Also, the card slots are all on the same end of the wallet. As a result, when they are full, it is much thicker at on end than the other. Also, the bands are made of cloth ribbon, not elastic, so there is not much room for expansion.",3

I can't wait to put together outfits and be able to coordinate my earrings to match. Overall for the price, I'd say this was a good purchase.",5
127541,"Pro: This item fit me well (I'm 5'0, 140 pounds), it looks nice from far away. I got lots of compliments
Con: it's so cheaply made, it's comical. Don't look at it any closer than 5 feet away. You can't breathe in the helmet..therefore you cannot even wear it longer than a few minutes.
Would I buy it again? no",3

I didn't realize this was a vinyl sticker on a metal backing when I bought it and assumed it was printed directly onto the plate.

I mentioned this to the seller and to their credit they offered to take it back without question.

I decided to try it out and it seems to be holding up just fine.

Overall quality is ok.",4

108695,"I actually purchased this t-shirt as an x-mas gift for my uncle.  Not only was he completely enthused by my gift idea, but the t-shirt fits him perfectly.  After 1 wash on a hot cycle, the shirt didn't shrink and is officially a new essential part of his wardrobe :0)",5
311216,"I LOVE this nose ring. It fits really snugly and it's super sturdy. Some people mentioned having issues getting it off. It can be a little difficult and I just used hemostats (or roach clips as some call them) to grip the bar and pull it out. So that was no issue for me. But I much prefer the piece being sturdy instead of falling out everytime I move my head. I get so many compliments on this ring, I would repuchase in a heartbeat.",5
115221,"I absolutely love my new ring! It's exactly what I was hoping for, titanium, princess cut ring that won't tarnish. I give it a 5 out of 5, hands down. I ordered a size 6 because they don't have half sizes and I think my finger size is really a 5.5. It doesn't fall off, it fits nice and snug. I work at a restaurant where I always get hit on so I thought this might help, wearing it on my ring finger, it looks pretty real to me and it keeps the creepers away. :)",5
757721,I had looked for years to find a shirt like this for my husband. He not only enjoys wearing them hunting but for everyday on the farm. The shirts are well made and fits as expected. I'll know where to go when I need to buy more.  The price was very reasonable as well! Thank you for a great product!,5

Great support for my back and it did help in flattening my belly but it was very uncomfortable. The band kept rising up and hurting my rib cage. I have big hips and i was constantly adjusting the band because it was riding up and bunching in my back. If your short, like me, you might consider buying the BFF.",3

The comfort-fit interior makes it go on easily.  Highly recommended!",5

My granddaughter is 9 months old, but in the 90th percentile for height. I ordered an 18 month size and it fits perfect. She should be able to wear it the entire summer.",5
223317,"Received this hat quicker than expected. Super adorable! Fit my small 18 month daughter well with plenty of room to grow. It isn't fully lined with fleece, which was fine with me (my daughter's head runs warm). The fleece is very soft. The pom-poms were super cute, however my daughter pulled them off with one tug. Won't be hard to get a needle and thread and re-attach them, however, I plan to just leave them off. For the price, no complaints here! Can't go wrong with this hat.",4

I've had other beads that were the same size in their own color, but there was a noticeable size difference in other colors. The end result didn't look very nice due to the various sizes. These are going to be so easy to work with for a more professional result. I will definitely purchase more in the future.",5

The style and shoulder design was nice, but the material and color looked weird on me, perhaps too bright.  If you're really interested in it I would prefer the black one instead.  Yes, I wore a belt, but without the belt made me look extra big...like a big pink bubble gum.",2

All in all, I recommend this.  It would make a nice gift for a new mother, symbolizing the use of cloth diapers with diaper pins.  I think a teen would enjoy it, as well.",5

434653,"I love this ring for my oldest daughter for Christmas but have to say that compared to other silver jewelry, it is overpriced. I am an avid shopper of a variety of jewelry especially with gemstones and felt that for the weight of this ring, craftsmanship, and lack of gemstones, they charged too much. I will probably not be buying anything else from this company.",5

Having whined about that, I do understand it is a grab bag when it comes to natural stones and I would definitely order this ring again to see what the next stone looks like.  The setting is very solid and the size of the stone very nice since I like a strong rectangle or oval shape.  The price is unbelievable for the size and quality of this ring.",4

My wife has bigger nipples that are usually perky anyways but squeezing these onto them keeps them hard for as long as they're on.

The sleeves were too tiny. Also, the army green color was a rich dark blue. Pretty, but not army green. I thought I had received the black by accident, at first. It is described as made of 'cotton blending,' but it feels like polyester.",1

712218,These are pretty inflexible and hard to put on. They are misshapen now from me trying to bend them so I can close them.  The closure is way too small so you have to really work at closing them. My ears are too sore from trying. I've given up and ordered a different pair. Would not recommend.,1

I open it & the label says xl so I think I'm ok. Then I put it on. Well, I start to put my arm in... My wrists are very tiny & they were snug... So I don't know if this jacket was mark wrong or if the bag was marked wrong but it wasn't a normal xl.
And like others have said... the zipper was fried.
Its going back.",1

651663,Dress was exactly what I had been looking for. Great tshirt fabric and NOT see through! That was a major win as every other dress I had been looking for was very cheaply made.  I generally wear a size 8-10 and got an XL.  Fits great with a little room to shrink.  Thinking about buying more colors!,4
306199,I really like these but the stitching is starting to come a little loose and I'm left wondering how long they will last.  They are somewhat sheer (not legging sheer but they get somewhat translucent on the knees when I bend down).  I would buy these again though; they fit perfectly and I love the piping pattern down the leg.,4
293608,"I've worn a few jeggings and the material is too thin to even be leggings.  Aesthetically ok but EXTREMELY unflattering.  It's not thick or tight enough to provide any help in the body shape control area.  It provides less support than stockings.  Works ok with a girdle or shape wear, but that defeats the purpose of wearing jeggings for the comfort of leggings.",3
768869,"I really like these eyeglass cases. I own one that is many years old and wanted another one. I only use it for one pair of glasses. Not sure it would hold two pair but it suits my needs. I use the extra compartment for a little cash and a lens cleaning cloth. It is soft and not bulky like hard cases, so fits well in small-ish handbag.  Washable which is good and love the pattern.",5
75839,"I was worried that it wouldn't hold up my pants as securely as I thought it would, but after trying it on, I'm a believer!
The rubber band around the bottom part makes it very secure. I moved about in it the whole day and it stayed put.
It's so comfortable and worth the purchase! I'm so happy I can wear all my jeans and pants!
Considering buying the white one now.",5

635365,"It was way too small, especially below the hips. There is no room to walk in it, unless you're trying to walk like Morticia Adams. It's a cute dress, though. I like how the top part fits. This dress is recommended for women who have flat bellies, narrow hips, and skinny legs.",1

Wishing I had ordered an XL now.. it definitely lifted but it was INCREDIBLY tight and I can't wear the medium. Definitely order at least 3 sizes higher than you normally wear. This sizing is a joke.,1

So it lacks on the quality side a bit",3
207568,This is really gorgeous and I love it. Only complaint is one of the chain loops holding it to the actual pendant was loose and made pendant slip off. It was an easy fix though. Just take a pair of pliers and tighten the chain opening. Overall I'm very satisfied and I love it,5
35642,"I bought 3 six packs Love these. I have them everywhere around the house, in the cars, in my bags. Quality is fine for the price and they last a good long time. One tip - get a tiny glasses screwdriver and keep it handy to tighten the screws on the glasses on a regular basis.",5
626568,I really like this shirt.  I wear a M/L and bought a L.  I need to have correct posture and suck in the tummy for it to look good.  Then it looks really good.  Great workmanship and fabric. I'm it will fit in a month due to weight loss program.  Will be great for next spring.,5

There are so many colours and type to choose other than the ones you would like to buy. I bought plenty of other straps from clockwork before,and i am very satisfied so far. Will update about the condition of the loop rings if available,because i was disappointed with the other brand's durability of the loop rings, They tend to rust,so hopefully this will not...",5
452264,Loved this top!! It fit perfect and was just the right amount of sexiness. I was able to dress it up for my night out with the girls and then also put on a long sleeve shirt under it to match my spider man son when we went trick or treating. Fit nice and tight on my waist and covered my chest perfectly. Would definitely recommend this costume and attached photos for examples as well.,5
817486,Cute shirt thought it would be a little bit closer to size so I would recommend ordering your exact size or a size smaller I am usually a small and ordered a medium so that it would be a little loose and it fits me like a large besides that this is a cute shirt with any outfit,5
84977,"This is a fun dress for the evening. Is it the most well made & finest of material? No... BUT it is excellent for the price. Material feels good (not too cheap). The one thing that might be bothersome to some is that the ""adjustable"" neck is two zippers than gives things a distinctive look, but might irritate people's shoulders and/or neck.",5

The only thing is that I ordered 2 packages and was wishing I could select that I wanted them to be different colors so I got 2 of the same color pattern.  I would like to order more but would like to be able to select the colors.",5
91704,"The fit is good except for the attached panty. The panty was snug, but I wear and one piece and do not the the panty part.

I received it fairly quick (about3-4 days after I placed the order).I have had it now for a little bit over 6 months and I love it! I don't usually wear in water or anything of that nature. It is as ""bright and shiny"" like it was when it was brand new but it hasn't turned my finger green nor has it tarnish like most silver does. Really good ring for the price.",5
202172,Adorable! So bursting with color! I am officially only buying from Amazon. From forever 21 and even Francesca's they're 4 times more (not at forever 21) and break.

615652,"Finally opened package, here's my honest opinion: love the Halloween type of color! It's alot smaller than I thought, but still completely wearable. It's not as fluffy or heavy material wise but for the price, one cannot complain. I'd like to parade this scarf around town. Ya know, test it out before reviewing, but w triple digit weather...hmm,  not happening. I'll have to update this review, when cooler weather allows me to do so. Happy w purchase!",3
404556,I bought this chain for my wife on Mother's day so she would have a better chain to wear her two tone locket-pendant that I had gotten previously. It's a nice thick silver-gold chain that looks great compared to the ultra thin chain that came with the locket. She was very pleased with it needless to say. Highly recommended!,5
79859,The dress fits like a dream - hugs the right curves & hides the wrong ones!  It comes in many different colors/patterns - I will be buying more than one of these.  Straps wide enough to hide bra straps & back high enough to hide the bra clasp.  FABULOUS DRESS!!,5

Turns out, these would probably look awesome on anyone. Perfect size for any face, came in great packaging with a nice Ray Ban case for them that is super protective. When I'm not wearing them they are in the case somewhere at the bottom of my purse, and the case always keeps them safe! Definitely reccommend.",5
418267,This ring is so cute. Perfect for the Holiday season and such a conversation starter. This is my second one I've owned. The first one lost it's liquid after a year or so but I loved it so much I bought a new one. The other reviews said that their drained rather quickly so I just put a dab of super glue in the hole around the plug and it's been fine. It was also delivered on a day that an unexpected snow fall happened and no problems although I wouldn't recommend putting it in the freezer.,5

Nice zippered pocket for light weight articles.  Appears well-sewn.  Would like a bit longer leg--personal preference - they are long enough but I like just a bit more.",5
165137,I'm a size small in bottoms and these were too tight. Have to return for bigger size. Order a size up. The previous reviews I read had mixed information on sizing. If you have a butt then order a size up. Period. Other then that they are cute and good quality.,3
678437,"Contacted the seller and they exchanged the suit for the next size up.  The suit is the perfect length and the material is good quality.  However, we bought these last year too and they do begin to wear-out by the end of summer.  Plan on a one season purchase which works for us cause kids grow so quick anyways!",5

There is a small silicone strip that really does a great job of holding my pants up! They are already fully open in order to be comfortable at this point, and I haven't had any issues. This does well in the wash and the black looks like another layer under my shirt. I will probably order the other colors as well.",5

I'm shopping for more colors and pattern to jazz up my ensembles.",4

403083,"I love all the shirts from this company and really like this one. True to size and made of good quality... however, when ordering, all the pictures of the shirts appear the same (red)... I wasn't paying attention and ordered a grey shirt instead of a red one, which is what I wanted. I'm not a big stickler so I kept the shirt I got... but when ordering, if the color of the shirt is important, make sure you get the right one.",4
408533,"These T. Shirts are a great buy.  They always keep their shape and color after washing it and drying it.  They are very good to wear them all year round. They run up to their sizes.  One thing I like about these t. shirts is that they are comfortable around the neck, you don't have to strech them like other ones.  I can only tell you that if you buy them you will never regret it.

It was a little large on him and he's not a small child (he's in the 96th percentile for height and 75th for weight). But the good news is, he wasn't sunburned and he didn't blind himself. I'd call it a win. Plus, he will be able to use it longer than I anticipated. It was good quality and we will most likely be able to pass it down to his brothers or sisters.",4
636137,"I purchased this item to keep me warm while reading in bed at night. My husband usually likes our room to be cold in order for him to sleep, so I usually freeze when sitting up in bed. This bed jacket keeps me warm and comfortable. I can now enjoy reading in bed without freezing. Great product that I would recommend and buy again.",5
610486,Weight 150/height 5'1....I ordered a size small and it fits fine. It's a very fitted dress and it shows your curves (I'm very curvey btw). I did receive this order 8 days after I ordered it. Also I will go on to say that I thought I was purchasing an actual tie dye dress but it's just a white dress with print on it. I should of read the fine print.,3
370513,"I have yet to decide if I trust that these are actually plated with real silver. They feel like plastic to the touch. I sized on my fingers where I wanted them to fit before purchasing. I sized the rings when I realized that they only fit on one finger where I wanted them to go. They are not a 4. They are all a 3. Very annoying. Even if they were the correct size, they would not be worth the price at all. Only positive is I got them quickly.",1
697426,I saw everyone's reviews and went a size larger than I normally am and the medium bottoms do not fit me still. But the material is nice and it looks just like the picture shown. So I'm satisfied about everything but the size of the bottoms. :) ps. I'm like a size 2.,2
44554,"when i first got these shoes they were really cute but part of the inside of the shoes were actually silver. I didn't think that mattered but i got these at a size 6 since they were on sale. My toes felt they were clamped shut on eachother and around my ankles were a bit loose. Nonetheless, these were really cute and i may even wear them to a wedding. The frills were a nice addition =)",4
672931,"I am a 34 DDD and it is too tight. I was hoping with them saying it was 38 inches it would work. Not. As said there are no tags into which I really don't like. I sew so I am going to work with the flap that goes underneath, there is extra fabric that should be secured to the inside but is not so I am going to use it to alter it or I will use the shirt as a very expensive pattern and remake one to fit me.  I would not buy another one.",3
54022,"I was very excited to get this hat based on the stellar reviews.  I liked the idea of the wide brim and tying chin strap.  Unfortunately, the brim was SO FLOPPY that my 16 month old could not see--it fell down on all sides and covered his eyes.  I ended up returning it for nearly the cost of the hat. Searching for something else, now.",2
511725,"On January 30, 2015 I ordered a XXL suit in Red, and a XL suit in Black and it fit, but one side of the Black suit's underwire was sticking out and I had to sew it back inside. Typically I am size Large, but ordered up.
The red suit Return is still being processed! With a 2 Year wait to get my original payment form credited..
The material feels like a wet suit, it is a fair price the suit will only last one season if you plan on swimming in it.",3
448232,"This is my daughter's second pair of squeaky shoes, but the first from this brand. I'll gladly repurchase these when she outgrows them because they are so comfortable on her and seem well-made. They also appear to be fairly easy to spot clean, when necessary. Please note that other reviewers are correct about the sizing. My daughter is about a size 6 US and I purchased these in a size 8 and they have room to grow without being unwieldy on her. Thanks to all the previous reviewers who led me to this item!",5
342812,"Very nice bag! I got the bunny/cake one and is just as described. I wanted a small cross body bag that could hold my instax mini 8 and some film, this bag was perfect for it, it even holds extra stuff since it has 2 compartments inside and an extra spot outside too. Very nice quality.",5
469933,"I would definitely recommend this product. The bottoms fit great and are very comfortable. Of course you get what you pay for meaning its not the most extravagant material, but its definitely worth the buy. It got here much quicker than expected as well. I would not hesitate to buy another product from Sheridyn Swim.",5

I  think is bette to  know  the diference",5
831752,"Everything fit, but after one day of wearing them, a light on each shoe has a glitch and is a different color from what its set on. It blinks different colors and doesnt match the rest of the shoe. The first day, it didn't do that. this happened with both pairs i ordered!",2
793845,"a fine watch, very accurate, looks great, easy to set and synchronize (commando-style)  with other watches, chrono function is accessible and works well....would be five stars if not for the water vulnerability.  after a shower, there was visible moisture between the layers of the crystal; no moisture inside the works, just a fog on the crystal, which took several days to dissipate.  all indicators can be adjusted, dial luminescence is rather low after ambient light...

this is now my everyday watch, but I won't get it wet beyond handwashing....",4
85204,The hat works as expected. Purchased for work environment. My son installs solar panels in Hawaii and is constantly in the blazing sun. The hat helps protect his neck and face and stays on even on windy days. He is very pleased with the purchase and plans to buy another as a back up.,5
90654,"I bought this because I am still a little self conscious about my tummy after having a baby. I am 5""0, and 129lbs..(so still a bit over weight, in my opinion)..I bought a medium, and it's baggy..It's pretty cute other than that, I think the ruffles are a bit larger than the picture and being a short gal they kind of take over my body, but still wearable!",3
363284,"I buy this brand for all
My grandkids. They do fit large so don't buy next size up or they be way too big. My boys wear 2t and they are large but stay up but hopefully they get 2 or 3 years of wear and high quality can pass down to baby boy.  So soft and so cute and search everyday can find a design for really cheap.",5
874162,"After some of the reviews, I was nervous that they might be yellow or have an inclusion.  I got the 1 carat total weight (1/2 c each earring).  When I opened them, I could not have been happier.  My wife loves them and is super happy.  I could not tell the difference between these and any better color diamonds I looked at in person.  I am not a giant review writer, but I thought this definitely warranted a very positive one.",5
102933,I was happy to find a youth size Dr. Who T-shirt for my son. I picked a size 8/10 because that is the size of all of his shirts. I was disappointed that it barely fit him. These run very small. Luckily I was able to return it and re-purchase the larger size.,3
603049,A good band for the price. I put it on my Timex Weekender and it adds a classy flair. I got the other two colors as well and can change them out depending on what I'm wearing. I've probably worn it for around 2 months and it hasn't shown very much wear. It came a little long so I trimmed it with a sharp pair of scissors. The end that I cut hasn't frayed. Definitely worth the money.,5
550164,This top was double the size of another top I bought the same size...  Quite unexpected.  And since I had to pay shipping on it...  sending it back was not my first choice.  I did find someone to give it to....  But it wasn't just too large but it was humongously large.,1
14244,These are decent for the price.  The arch could be a bit higher for me but overall they do the trick.  I like how they absorb impact and that they fit the entire shoe.  No moving around under your foot and no need to pull your shoe off an readjust.throughout the day like those other supports.  I recommend them.,4
582901,"Objectivily, item is comfortable, a little see thru, but prints help a lot, from far print looks clear, I expected that it was going to be more defined, is more on the blurry side, but it does the trick in showing the star wars robots clearly.
From personal perspective I'm not sure what possessed me to buy an star wars legging, I like the series but I'm not that much crazy about it, or have such trendy style for my wardrobe. I guess seeing how nice it looked on the model made me think I could pull it off too.",3
377415,"got these for my fiance for his birthday! he loves them! says they are the most comfortable pants he owns and has requested more. def follow suggested sizes was right on spot. color was toned true to the picture too. He is a little tall (6'2"") and the pants were just the right length with shoes on",5
692057,Lovely & looks exactly like the photo! I wish I had ordered a size up but it still works out. I'm normally a US size medium (36 bust) I ordered a size 12 and I can close it around myself but I would rather have a size bigger since I wanted this too be big and roomy. If I had ordered a size down from the 12 it would be too small & I wouldn't be able to wear it! So if in doubt I would say size up.,4
495756,"I was expecting a 'nice belt'. Turned out to be a 'great belt'. I love it. Looks great and easy to put on and take off. I did have trouble taking it off at first and took a quick look at the paper that came with it so I could find where the latch was. Glad I got the belt, will probably get a couple more designs.",5
523754,"Ladys,
Listen.
These glasses are 5 freaking dollars. And CUTE. Yes. It takes over a month to get here. Yes the flowers are screwed on and you have to help them out every so often to make sure they are screwed in. But. That is it. They are FREAKING cute, I got alot of compliments on them, even a waitress looked them up and bought them as she was taking my order while I was wearing them. For $5 its a steal and get them in both brown and black so you can match your outfit as fitting.",5
408853,"I was really pleased with this necklace and pendant set.  It's smaller than I thought, but I quickly got over that when I saw it on all my bridesmaids.  I bought them matching earrings and I don't think I could have found anything better as a gift for them.  So classic, they can wear them with just about anything.  I'm a VERY happy customer.",5
207834,"I love this hat!! It looks great on. The color is great also. I understand why some people said it looked kinda beret style, because when you put it on it's kinda boxy in the back. I am very happy with this hat and not to mention the price of it!! Two thumbs up!!",5
751026,It is super cute and I love the design and quality is not bad but it runs really small. If you buy a 4T of this product it will fit like a 2T from a regular kids clothes store - so beware. You can buy your new born - 3 months old baby and wait for them to fit the size you bought here if you know what I am saying.,3
814837,"So far so good. They fit great for me, but expect a snug fit. I ordered a small and 5'4"" 117lbs with slim hips.  Fabric is soft, opaque enough and the design is unique and sophisticated. I love the grey and pink - both true in color. I can't speak for the wear and performance yet but expecting for the price they will do well.",5
517530,"This little bag is perfect! I love the fact that it has a removable shoulder chain and another chain to carry the bag. Colour is perfect and the peacock feather adds to the charm of the bag. Just enough room for my phone, lipstick and glasses. Doesn't look inexpensive that's for sure. Got many compliments! The added bonus is the clasp on the top of the bag. You can hold with the closure ring ! Great for standing around having cocktails! Looks like a beautiful cocktail ring! Love this little bag!",5
117665,"Awesome kilt, get some goofy looks from people but seeing as I wear it to the shooting range I work at and people think twice about screwing with a 6'1"" long beard and long haired Scotsman (with a .44mag on my hip).  Fits well, do wish the pockets were a tad bigger but still functional.  All around awesome!",5
124889,"I needed these glasses for my trip to Mexico. I was in need of something cute and hip for my little get away and these glasses did just that. The folding of the arms was a little stiff, but it doesn't change a thing and I would absolutely buy these particular glasses in the other fun colors that they come in. I have Turks and Caicos in April! :) For $5 they are definitely worth it.",5
514053,I ordered based on the way they described sizing and on the way my last swimsuit that was sized that way fit. I ordered 2xxl last time but my 34Gs were spilling out and the bottoms were tight around the leg. So I ordered 3XXXL this time. The 3xxxl fits great in the bust but is loose on my size 10 waist. I knew I wouldn't get a perfect fit and the rushing masks the looseness.  So I'm happy.  I hope this helps others with sizing.,5
232726,"This is my third one in as many years.  They work great and are wicked slim.  The elasticity of the band does tend to degrade quite a bit (for me) after 10-12 months of use, and the rubberized strip inside the band fails quickly, these are pretty short money for a seriously minimalist wallet.",4
515919,"Just a tad loose at the waist, but it's because I've been losing weight. I'm 5 ft 1in and a pear shape. This set fits more comfortably than the M a bit, but I wonder how it will do when wet? I'm anticipating that if I gain weight back then I have a swim suit to fall back on. The pattern is cute and I love how it looks! The bra has support and I don't need the pads. The bottom are thin, but for the price, it will work for my activities!",4
772721,"I wore this the first time to get my denture appointment and I hate dentists, so, my appointment was the best dentist and I looked super cute as well... I wore this dress with my 10yr old Ariat Boots that hit me at my knee cap... sexy if I do say so myself!",5
613205,"Very poorly made. The construction on each sleeve was clearly different, and one of the buttons fell off before I could even try it on. One of the answered questions about this shirt states that it isn't see through, but it is absolutely see through. You couldn't get away with wearing this without a tank underneath. Also, many reviews said to order a size larger than normal, but I did that, and it was too big. I returned this shirt for a refund. Will not purchase clothing made in China in the future.",1
559279,Its a bit short but is super stretchy (im 5'7'' with long legs and torso). Its made of a lycra/swimsuit like fabric that is soft and flowy if somewhat of meh quality. (I've bought other similar garments and don't mind it but if you are looking for a cotton/rayon blend this is not for you) No itchy tag which is a plus and a minus as I'm unsure how to wash it (hand wash most likely). Overall I really love it but it's really not for nitpicky fans and you get what you pay for.,5
413448,"I gifted the pajamas to my brother for Christmas but the XL was apparently way too big so he returned them and I sent him same pajamas but in size M and he said they fit and he likes them slot, they are comfortable and the dog print is great.",5
294021,I hated these. I thought I had bought the right size and they seemed to fit well. That was until I started moving around. I wore this under a dress and I spent the whole time pulling them back up. They stretched out super fast and I couldn't get them to stay up.,1
572319,"Do not buy! Shirts didn't come from MerchDirect, they came from a different company from China. Plus horrible shirt material the image is like a stick on and a no brand shirt. You can tell its not a band shirt Just all wrong not a normal band tee at all really annoyed.",1
59901,"These are the BEST house socks ever. I have wood floors which can be slippery. So the little rubber dots on the bottom of the socks are perfect for traction. The elastic at the top isn't too tight either. They are soft, lightweight and feel good. I wear them as soon as I get home!",5
203715,"I really like this for my son:  we use it as cotton long underwear under his winter clothes.  Wearing this, his ankles and feet are covered and I don't have to worry about him pulling his socks off or having bare cold ankles on a cold winter day.",5
422839,"Just got this in the mail and as soon as I unwrapped it I noticed that it's a very similar watch stand, but not the one in the picture (so buyer beware).
second, yeah..it's very very cheaply made but what do you expect from an $8 purchase?
Guess it does the job.",3
242241,I love the look of this ring.  We purchased it as a replacement for my husband's gold band after it got a little too snug for his finger.  The ring is much more comfortable for his finger and I like the look of it better than the gold.,5
600432,"My son is addicted to anything associated with Paw Patrol. He LOVES this shirt. I bought it in March for his 2nd birthday and he can still wear it now. He is a big boy so I bought a 3t. It ran large, closer to a 4t but that was fantastic. He can wear it for even longer. Great quality.",5
416340,"I bought two of these as gifts for little girls turning one year old. They are very sweet, about the size of a dime...maybe a bit smaller. Perfect for a child or young girl. The chain is very thin, and could break easily. The parents of both girls were very pleased with them.",4
751499,"The color and shimmer are really nice but the crotch seams are weird. They have two seams in front and back that make it awkward if you are wearing a top that doesn't cover your butt. I'm a bigger lady, 5'5"" and 154 lbs. They were a little too tight on me.",4
506612,"I'm 5'11, 155lbs and I ordered a large based on the reviews saying these were super small, I normally wear 8-10 or M. These fit great.  Long enough for me, obvi I'm tall, and they actually do have stretch to them, so they're loose at the end of the day. Material is lightweight, I think if I tugged on them too hard they might bust some seems, but hopefully they stick around for awhile. Very cute.",4
451582,"I would not recommend this product for anyone who wants something that actually slims. It might be good to wear underneath things to smooth, but slim it does not, and that's what I bought it for. The fabric is so thin, it didn't do the job at all. I tried it on when it arrived, and returned it immediately to the packaging to requested a refund. They should probably rename it to be a ""Smoother"", not a ""Slimmer"".",1
647545,As everyone has said if your tall.. Don't order!!.  The material is nice. The pattern is nice.  I got a large but but I'm 5'7 and it's not long enough. Talk about a camel toe. It's great if your probably under 5'4.  But anyone who is tall doesn't matter the size.  It's not long enough at all.  So it makes it for funny.  Stinks because they are cute.,3
88128,"I received my ear wrap so quickly, within 3 days. And it came in a pretty bag and box. To my surprise there was another pair of earrings - I almost thought the wrong item was shipped. Wow!! My ear wrap fit great and I love the free gift. I'm definitely going to buy more... :)",5
95971,"Skirt is rediculously short. No where near the fit of the picture and quality is about what you would expect for Halloween costumes. Wife is 5'5"" and 135lbs. Skirt was for a 4'5"" person that was about 3' wide. Had to pin the skirt for it fit without falling down.",2
372388,"I have a hard time ordering pjs online so I appreciate reviews about fitting. I usually need to order up a size but I ordered a 3t for my almost 3 yr old, 35 lb son and these fit great. They would have some room for growth too. Pjs are comfy and fun designs. Ordering another design tonight.",4
549085,"I too like Kristen was very disappointed in this purchase. It looks great on the model, but when I tried it on it looked like I was wearing a child size shirt. Way too small. I ordered the xl, and according to the sizing chart it should have fit great. Way too cropped. Barely fit below my chest. It also had a funky smell. No paperwork or tags included in package. The shipping was faster than expected (2 wks earlier than specified). That I was happy about. Requesting a full refund.",1
840948,I didn't even know what this was when it arrived and I took it from the packaging. Very very very ill fiiting garment. Just a huge piece of white material almost like a make it yourself item. I just trashed it. The price was reasonable enough to not make a stink about it. Horrible buy...,1
155621,"The outer case is great. It looks good and the opening mechanism is easy to use. I'm concerned about the inner dividers. I've had that type of divider before, and it cracked very early after just a few months of use. So I'm a bit concerned this will be the same. We'll see.",4
102873,The seams in the back for the pleats were not even and it was noticeable. The seller was great. I had to pay for my return shipping and it wasn't a problem. I don't boy all through Prime- But 98% I do- I feel your more protected through the merchants. Thanks Amazon!,2
95430,At first i wasn't sure about getting this because of the other reviews. But let me just say my expections were blown it fit right it looked awesome and the material was soft and pretty durable so i give this 5 stars and recomend it to anyone who loves naruto or just want to be a badass ninja.,5
749535,"My daughter received this shirt as a gift. The image is very nice. But the fabric of the shirt is super thin. Nearly see-through in parts. It's a nice shirt if it holds up, but I'm not convinced it will hold up for long. This will be washed on a delicate cycle for sure.",3
203639,"Very pretty earrings.  I bought these because I love angels.  However, no matter how hard you try, these will NOT stay in your ears.  They constantly fall out or dangle by the bottom.  The top portion will not stay connected to your ear.  I've already lost one.  Don't waste your money.  :-(",2
692024,"Runs small, but appears that this jacket is more well made than most of the stuff you get from overseas...  it is lined with a havy duty front snap closure, material is kind of a rayon/sati type, leather should not be in its' description whatsoever, as it is NOT leather, not is it leather like, either.  For the price, it was NOT what I expected.  I may either return or give it to someone who can wear it...  not worth the money or the time it took to get it!",3
491615,"Beautiful necklace, but it came as is it was used (even though I bought it new). Did not come in its box (like the other one of the same I bought) and the green stone looked a little scratch. It was a Christmas present for my mom and she didn't want me to return it.",3
261667,"The brown color is rich and warm, the cut is loose but flattering, and the fabric is very soft.  I would highly recommend this shirt.  Tempted to get one in every color.  The sizing is as expected: I'm 5'7"", 135lbs and the medium fits very comfortably.  If you like your shirts tighter, you might even be able to comfortably wear a small.",5
407107,"At first I was daunted by the size of the wallet, but WOW!! It really does organize my stuff!!  I like that I am able to remove it from my purse to carry into a store and 'lighten my load', if you will.

Real leather- nice construction.

I'm happy with this item.",5
141440,The zipper part broke a few days after I got it but still closes. I can put a folder in this purse and all of my makeup and items. I am a mom and call it my Mary Poppins purse. You would be shocked how much you can fit in it. Black magic.,5
39845,"I'm a 34G, so I'm always impressed when a sports bra fits appropriately (as compared to all of the ones in the store).  That said, though, this ""sport bra"" did absolutely nothing sporty.  Even walking around, there was jiggle.  I have a better time in my normal bras than I did this one and returned it right away.
Shock Absorber Women's Extreme Support Sports Bra is the bra that I found for my size that actually holds the girls in place.",2
428414,"These are pretty basic, they have a good fit and feel. Best of all their cheap and if you break them you can afford more. I love these in the sun though, the polarized lens def do their jobs!.

Updated to five stars because I've had these alil over two years now and they have been durable as far my everyday cheaps.",5

812746,"Not sure who's writing these reviews, but I'm very disappointed with this belt. Cheap, thin flimsy. The pattern looks stamped by machine rather than hand tooled. The texture is more like plastic than leather. I'm a skinny guy who wears Levis and belts like this daily. Some of my belts are more than 20 years old, and my favs have the wear to show for it. This belt would be unlikely to last me a year.",1
758640,"Very large and I have a large head.  I ended up cutting off the flower, flipping up the rim and sewing it in place and reattaching the flower.  Once I did those things the fit was perfect but otherwise the cap entirely covered my eyes.  I don't like the ""slouchy"" look at all.",3
214701,Beautiful vest! My husband loves it and the colors match perfectly. He will be wearing to the daddy/daughter dance to match our girl's red and purple dresses!

I would recommend this unit to all.",5
305602,"This is a complete kit with everything you'll need to do a piercing (minus the marking pen). I just did a navel piercing that turned out beautifully. The needle was strong enough and sharp enough to go through smoothly. The only miscalculation either from the needle or operator's error (lol) was, I thought the needle was also a guide in which as you pull out the needle, the jewery was threaded or at least fit inside  the needle for an easy pull through and then detach.  Either way it worked wonderfully. :)",4

It was extremely tight in the chest on me, however, I have G cups, so I wasn't surprised by that. It was slightly uncomfortable, but not enough to deter me from wearing it for a night out. I'm 5'10"" and it fell below my knees. Very beautiful!",4

Two hours later I found them in a store at half the price and tried to cancel my order. It wouldn't allow me and still didn't ship for over another day. When I received them, they weren't the same brand as the first and didn't fit the same. I'm very unhappy, and won't be buying again.",1
445085,"I love these pants! I wish I purchased more before they ran out. I first bought a size M (my usual size) which fit a little too tight (I like my cargo a little loose). The size XL, unfortunately, hung a little more loose than I liked, but that's nothing a belt can't fix. A size L would probably have been perfect.",5
41871,"This purse has many pockets, including one that doubles as a wallet. It is almost exactly what I was looking for, but the strap is too long. I would prefer it to hold the purse right at my elbow. When I adjust the length of the strap it turns into two straps, and sometimes they wander off in their own directions when I go to pick it up.  I had my daughter sew them together, but I see no reason why any purse would have a strap that long.",4
146029,"I only just received it but it is everything I hoped it would be!  I bought it for my middle finger and it looks perfect.  This is only my 2nd ring from Amazon Collection but so far very happy with the color and sparkle of all the stones.  If these rings hold up, I can easily see me buying more from Amazon Collection because the prices are very reasonable for costume jewelry and the sparkle is great!",5
645311,The colors aren't what they say they are. I got some sort of purple looking swimsuit when it should have been taupe. One thing I didn't like was that the inner portion of the bikini bottom is white and you can see it at the top of the bikini line. The fit wasn't a problem like all the other reviewers mentioned. My measurements are 34D-26-37.,3
33639,"These were bought because I thought they would keep my legs warmer when walking in cold weather, and they do; they are comfortable, and fit well.  I have long legs for my body and they still go up to the thighs......not as far up as the models, but I never expect that.  I am glad I found them they are warm, and comfortable and wash nicely, but I do wash the socks by hand so they will last a long time....am waiting for the white ones now.",5
554255,This was Christmas gift for my  5 1/2 year old granddaughter. She loved it and put it on right away. By the next day the necklace was broken! Would think that it would have been tested for durability because that's what children do...take it off and put it back on. The set is very pretty and the description was right on.,2
268588,"This is my new favorite dress. I wore on my LA trip, to a wedding and even to work. Very comfortable and flatters my figure. I am 5'4 with 42"" inch hips, 30"" waist. The embroidery on this dress is beautifully done as well. I'm even ordering another one in a different color.",5
614576,"This is a very nice swim suit, it fits very well the bottom is just a tiny bit small but that fine because if I had Horton a large it would have been to big at the top, it's supper attractive I really love it, I'm 5'3 114 pounds with b cup boobs so I got a size M",4
835767,It's a cute dress but the top portion under my arms is way too big and had to be pinned to wear it. The slip underneath is way too short for the dress and doesn't cover my booty so I have to wear leggings or use this ONLY as a beach cover up.,3
572258,"I have these in black, Navy (which is not as described bc it is camo) and tan. Unfortunately the tan run smaller than the other colors and are very snug.  I love the style and they are long which is a plus.  Why the tan is different Idk! Other than that I would buy the other colors again. I bought a medium - I am 5'6 145lbs",4
398095,These earrings are something I will cherish forever.  I feel like I am a different person when I put them on.  Mainly because they are not heavy and because they do not make my ears itch.  Those have been problems I have faced with earrings in the past.,5
426681,"The shield itself is durable and it is the size they describe. However, what is not included in product information is that this item is small, flat, and very poorly crafted. The paint job spills over the sides. The shield itself looks like a base for a very small nightstand table. The only thing similar to the detail of Captain America is the star and rings. However on a flat surface these look quite ridiculous. All in all I believe this product to be a waste of time and money. Unless your looking to build a Captain America themed table.",2
144712,"I ordered these based on the reviews. I was not impressed when I got them though, they come in cheap packaging and look like I could by them from my local beauty supply store, but at what price I am not sure. I hope they work, I will have to replace most of the backs as they are not stuck in the middle, but on the sides. They are rubber/ plastic backs. I hope they work for my daughter.",3
437123,"I'm 5'8"" 130lb and a B cup, I got a small.  I found the bottom half to fit really well but the top half was too big and too long, so I took in the top two bars two inches and skimmed about an inch of the top length. It was somewhat sheer so I wore nude underwear underneath. Be careful using petal pasties, where the petals meet, the fabric bunches so I actually just use those large knee bandages and they worked great.  Otherwise very happy.  Had good coverage.",4
649947,"I really like this dress. The fit is great, it's cute, my partner loves it on me, and it is not too heavy to wear in summer. For the price, it's a worthy purchase. My only complaint is that the red color is not true to the picture. I didn't expect it to be, but I had still hoped for the best. Still, I'd choose to buy it again.",4
330858,"Used these in 15-20 degree weather for 3 days and they worked so well my hands sweat.  The problem is my hands sweat and the inside of the gloves would become soaked.  The only way I could get these dry enough for the next day was to push them inside out.  There needs to be a better way to dry these because, as you know, pushing gloves inside out can be problematic.",4
825553,"I ordered a size 18, which is what I always wear in a bathing suit. The molded cups did not hit the right spot do this did not fit at all. I am returning it. The reason for 2 stars is that it is very pretty. Perhaps it would fit someone with a long torso.",2
65344,Quick shipping. I didn't notice any duplicate rings but they're all cute. The size of the balls are normal. The only downfall is that I didn't get any solid colored one. Most packs have atleast one solid black ring and this one didn't. Other then that I'm totally happy. I'll repurchase from this seller if needed!,5
438049,"Purchased this beautiful jacket for my daughter and it arrived within two days. We were amazed at the beautiful quality and sheer craftsmanship. It is warm, looks beautiful  and appears much more expensive. I highly recommend. We purchased the xs as my daughter is a size 2. Fits perfectly with room for sweater.",5
370712,Super Cute and Super Soft!!  Sometimes I really just don't like to wear Lingerie because it is so uncomfortable but after trying on this halter Lace See Trough Babydoll Backless Sheer Nightdress it is so soft and feels so good up against your skin you will want to keep it on for more then a few minutes. The lace halter just fits over your neck and slips right on. The sizing is just as expected. I ordered a size small and fits perfect. I received this product for free for my honest and unbiased review.,5
185155,"Do not order from this company. First of all it took about 3 weeks to get this dress. It is so cheaply made and clingy. I wear a size 2 and I ordered a medium. Not clingy tight, but clingy cheap. The fabric is so thin!  I usually don't write reviews, but I was trying to return this $13 dress. When I went to UPS to mail it back they told me $70. I guess I will just use it for a dust rag. It is just too cheap to even give it away.",1
319953,"The ""White Jade"" appears nothing like the picture at all. There is no pink tone to my set whatsoever, it seems like they just gave me a pair of white plugs instead. I really like the purple and black ones, but I was most excited for the pink set. I'm very disappointed I was not given what I paid for.",2
520741,"Great shirt, awesome color (works really well with my hazel eyes), fits perfect, etc. BUY IT!
In addition, Custom Fit runs smaller than regular. This is why I bought it. Before buying, know the difference. It will save you the hassle of thinking the shirt is fake, or has factory defects. I've bought many Custom Fit Polos because I knew what I was getting in to. Satisfaction, or lack of has never been an issue.",5
511234,I got one in silver and I liked it and it was really pretty and then I went to try it on and it broke still gave it a try but I just don't like it also because it turned my arm green fast first time wearing it! It was a bummer. Then the seller sent me another one in gold for the inconvenience of the first one but the same thing happened. So I guess it is true you get what you pay for :(,1
350952,"Jacket is extremely small. Ordered a Large for a size Medium person and it fit but sleeves were still too short.  But for the purpose, it worked with pushed up sleeves.  Just be warned that this jacket runs really small.  (Also, it's paper-thin, but since it's just a costume, no big deal there.)",3
355691,"I purchased these two pair of readers in Black and Brown. Though they appeared to be a bit small when I opened them, for reading they are perfect size! I love the sturdy cases that they come with. Because of their small size they easily fit in my pocket discreetly and I always have them with me. Though I purchased these at a discounted price, I would absolutely pay retail price for them. Thank you!",5
131021,"This is a pay for what you get material, similar to forever xxi.  I did a lot of research but with no measurement some large are enormous while others are very tiny. The seller was FAST to respond and super helpful and offered to help me find the right size or discount what I had bought that, due to description, was too big or small.  For the money - if you like something it's worth the risk to go ahead and buy it.  Just read all of the comments that talk about sizing.",3
397586,"Have bought a few of these and the cost is very reasonable vs. the regular Birkenstocks.  Don't seem to notice any difference between the two in terms of comfort, fit and longevity as have owned both types previously.  So, would recommend the Betula's vs. the regular Birkenstocks when the former is available.",5
645516,This bikini is super cute for the price! I wear a size two and bought a size small. Bottoms fit normal. Top was a little big. The cups fit perfectly (I'm between a 32A and 32B) but the band could be a little tighter and there's no way to adjust it. Besides that it's super cute and I love it.,4
482807,"They are huge! I'm a petite girl who was looking for something chic and not eating my head...not enough? (Found some great ones at Athleta) This company CHARGES YOU TO RETURN their product and there is some bull**** in writing IF you enter a code at checkout which I DID NOT DO. I was thinkin' okay, ""ya get what you pay for"" which is why I purchased but not to pay to return them. Jesus, why don't I just stick with my rule of shopping and Nordstrom and remain happy with all purchases.",1
712795,"This was a little bigger than I expected and less firm. I'm about 5'0"" with a relatively short torso and the skirt hits me a little above the knee. The tulle underskirt is scratchy and bunches up, which distracts from the sexy. The corset top is flimsy and doesn't stay in place, there's nothing about the structure that offers support. I'm about a 36F and I can't get it tight enough without making the girls look funky. It's cute, but I wasn't able to use it the way I thought I would.",2
878297,"Perfect for the beach and the wave runner. No sand in the toes, they did NOT feel like flippers and they did not slip off. Many jealous people on the beach asked where I got them. We changed into them when we got to the beach (from the cruise ship) but honestly could/should have worn them as shoes the whole day.",5
566946,"I liked it, even though it ran a little small - UNTIL I saw myself OUTSIDE of the low lighting of my bedroom and saw that it was freakin' SEE THROUGH.  Unmistakably, undeniably SEE THROUGH!!  Victoria's Secret was no longer a secret. :(

If you don't care about your boobs/bra showing - or if that is even what you are into... then rock the shirt.  Those with modesty, steer clear, unless you've thought of a creative way of covering up the girls.",1
404307,"This is a very stylish men's ring.  It looks even better in real life than in photos, the carbon fiber detail is amazing.  The ring is very comfortable and extremely light.

Unfortunately, the resin in which the carbon fiber sits can be scratched or scuffed.  This is a great ring for occasions, but will quickly look tarnished if worn every day.

The seller shipped the ring very quickly and in a very stylish case.  I later ordered a tungsten carbide band to replace this ring and again the service was very speedy.",3
643034,I bought one of these a while ago and liked it so much I bought a second one almost immediately. They fit nicely and are easy to adjust. The ratchet style lets you make small adjustments and it doesn't wear down the leather. The buckles look clean and versatile. I wear them almost every day with both dress and casual clothes. They're still in great shape. Definitely recommended.,5
732859,"The hat looks really nice. I wish I could gift it to the person it was intended for.  The set arrived in a cello bag and stunk up the entire room with its foul odor.  After several weeks of airing out, the set still stinks.  I have to return this and all 3 combo sets I bought from this seller.
The scarf is intentionally twisted but too tight for comfort.  They didn't use enough fabric to fit a small framed female.",1
264224,"I am not a skirt/dress wearing kinda girl, but there are certain times and situations where they are required. I am all about comfort and this is one of the most comfortable skirts I've ever worn. Unfortunately mine came to me with a hole in the seam, but I stitched it up and its good as new.",4
385888,"I have never has this problem before, but the glasses seem a bit too small for my face and they keep sliding down my nose, forcing me to push them back up every 10 seconds (especially if i am eating)

Kind of feel like i wasted my money. They look cool, but won't stay on my face.",2
572421,"I usually wear a size xs or s (31"" bust, 25"" waist).  This top fits me just ever so slightly more loosely than the model, the sleeve cuffs just a little longer, which is about what I expected.  It's a very beautiful, very flattering sweater. not to mention very comfortable.  The lace isn't as delicate as I expected--reminds me more of macrame than lace--which is a plus.  I would nevertheless recommend hand washing and air drying.",5
376835,"This animal style toddler towel is super absorbent and so so cute. My little girl loves when I wrap her up in this after bathtime. It soaks up the water and dries really quickly. I love the cuteness of this towel. My little girl runs around after bathtime like she's flying. It's the cutest thing to watch. It is sewed well. Have had no issues with the stitches coming loose after multiple washes.
 I received this product during a promotion for a discount in exchange for an honest review",5
400068,I purchased this for my 22-year-old niece.  It arrived within a few days of my order and I was both pleased and surprised by the quality of the necklace.  It was not all that expensive and so I expected the quality to be somewhat inferior.  It was actually prettier than the picture and my niece loved it!,5
72445,"This belt looks nice, but I found it very stiff. It says that it is leather, but the backing doesn't seem like leather. Also, mine had a sort of mildew smell to it...maybe it was the leather smell, I don't know. I'm sure others would be pleased with the belt. I just don't like it. I ended up ordering a Wrangler leather belt from Amazon and am very pleased with that purchase.",3
220098,"Sometimes you get what you pay for. This is one of those times. The T.A.R.D.I.S is too big to be ""cute"" and also big enough to show the poor craftsmanship. The chain is an awkward length. And for one reason or another I wasn't expecting there to be a little gem on top, which just seems cheesy. Since this item came from China I won't even bother with returning it. Basically, this is one of those purchases that makes me feel like a jerk.",1
35303,"Nice glasses, Perfect for making sure you have a spare pair, The fit is generic  but the look is good. Price is right and delivery was on time. I will go back and order again when I lose/break these. If you are looking for value priced set of glasses these are the ones for you",4
15065,"Used to use custom, very expensive orthotics. These do a better job, very cost effective, very comfortable. Really can't use them in dressy loafers since they just do not fit, but for athletic shoes, boots, walking shoes these are perfect. You will find yourself just buying more and more pairs for all of your shoes.",5
513215,"I normally wear medium (5-7) or 6 for petite US size but ordered a Large size as I have read a lot of reviews saying the size runs a little small.

The color light green is beautiful as shown in picture and the material is good quality.. Very satisfy. with the purchase, will order different color.",5

595900,well made. too small. order up 2 sizes or more.( 1st time a seller called my cell & left a message asking me to change review. I did not call back. They did credit my purchase. If I knew a 10 year old to give it to it would be great.),2
258234,I bought 3 different sets of boots and jackets for my kids for our trip to Florida. They are so cute and will definitely keep them dry in heavy rainfall. I was worried the jackets wouldn't be the more rain resistant rubber material but they were. My kids loved them and didn't want to take them off! So adorable and well made. Very happy with my purchase! Will definitely buy again in the future.,5
107340,Great to try out and see it you want a nose ring or for a costume. This saved me from actually getting my nose pierced because I looked like a dork. So try this out before you get pierced. Also it was great to make my grandmother think I had a pierced nose and ear. It was fun to see her reaction. These do not pinch and are well made for the price.,4
79349,"I was looking for a breathable cotton christening outfit that wasn't 'shiny' and wouldnt make our baby painfully hot in the summertime.  This was very darling, not too fussy and we got tons of compliments.  Its not a family heirloom, but we were very pleased and our little one looked adorable in it.",5

264892,"I was a little apprehensive of ordering this at such a low price, didn't really think it would be very good quality, but it is actually a really good watch. I ordered it for my son and it was too big (I figured it would be) but it was really easy to take a few links out of and he's worn it since then. He even got it wet a couple times and it's fine, looks really cool too.",5

The battery and wiring is accessible but there is not enough excess wire to pull out of the compartment to reconnect the battery. Even tried needle nose pliers. Needless to say we have a sad four year old. We will be returning these.",1
806704,"These are perfect! They're a great size if you're like me & like them just a little bigger so they don't hug your nose. They met my expectations & on top of that, they were sent in a really cute little drawstring bag. I am notorious for losing nose rings, so I actually already have repurchased these! Loved both sets!",5
850537,"Not bad for the price.  I bought a medium and a large.  The large hung better on me.  I'm 5'6"" and 130 lbs.  I wore this to a hipster evening wedding, and got lots of compliments.  The front hung to loose for me, it was too showy, so I added some fabric tape to keep it together and looked great!",4

It picture and colors are very vibrant and I really am happy about this purchase.",5
626868,"Its a nice shirt but its NOT officially licensed (not from DC). The printing is definitely not the best. Up close you can see the distortion between lines.

It does run slightly big, but I like the loose look.  It is a quality made garment,  no flaws.  I'll be out there grooving in this shirt, my jeans and Birkenstocks!  If you like this kind of look, you'll love this blouse as much as I do.",5
166151,"I purchased the Heather Chocolate after buying a pair of the Heather Charcoal last year that I love. The Chocolate color is nice but the fabric composition, as well as the stretch, is different. I love the Charcoal and they are not see through, but the Chocolate feels like it is going to rip or tear if I move around too much. The Chocolate ones also have a cheaper looking emblem that is metallic silkscreen and not the reflective logo like on the Charcoal pair. 3 stars for good fitting Charcoal and inconsistent sizing and material.",3

727788,"I wish I had heeded the other reviews.  Not anywhere close to fitting. Sleeves too small.  I am only 5'4"" and the garment fell only just a bit below my knees.

64616,These are awesome. Bought these for my 2 year old grandson for when he ready for potty training. The variety of Micky characters is great. The only problem he that he wants to wear them now without a diaper. So. finally convinced him to p them on over his diaper. He also put theater 6 on all his play Mickey characters. It is an incentive for him to think about toilet training. Not sure tough if they would fit after 4-5 years of age.,5

It won't last forever, but matches the also cheap saddlebags I bought.",4
411976,This is the most comfortable hat I've ever had.  It is a very nice hat with a very nice design that can be worn with any style of clothes.  The hat keeps my head warm and it is great for a rainy day.  The best part is that it will keep its original design ever if you sit on it.  For the price this is an amazing find.  I can't wait for a white or gray hat next.  Fast shipping!!!!  JCD.,5

The only complaint that I can thinking is the lack of protection, though to be perfectly honest I've gotten no new cracks since I've started using this phone case.

If you don't drop your phone very often or crack the screen, and if you don't mind a relatively flexible, thin phone case, then this is a good case for you--otherwise, I recommend looking into more heavy-duty cases instead.",4

878099,"Cute dress. Wasn't a huge fan of the fabric, it's a bit thick for the summer, so I have it set aside for when the temperature starts to drop in the fall.

54272,"Was excited to receive the product which looked good and came with a protective pouch. But excitement quickly turned to disappointment after the first wearing of the product. Pressure from the sunglasses caused pain across the bridge of my nose -- major negative.

In direct sunlight, the lenses generate a prism effect which distorts true colors. I would have returned them, but the price for shipping was more than the glasses cost.

Save your money -- I do NOT recommend.",2
606928,This top is pretty nice. I'm a 34D and it fit me well. I got the blue one and it's more of a light blue than the darker color it is in the cover picture. It's also sort of cheap but you get what you pay for. It's cute though.,4

Cons: The frames are definitely too wide for my face, but the real problem is that the sides are a stiff, almost sharp plastic that are angled inward.  They dig into the sides of your head.",2
264088,Absolutely perfect skirt! It's nice and stretchy and it fits as expected and it's so comfortable I love it!  I can wear this as a casual skirt or dress it up.  The only thing is that you do need a slip underneath as this is a bit see-through.,4

I gave it to my son's girlfriend for her birthday because she carries a small over the shoulder purse and I thought she might like not having to struggle to remove her wallet. She loved it and I ended up buying one for another friend too. Great gift that is as practical as it is beautiful. Well made and looks just as pictured.,5

I reallly liked this to  :(
P.S. the red is very red not to burgundy but a nice blue red.",2
839869,"I love these earrings! Super light weight! They don't pull your ear down at all. The reason I gave these 4 stars instead of 5 was when I first got them I had adjust the clasp on both earrings with a butter knife, it was too close together, but  easily fixed. I got these at a discounted price for my honest review.",4
144934,"Beautiful black leather wallet.  It was exactly what I was looking for: thin and carries all my cards/cash.  It won't perform the miracle of taking an inch thick wallet and reducing it down to nearly nothing, but it does carry quite a big and does so in as minimal a package possible and very stylishly.  Definitely recommend.",5
564980,"This jacket is light yet pretty warm in fall weather. Has inside pockets that are useful. The large fits well over 2 light shirts(I'm 5'7"" 170lbs)It is snug without being tight however the arms a little more so. I think it's the jacket design as my arms are not big. The jacket loses a star because the zipper is a little fussy,though it seems to be a decent one that is attached well. Overall a nice jacket I would probably buy again unless the zipper dies",4
637558,"I love this seashell charm and had to buy it again because I misplaced my first one.  It goes well with any of the other sea charms and has just a touch of gold to wear it with silver or gold charms.  I hope you make more shell or sea charms. As with most all NinaQueen Charms, this is a five star charm.",5
838210,"My GU Angqi Vintage Women Totem Chinese Printing Thin Scarf Cape Shawl Wraps Stole Warm arrived very quickly after I made my purchase and was well packaged.

219070,"I love these ear muffs. I had a pair this size I bought on clearance at Payless well they ended up getting lost. I needed a new pair in a hurry so I ordered these in black and luckily they came in within two days even though I didn't even request it. They are great! They are warm, big and easy to store. I ordered them in brown as well since I love them so much.",5
867238,"I bought this to take to Hawaii and the fit, material, and the color were superb.  This was the most inexpensive bathing suit I bought in my lifetime and I took a chance because it was advertised with good graphics.  .  It gets scary for me to buy bathing suits online but I was going on vacation - FUN!  Good Job!  Thank you",5
842100,"I don't write a lot of reviews, but for these glasses I'll make an exception. Not only are they great looking, they're very well built too. I'm rough on glasses so I need something pretty sturdy, and these look to fill the bill. Now add the fact that they are 100% UV rated and BOOM!.... done. I'm already looking to buy a 2nd pair.",5
414331,"I bought this ring for my 21 year old sister for her birthday, and she just opened it today, and she LOVED it!!!! Unlike the other review, I highly recommend this bracelet, my sister thought it was the cutest thing ever!!! This bracelet hipped very quick as well!!! I AM A VERY PLEASED CUSTOMER!!!!!!",5
860171,"I read that it ran really small. That was an understatement. I usually order an XL, I like them to be a little loose. Due to the reviews, I ordered a 3X. It fits my 12 year old who wears an Adult S perfectly! The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it looks cute on her.",2
711153,"Finding footed, soft fleece sleepers for children approaching 24 months is somewhat challenging.  Many are without the attached ""footies"", although the convenience of having them attached is what I was looking for.  This sleeper filled the bill for every one of my expectations.  It is exceedingly soft, sized adequately for a child who is approaching 24 months, and the little skid-proof footies are perfect.  I am completely satisfied with this purchase, and I have already given it to my grandson as a gift.",5
492515,"Am I just a person who ends up with lint everywhere? I don't think so. But this shirt gathered it all in one place. I love love love the color, style, fit, and everything else. But I threw it in the wash and am so bummed about the super clingy fibery lint issue. I wish the fabric had less issues.",3
423441,"Overall this product does what it's suppose to do.  However, they tend to slip down after she runs around the house for awhile; I have to keep pulling them up.  They tend to be more of a hazard if they are slightly too big causing her to fall.  When they're just the right size they work well, but she grew out of the perfect fit really quickly.",4
17510,"I was very apprehensive about ordering these, but I was pleased when they arrived.  yes, they are not real diamonds, and no, they do not look like I spent hundreds of dollars on the bands.  However, they look lovely as guards for my engagement ring (with one to spare).  For the price I'm pleased with them.",4
350107,These are great for work. I am a nurse and on my feet all day. My legs and feet don't feel tired when I wear them. They fit well and I like that there is plenty of room around the toe area even though the rest of the stocking is snug.,5
414343,"This item is covered in a stinky substance that transfers to anything it touches.  I thought I was ordering this item in black; however, it came in a dark brown. The leather is tough and not flexible. I put it in a plastic bag and stuck it in my junk drawer, not to be used.",1
190894,"I was kind of hesitant at first because of the price being so low. Gave it a try, delivery was fast. I must say I am impressed this gets a 5 because not only does it look great on my Akribos watch but it feels good. Installation was easy! I'm pleased with this bracelet band.",5
665032,"When my husband put this on, he said it was a woman's jacket. Obviously it's not, but the zipper pull is on the left.  The price was low, but I will pay at least $20 to have a conventional zipper put on. I thought this jacket was made in the UK. Apparently I was wrong. I  ordered another jacket for him prior to this one, which was made in China, and had to return it because the problem with the zipper was the same.",3
119739,"Overall these swim pants have been a good buy. They did fit a little on the small side. Also, while they do have buttons on one side, which can make it easier putting the pants on, or taking them off, a second set of buttons on the other side would have made them perfect. They definitely keep everything in though, should an accident occur (they have for us, and we didn't even notice, because it all stayed in). We would buy these again.",4
848637,"I had to send it back. This looks like such a cute summer dress and I was looking forward to it but it is too small. I ordered the xxl because I don't like figure hugging but it was the smallest xxl I have ever seem. I knew it would be an issue when I took it out of the tiny bag it came in. The material was awful too, it's my fault that I didn't look to see what it was made of. It's very lightweight, thin and clingy material. Maybe if I were a size 4?",2
528380,"I am in between a large and xl depending on the brand so I played it safe and ordered the xl. Good thing I did because it just fit me properly and I know the large would not have fit at all since it is snug around the tummy.
It was not late arriving but did seem to take a little while since some things come so fast from amazon but when it finally came I had to try it on right away. I absolutely love this top and will be wearing it often.",5
406036,These earrings are colorful and different.  They look like they might have been bought at a marketplace on an exotic vacation.  They are weighty but comfortable to wear and appear to be well made.  I have received several compliments on them.  I am impressed with the quality and reasonable price and have already ordered another pair of earrings from Gem Avenue.,5
118710,"I got a lot of attention in this dress (duh) but I ordered the smaller size and it was way too big. I'm 5-foot-3, 120 lbs, 32DD, and if I had a smaller chest, I would have been swimming in this dress. The sequins poke through the seams and make it uncomfortable and itchy.",2
829869,"The size and materials were good. I tried to exchange it for a larger size and the company wanted me to return it for 60% of what I paid and pay for the shipping, plus I'd have to order another. For the shady customer service, it's a 0-1, but for the product itself. It was nice, so I gave it to my coworker who is slightly smaller than me.",3
730871,This dress is really cute and doesnt look cheap. However I have to return it because theres a ton of orange make up around the collar and it REEKS of perfume. Obviously this particular dress has been returned before and then resold without the company even giving it a glance over. So gross. I received it today and immediately put it back into the packaging without even trying it on. They should be more diligent about their products cleanliness and overall quality.,1
437167,I debated over new flat pedals and shoes or these clipless padals and shoes. I feel I made the best choice. I ride a hardtail and I am always riding over terrain that seems to un-mount my foot from the pedal. So far these clipless pedals and shoes have done the trick! I have a pair of Venzo Road clipless pedals and shoes and I love those... these are the same great quality.,5
161832,"The watch looks great. It has a clear and nice looking dial. Sadly the construction is sketchy. After walking to my car in the rain it was cloudy on the inside, it went away after an hour or so but it still fogged up meaning its not sealed. The band feels cheap like its going to break apart. It also loses time pretty consistently even with constant winding. I have to set it at least once a day. Its a shame because it looks amazing.",3
32515,The tights are not diamond shaped like in the picture nor do they have the 'underwear' part in the picture. They are full fishnet in a weird circle pattern. I am not willing to pay for return shipping to get a few bucks back. Maybe I can find a way to match these with what the costume is supposed to look like,3
177178,"Super cute bow belt! I loved how the bow is sewn onto a harder, bow-silhouette-shaped fabric with a clasp. The waistband fits me, as I usually wear a top size small. It is stretchy, so it will accommodate while sitting down, standing up, and lying down (Although the bow isn't very comfy to lie down on. There aren't many belt buckles that are fun to lie down on.)",5
327216,You won't find a better money clip anywhere! If you are looking to try a new wallet this is definitely the one to try. It is very slim and fits in your pocket with out adding extra bulk and makes you look very classy when you pull it out! This is a money clip everyone needs. It holds all my money and cards with a firm grip. It even holds up to one bill at a time!,5
238361,CROCS are the BEST shoes for any wild toddler. for any kid actually. the only reason I didn't pick all day use is because of the 100 defree weather we have here. the inside a little too hot for them but that's what I chose and these will be great for fresher seasons.,5
166770,"I really like these yoga pants and own several pairs. The color of this one is not what I would call Navy. The color is more of a dull and mutes than navy, more of a grey blue. It's a great color too and I love these so kept them.",4
642456,"This is definitely for smaller chested women. I am a 34D or 36C depending on cut and style. This top offered me NO support. My tank tops from target provide more support than this. It is very soft as others say and if I were an A or B cup I would keep it. I would have to wear another bra underneath it for support and that defeats the purpose of why I bought the top, and I am rather rather averse to just throwing my girls out there to bounce around so I am returning it.",3
840759,"These are super cute earrings. I do wish they would put the earrings into a box so that when you open it, they don't pop out onto the floor. I got these for my 13 year old niece for her bat mitzvah and she loves them. I don't think they are so difficult to put on.

I got these earrings at a discount for an honest review. I would definitely recommend them!",4
214877,"Afraid that this was nothing like I thought it was going to be. The material is flimsy and the fit is quite ""square"". Would not buy again. Similar priced waistcoat by Sean Jean felt much more premium. Can not see myself wearing this. Looks and feels more like a halloween costume material.",1
633914,"Eh. It's okay. It's soft, but thin. Doesn't look like the picture. It's not as jacket-like as the picture and the belt is not nearly as thick, and that's disappointing because to me the big bow in front is what makes it look different. I definitely wouldn't order it again.",3
407329,"My daughter who is 1 1/2 years loves putting her clogs on!  They are nice because they have the back strap which helps keep them on.  My daughter has smaller feet at her age than most, and these fit perfectly!  They have gotten a ton of use this summer.  :)",5
823788,"I bought this for my nephew who is 2 years old.
It fit him perfectly.
The long sleeve shirt has a cute little bunny in the front of the cream color shirt.
The elastic waistband pants are also in a cream color with the bunny pattern all over.
And to top it off it also includes a fitted little beanie hat for those cold days or just for looks.
All together making it perfectly adorable outfit.",5
82197,"I bought these as a gag gift for my best friend who loves anime and manga.  They are just a joke-i would personally not buy them unless its just for fun-if you are looking to use these for a costume i would recommend doing a makeup version because these are just to be super fun, they are not to be taken to seriously-they are just to cute",5
190346,"I really like the style but the material is so cheap. Its very thin...I cant wear this to go anywhere.

I normally wear size 12 so based on the other reviews I ordered a XXL to be safe and it was a little to big but the material is awful anyway so I would not wear it.

DON'T BE FOOLED LIKE ME...NEVER AGAIN",2
406075,"The design of this shirt is awesome, and the quality of the cotton is quite nice too, however this is the smallest size 'Large' I have ever purchased. It fits like a medium or a big size small.

I wish this was in the description.

Other than the size of the shirt, the delivery was on time and no hassle with the vendor at all.",2
98364,"This handbag looked better on the computer screen. It just OK. I thought it would be with more space. The purse straps was more big than de bag.
Totally agree with older comments about the odor. It smelled really bad, Ok that it isn't real leather, but if I had known, I would NOT have gotten it.",3
766298,"For what we spent, the quality and fit was beyond our expectations!!!! We will purchase from this seller again!!! The photo was taken right out of the package so my daughter isn't ready for the formal.  :) We are also adding 7 gross of black rhinestones to it.  It's STUNNING!!!!",5
779679,The sizing is very off when compared to u.s. sizing. The stitching and overall feel the fabric is very nice however they are very tight and only shrink when washing. If they were to fit correctly and follow us sizing they would be 5 stars. Order at least two sizes larger then your normal underwear and they should fit okay. I receive this product in exchange for my honest review provided here. The discount provided for my review in no way reflects my review.,4
98498,"Purse is what I expected as far as looks and size, its also very roomy inside. Color was also a perfect match to photo. It feels sturdy enough that it should last a long while. My only complaint is that it had an unpleasant odor to it and I had to air it out for a day. Even with that I would buy again.",4
107671,"I love this coat and I am not a very large person yet I ordered large and it was to small.  You
would have to be a size 2 to fit the large.  I gave it to my daughter and it fit just snug and she's
a size 2.  It's hard to order clothing on line without being able to try it on.",3
324908,"Very uneven quality. The black one, which is the only one I planned to use, is child-size and too tight for an adult to use. The other two are larger. Very disappointed, as I ordered these to replace the black one from the same set, which I had purchased last year in a retail store.",1
729047,"I ordered the dark green dress. When it arrived it was:
1: Not green but more of a brown color
2: Extremely short. Too short to be worn as a dress and I'm only 5 foot tall
3: A completely different dress than what was shown in the picture. The color is different than the picture as well as the picture has a line down the back and the one I recieved did not.",1
823953,"Cute in theory - but horrible in real life. It is see through... So you've been warned. I was thinking I could just use it as a swim cover up - but the strap broke. Ugh. Plus - this must be made in China, because it is cut small. On a positive note, it's a pretty pattern. ",1
141776,Ahhh I love this bag!!! It doesn't stink!!! Huge plus!  Smaller then I thought but great size! Love it. My husband looked at it and right I spent so much money on it... Hahaha. Honestly great bag. Came sooner its already stuffed. Plus my two year old thinks its a wonderful swinging toy. The strap hasn't broke yet. Surpised. Anyway looks great in navy absolutely ,5
149323,"I like it a lot, but it definitely runs very large! I am 41 weeks pregnant (5'7"" and 173lbs currently - size 4/sm/130lbs prepregnancy and wearing maternity Sm or M). The small fits a bit large on me even being so pregnant! I'm keeping it because it's always nice to have room, but considering this is for nursing and post-pregnancy, I could have gone with an XS.",4
815498,"This is SUPER cute. However, there is a hole in the back of the shirt (not where the tag was). Of course I didn't notice it until after it went in the wash and my son had it on his body. Absolutely adorable, nice fit (the shorts are a little bulky) and the shirt is really nice quality... aside from the hole. :-/  Suggest just doing a thorough check before taking the tags off. Wish I had!",3
589982,"Excellent deal on a pair that is $299 msrp, got them for half off

When I first put them on they fit perfect but as all raw denim expands these needed a belt after about 1-2 days of wear. I wonder if I should have sized down but all things considered nothing a belt couldn't fix as the calf area is already quite tapered. First time ordering jeans on Amazon through East Dane. Happy with purchase",5
290565,"Yes. Perfect for my body shape to wear at an all- white event. 32"" chest, 30"" waist & 40"" hips. I ordered a size small. The white color material calls for the right undergarments. The material is that of a cotton t-shirt & it stretches. I'm coming back to buy other colors & at this price I give it 5 stars.",5
872623,"I like pants but they were really snug in the thigh/hop area until I wore them for a full day.
The draw strings are incredibly long Luke seriously hang down to your knees!!! Cutting them back of course but didn't want to until I was sure I was keeping the pants.",4
774325,"In picture it looks only one top,but actually it is a set,there 's one t back.they are sexy, inexpensive, and great underwear for my chest. I've never seen anything else that supports you while being sexy. not very short but that's good if you have nice legs. i love this . now i am a big fan of it. comfortable and cute and supportive suits me, sexy look makes me happy.",5
337143,My favorite thing about these glasses is how dark the lenses are. I live in Florida with a lot of bright sunshine so these are helpful.  They look a little bit big for my face and they fit my fiance better.  They are snug though and do not slip down. Great quality sunglasses! I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review.,5
472318,I like the pocket watches thought they are not exactly as pictured.  They are silver in color and with a ball type chain but I am still happy with them!  I didn't receive them as soon as I would have liked and almost thought that I wasn't going to receive them at all! Took well over a month to receive them.  Once I received them I was happy with them and especially for the price. I would have preferred them to be (look) as pictured!,3
697526,Overall this shirt was nice but the bottom of it is shaped weird. It ends in a huge point right by the crotch area so it makes me feel a little awkward when wearing it. Apart from that the fabric used is very soft and is definitely a quality piece of clothing.,4
843925,"The measurement are clearly not according to American sizes. The material & blouse is cute, however it's suppose to be a bodycon dress not a damn blouse. I bought large, it fit tightly, an extra large would be better, following the size instructions, & it didn't give me the correct fit. Buy a size bigger than your normal size",2
40199,"I ordered these flip flops, but they sent me the wrong size THREE times. Amazon barely helped with the returns. They allow returns, but the whole process was a mess.

So, to summarize. I had to return the three pairs of flip flops, and I never received flip flops in my size.",1
605837,"This shirt runs 2 sizes to small. I am a size 12 and depending on the style can wear M or L in tops. I could barely squeeze into this top. It is veryl thin and see through. A cami should be worn with it. Other than the size issue it is a cute top, however it's very stiff and rough like burlap. I haven't washed it so I don't know if the material will soften up.",3
481852,"I bought this shirt for my grandson with a pair of red high top converse, he looked so adorable. The shirt washes well and doesn't fade, I do turn it inside out to wash it. I will repurchase when he out grows his shirt, totally adorable with a pair of jeans or denim shorts. Also the material is a soft cotton, it's not that scratchy material.",5
167225,"I usually wear a size small pre pregnancy (125-130 lbs) I'm 5'5, small frame , now that I'm pregnancy I ordered a bunch, 1 size up in Medium & they fit perfect, I fold the waistband to sit under belly & they're very Comfy, if you want a true Capri length try the 17inches if ur not tall, the 22"" styles run at ankle length for me.",5
380011,I was so stoked to see that it arrived 3 weeks early but the fitting was completely different from what it was advertising. Luckily my sis helped me do some touch ups. It turned just like I wanted it to be. It might have been a project but it was worth it!!,2
869777,"The dress is nice, its made out of regular chiffon fabric, the inner dress liner only goes up to mid thigh. The dress fits great, but its a little small around the chest area. My boobs are suffocatin (I'm a 36 D)  but everything else fits just fine.  The length of the dress is just right for my height at 5'6. Its elegant enough to be worn at a semi formal putting but also casual enough to wear just out with friends. Pretty satisfied with this purchase.

received this product at a discounted price in exchange for a review",5
338159,"Thus worked great as a smoother where it covered, but I'm really tall and it couldn't quite cover my love handles which actually made them worse. As for my butt... It's literally concave (you may think I'm joking, but it starts like a big girl booty, dips inward in the middle, then pops back out to finish line a good butt) so there was little hope for it to begin with. It did a decent job with what it had to work with.",4
358586,If you're looking for mittens to keep little fingers warm these are not for you (sooo thin) and it's not a good idea to cover babies hands for any other reason . They need their hands free to explore the world through sensory learning! If they scratch their face trim and file nails while they're sleeping.,1
283854,I used this for my 2 week trip to Europe and it totally came in handy. It made it so much easier to organize my stuff. I give it a four star instead of 5 because the mesh did start ripping at some point but I would definitely buy this again and I would recommend it to anyone.,4
605612,"Very disappointed in this garment. I bought XL to insure plenty of room. It would barley fit a 12 year old girl. It cost to much to return the item back to China. I will try to sell this to a re-sale shop and if I am lucky I will get a few dollars,  sizing was likes a  x small",1
473714,"Basic lace trimmed cami is perfect to add a bit of coverage to those sleeveless (or not) tops. The length adds a bit of modesty. I am hesitant to give 5 stars as this definitely will shrink. Sadly, it was mis-labeled and I had to return it. Made in China. There you go.",4
217378,The image on the wallet is beautiful. However the fit and finish of the wallet is rough and sloppy.  Where the fabric wraps around to the inside it's rather rough. It would be better if they tucked  the  raw edge  of the fabric in or covered it,2
127999,"This is a great jacket. The fabric feels really nice for the price. It's light enough for my trip abroad and the fit is great! It's slightly form fitting in the areas where you'd want it to be a bit more form fitting. In other words, it doesn't add bulk. It's a nice length and I love the colors.",5
552416,I read the reviews so i will say order a size larger because they do run a little small. My daughter loves these boots. They are just what she wanted. She wears them almost everyday. It comes a little higher on the calf which i love. These boots are great quality.,5
213978,"I like this cardigan, It is how the picture is, only mine is black. At first I did not like the hoodie for I thought it was too small, and it is but it wasn't so bad. I do recommend that this cardigan hoodie is a small size, but it will fit perfectly for those who are usually medium like me so it works both ways.",4
494412,I ordered an XXL and when i received it the size is so small my petite daughter that is a women's size small will be wearing it.  (It is marked XXL too)  To bad because it looks nice.  Would love to get my money back but how when it comes from China?  Disappointed.,1
728199,"I used to buy these all the time. Mens size 10-13. I buy them for myself. I am female , wear a size 9 shoe. Womens socks don't fit me. They all shrink so much after washing, so I buy mens. These socks are long enough but so narrow on the foot. I tried many brands and they are all the same. Its really hard buying mens slouch socks anyway. .just not available.  So I have to stretch out the foot to get them on. The old slouch socks were soft and wide. ..these don't cut it.",1
402323,"I can't wait to wear this shirt! The material is soft to the touch; I would recommend washing on gentle with cold water and hang-dry to avoid fading/shrinkage. I'm in my 30's and I wear an adult shirt size of small/medium.  Since this is junior-sizing, I ordered a ""large,"" and it fits perfectly.  I recommend ordering an X-Large if your bust is bigger than a B-cup.",5
405456,"I bought this item right around Christmas for my girlfriend. After only three months of use the metal clasp that gets inserted to the bracelet broke off. I could not believe this happened. She has been extremely careful every time she puts it on and takes it off, and now I have to find someone to repair it. I will definitely not be going back to Netaya.",1
31634,Lovely! Ordered these for my mom(she is very picky) and she loves them! They fit perfectly and she said they feel nice. She likes them super loose so she can pull them up kinda far. These work well for her and I am definitely buying her more! :) happy mother happy life haha,5

213138,What a joke! This is not a dress! Its a nighty at best and that's if it fits! God forbid you have breast because if you do it won't go over them. See through like a window with a blue sheen. Can hold it up and see through the body of the dress! Hate it!! Wouldn't last one wash! Junk,1
303592,"I bought this hat and, at the same time, one for a dollar less on Amazon. In my opinion the one for a dollar less is far superior. I will never wear this hat and it is not worth the trouble to return it. Chalk this up to a very bad purchase decision on my part. I WOULD NEVER BUY AGAIN !!!!!!",1

152768,This dress does fit too big in some places and to small in others.  The sizing is a bit off for those of us in the U.S.  This dress is not a bad buy because it's unique and the material is thicker than what you'd expect.  Just be really careful when chosing a size.,4

Any suggestions?",2

Purchased a fantastic pair of glasses less than a year ago. Only worn intermittently and babied the entire time.  The coating has begun to degrade. Admitted that they know the coating can wear off sometimes but that is not covered by warranty.  Better to spend your money with a company that stands behind their products.,1

I don't imagine it would be leak proof if something inside were to spill due to the zipper, but I placed mine inside a gallon Ziploc bag after I made it through security and before I got on the plane just to be safe. I've only used it on one trip, but so far the quality is holding up well and the zipper slides with ease. I would definitely recommend this product, and I paid full price! ;)",5

They wore out faster than I think they should have for the $170 I spent at the time... I just bought a second pair though, so worth it.",4
435637,Fits perfectly in my O-Bag and my other tote systems. Fills it enough to make good use of space but not so much that I can't slip a notebook in. I like how the pockets are on the inside so I'm not having to squish my hands around to get to something small and the fact that the bottom is lined so I don't have to worry about loose items getting lost if I have to swap out from one tote to another.

The width of the ""fur"" is about half what the picture shows, and it doesn't quite hang to the length shown. If it weren't for the hook in the front, I couldn't keep it on at all. And the hook is up close to the neck, rather than midway as the picture would suggest. I am going to keep it, however.",4

I was not able to use it. but I did give it to a family member who is very young and it was perfect on them****",1

They fit her great--maybe even a tad large, so plenty of growing room. The fabric is great--comfortable and durable! These are MUCH better than any set you will find at Walmart (believe me, I looked), and I expect these to last for years!",5
421588,"I was weary to get these, because they were cheap and from a online store.  However, they have help up so far.  My others ones I bought were either really flimsy or already broke.  I haven't worn these much.  Hopefully the sides won't break at the hinge.",2
464754,"i had to try a few sizes out before finding one that fit me but finally received the 9.5 inch and it worked well. beautifully simple with clean lines and well-made clasps the only drawback is that the ends unscrew easily leaving the bracelet to open unexpectedly and losing the beads. a simple drop of wax or some other sealant will help and if you do not intend on changing the beads, a drop of superglue. i would definitely buy from this seller again.",4

31492,"I bought a pair a while ago and liked it so much I bought another pair so I can wear them more often in between laundry. The first came with pockets. The second without pockets... XD To be honest even with that, these pants are still pretty great. Haven't worn my second non-pocketed pair yet but it seems the same size and shape as the pocketed one. These pants are comfortable and loose and I wear my black ones I got at home and out, and I'm a girl so they work for both men and women.",5
404261,"The material is cheap looking, not nearly as shiny as in the photo. It's okay for a Hallowe'en costume but not much else. If you have a small waist compared to your hips/height, the waist will be wide and unflattering, like it is on me. It seems to be sewn fairly well, as in the seams are good.

The service was fine. It was delivered on time and in good condition.",3

I checked fit as expected, but you would still be safe if you ordered one size larger if you prefer a little extra room . I actually might do that when I order again! And they are very soft.",5
417750,I was very disappointed that the boot was not the boot I received and not the boot that was pictured! According to the picture I should have received the 'chunky' toddler style and instead I received a pointer toe and much more narrow boot. NOT what I wanted for my toddler!,1
225937,"I was disappointed with this skirt. The waist was entirely too small. And when we went to return it for a larger size, the seller didn't provide postage to send it back. Seeing that the seller is in Hong Kong and I am in the US it would cost an exorbitant amount of money to return. So we are just out the money  NOT HAPPY!",2
256382,Not as dressy as I'd hoped. Just straw hat with bow the same color as straw so you can't really see it. The worst part is that it was folded up to fit into a tiny plastic bag the size of my hand. The creases are awful!!! What was shipping department thinking?!?!?,2

It held onto sand no matter how many times we rinsed and washed it...it got trapped between the layers somehow.  My daughter wore a large at 18-20 pounds, and this one may not fit her by the winter.  I'll get the next size up, though, because we were happy with the overall performance, and the ruffles on it are adorable.",4
853388,"the fit is good, and the fabric is nice.  However, the color in the photo is NOT EVEN CLOSE to what you actually get.  The dress I received had a muddy green tone to it and was unwearable due to icky color.  There is a little gaping at the neckline (just like a wrap dress) so maybe a stitch or two to stabilize would help.... if you like the color.  Maybe the other colors are more true to the swatch.... but green is NOT.",2

The clasps look like they could fall off with some heavy wind, but if you belt it with a nice belt and maybe attach new clasps I think it would be great for a baby shower or something similar. I'm 5'5 and 125 pounds and a medium fit really well!",4
371560,I like this sweater for the price. I don't know what exactly I was expecting so there was nothing to be let down about. The sweater is thinner than I anticipated but it still will be a cute addition to my fall wardrobe. The material is a little itchy though and I don't know if that will become a problem or not. I would not advise to order if you're on the taller side. I am 5'0'' and the sleeves are kind of short even for my taste.,3
739006,"I read the reviews, but figured it was worth the gamble considering the price. Product arrived ahead of ETA (shipped from China) and jacket is very slick... BUT the size is WAY off! I ordered a 3XL, I normally wear a XL and can put on a large uncomfortably. I couldn't even get the 3XL around my shoulders. The 3XL is probably comparable to an American Medium. Cool jacket, though I'll never fit into it.",2
175336,I sent this to my daughter in Calif. She is expecting her first child in April. Her and my son in law just loved it. I got a call right away thanking me. I also sent the  trex pacifier with it. I cant wait to see my new grandson sporting this outfit.,5

Beautiful fit and way better then on picture!!! Fabric also was very good surprise! It have nice stretch in it and not thin. if you will follow descriptions,then sz will be just right.

I just had a little bit of trouble with the shipment, because I needed it for a costume party on October 25th, but there was a shipment destination issue and I got it on the mail by Friday the 27th; picked it up on Saturday the 28th. Just was inconvenient for me.",4
296496,"Straight out of the box, these shoes are great! Very lightweight and fits comfortably on my feet like a glove! I love most especially that the sole is not bulky like my previous running shoes  I hated those things lol! I would give them a shot and they are great for the price!",5
506874,"Perfect. I don't know what people are talking about this showed up quickly and just as ordered love it. The time ,date and seconds were super easy to set as well. No it doesn't come with instructions but if you have ever set a watch before it is not difficult to figure out. I will say it does run a little big but once a couple links are removed it will be perfect.",5
782648,"This product looks exactly like the product. There doesn't seem to be a lot of stretch in the elastic waist band or the leg holes. The top has pads you can remove. I am 5"" and 130 lbs and ordered the x-large and it fits good. The front of the bottoms is lined but the back is not. I haven't worn it yet but I'm thinking it will be see through when they get wet?",5

I am now experimenting with other brands coming in the mail, but will definitely also be buying more of these Fila skele-toes socks.",5
730252,"I love this jacket! So, after finally getting it after the price stayed in one place, I got it within the two day shipping arrival date, and it fits very well. The patches were said to be iron ons, but instead these were printed on. Only reason I'm giving this four stars, is because the lapels aren't creased, so they flap around, and the buttons on the shoulders are a cheap plastic, and don't look like they're gonna stay on for long. Overall, a really good jacket!",4
165740,"I love these leggings! They do have a slightly higher rise than Lululemon or Lilly Pulitzer leggings, but that maybe why they stay up better than their much more expensive counterparts. I don't have to keep tugging at these when jogging or working out, they stay in place. I found them to be true to size. A great quality product at a very reasonable price!",5

I got a Medium and i remember what one of the reviews said about getting an extra size up because it doesn't alway fit if you chest is too big. But the Dress is very cute and i would suggest getting it. Just get a extra size up when you do! (:",4

To note: this is a French Terry material- *not* sweatshirt material... so it's not quite as thick as I was expecting.  The zippers on the sleeves don't bother at all, and you can still fold up the sleeves if you want, or just un-zip them if you're still cooling off post-yoga/gym sweat session.

My new fave go-to for my workouts, night-outs, and casual wear!",5
799765,"As mention before, the gold necklace is not part of the shirt which i was really looking fowards to. The size runs small so order one size bigger, if you are XL i don't advice you to buy since it won't fit. It did come faster than stated though so that's a plus.",2

Luckily I have a little bit of jewelry making experience and was able to modify and fix it.  Had it not been for that and the inconvenience of this broken pieces I would have given it a five star rating.",3
290096,I ordered a large. I'm 5'4. Measurements 36 -30 -41 . It gave a little room in the stomach area because I had to get it big enough to where it wasn't too tight on my booty. I had a lot of compliments. It was so comfortable and not thin to wear it was noticeably see through when you bend over.  I loved it so much I bought another in grey. I'm excited to receive my second order. Thanks so much. Amazing price for product. Highly recommend,5

Though the shirt is baggy on me in the abdomen, (easily fixed--tuck in the shirt into my bottoms' waistband,) the sleeve length is PERFECT.

Further online research and they were indeed knock offs. Sending them back.,1

I was slightly annoyed however though because it says it's supposed to come with a three inch extender but it didn't, so now I have to order one separately. It also said it would come in a nice bag but it just came in a plastic bag. Overall, great great necklace but I wouldn't order again.",3

But, she seems happy wearing them and I don't notice any spots that rub on her feet. They stay on well too.",5
815501,These are awesome. Very sharp little set. Fit as expected and looks great on the little guy. He loves the puppy. The material is soft and durable. Great colors. They did not shrink after a wash which is always great. Five stars all around here. I am very pleased with them. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.,5

The material is lighter and softer than the Carrhart duck material.  The cut is very roomy and the slightly ""stretching"" waistband is very comfortable.  I would definitely recommend these for work pants.  By the way,  Red Kap also makes shorts just like these pants, they're great also!",5

My original bag came without the wrist strap, but the seller was amazing and replaced it in a timely manner.",5

The colors are bright but not cheesey, the material is better than I expected, and the fit was great. I'm 5'5'' 130-135lbs athletic shape (small on top and muscular legs, normally size small in shirts and 4 pants) and it fit perfectly. No complaints here!",4
460761,"So glad I bought these, so thin and comfortable. Plus I like how easy it is to do the molding for the teeth.

Delivery was fast as well; which was great because it was a last minute thing to dress up this year.",5

Sadly, I had to return it.",3

Great price, too!",5

There is also lot of space for notes/bills with 2 pockets. With the fine cloth pockets the wallet feels very thin with more than 10 cards and lot of bills which I carry regularly. This is the perfect wallet for me, as the thickness has reduced by more than half compared to my old two fold wallet. Also the price is very reasonable.",5
230622,"Arrived on time. Packed well. Arrived in basic shipping plastic. Made well- no frays or loose strings. Size 22 and it fits well. My only critique is the top. The cups are too far apart which causes the fabric to buckle in an odd way and it feels like my boobs can slip out. I will fix this myself with a few stitches. Other than that I love the set. Panty fits nice and snug and it accentuates my bottom.

This is my honest review. I have not been compensated in any way by anyone for this review. Thank you",4

It was a little awkward to get it over my tall engagement ring setting at first, but I think I'm getting the hang of it now. I didn't have any problems with the CareRing cutting off my circulation, but it does feel very strange when bending my fingers. Overall it suits my needs nicely, but I wouldn't wear it all the time.",4

I wish the company would make narrow seat bikinis like these !",4
866746,This dress fits pretty well but if you are bigger chested the buttons pull apart since the holes are stretchy material. It's pretty and comfortable but for me personally I have to safety pin the top to keep it closed. I ordered two sizes bigger than I wear knowing it was going to run small.

390874,"It was inexpensive, and I got what I paid for.  The chain came apart several times within one week of wearing.  I was able to reattach the remaining chain three times.  The last time it just came apart and was not recoverable/fixable.  The velvet was soft and it looked great on my GF, so it is a shame.  I would pay a few more bucks for a better quality fastener and chain.",1
649154,Omg this is the worst.  Do yourself a favor don't buy it.  The fabric is horrible.  The stitching is messy and the passing in the bra is terrible.  It's like one of those really cheap $5 bras from the flea market.  Save your money and run from this product! PS: came in a dollar store zip lock bag,1
761566,"I was very disappointed in this belly button ring. It's quite pretty, but the quality is not there. This ring gave me a rash not only around the piercing, but also anywhere on my skin it touched. My entire belly button had a rash.

Again - looks great, and maybe if you don't have any sensitivity to cheap metals this would work for you, but I was disappointed.",1
625146,"Small. The hood was small too, kidna weird I never seen a hood on a jacket that seemed to small. Arms arm short and overall the jacket was not made to look like what's shown in the picture. I tried to return and was asked to keep it because the return was half the price of the jacket. I gave it away.",1
678452,"I got this bag for my style-savvy aunt.  She absolutely love it... especially the size and color.
She said the bag is big enough for her daily needs without being over-sized.  Also, the color  is so bright and fun for the season.
I'm very happy that I found the bag with reasonable price, excellent quality and great attention to details.",5
851396,"I really like the swimsuit but unfortunately my chest and butt are a little big for it. My chest kinda overflows out the top and I had to keep readjusting.. it could also be that the strap for the shoulders are adjustable but do not tighten as much as they should. The bottoms were okay. The did fit around my hips but the top of my butt was not fully covered.

I received this product for free or at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.",3
732018,"This cardigan was super big! I'm 5'1"" and 105 pounds if that helps. I purchased 2 other cardigans along with the one and this was the only one that was WAY too big. I gave it to my friend who is much larger than me and it fit her perfect. The other issue is that it was not your typical cardigan material. It felt and looked like the ""dry fit"" material.",1
697088,"I love this hoodie, I just wish it was full length, the crop length is just not for me, too short, so sending back, but I loved the fabric, the color & the  leaf on the back, if I can find it in a full hoodie I will buy it!",5
94825,"Great Halloween blood. It looks very realistic both wet and also when dried on clothes or rags. As it dries, it gets a bit darker just like real blood would. It also seems to wash off fairly well, so you should be able to remove it from skin or walls, etc.",5
102213,"For the price these are great tee shirts. I have been buying Fruit of the Loom for a long time, but they're just too expensive at $10 a shirt. These are around $2 each and even if they only last 6 months they out live the much more expensive FoL's. They're a little shorter than I'd like, so they don't tuck into my pants perfectly, but when worn with another shirt tucked in they stay in place just fine.

In the past Hanes shirts haven't been very comfortable but these are. I'll be sticking with them moving forward for awhile.",5
397474,"It looks and feels well made and sturdy for very wet days. From the picture, it looked like the outside had a pretty sheen, like parachute cloth, but it's polyurethane--looks like a dull plastic finish. I got the green, but the royal might be prettier. The lining is 100% polyester, a very thin mesh for all temperatures. Someone said it's made to resist tears, and I hope that's true. The problem I've had with these items before is that they tear easily. But I think this one is made for the professional outdoors person--I hope.",4
411375,"LOVE THIS!  I'm always finding myself stuck with a bottle to open and no opener in site.  No more!  And a bonus nail clipper which is great because I'm always trying to pull tags off things, or getting a hangnail, finding something I'd like to cut but having no scissors, etc.  Second best part is the convenience of having it on my key chain.  Best part is the logo, of course.",5
626498,"I absolutely love this bag! I love it so much that I bought one in black too. It's sleek and high quality, especially for the price. Unbelievably inexpensive for a leather bag. I also love the small purse inside. I have not used the small purse as a separate bag yet, but this is a great feature for travel.",5
790803,"I bought these after an unfortunate incident at the gym when my socks fell down and my shoes made the backs of my ankles bleed pretty badly. I didn't even know tabbed socks existed until a friend told me about them. These are super soft and cushiony, and they actually stay up, even in my evil shoes. I haven't worn them to the gym yet, which will be the ultimate test, but after wearing them for a day they've stayed up so I think they'll be fine at the gym.",5
439205,Nice shirt. But there was no length chart on the back of it. That was why I bought it. Really annoyed. Update: they are saying there are no more shirts available as of right now. Don't waste your time here. They will give you your money back but I don't see a need to even spend it to not get what you want,1
22722,i really regret buying those shoes i don't even know where to start!!! they wear extremly tight i had to squeez them in!!they were not as cute as they look in the pic. im ok with wearing high heels but this heel made me feel like i was gonna fall on my face..its really a shame,1
55118,"When I got this I was a bit disappointed. From the pictures I was lead to believe that there would be two compartments. One for the checkbook stuff and one for money and cards. There isn't. Also, when I put my checkbook in it, with the register and cards, it wouldn't close. I can still use it, but highly let down. Wasn't at all what I thought it was going to be.",3
697220,"If you're buying this for a small kid it might be too big, fits more perfect on a big kid or adult. The badge was nice addition. The bandana was a little starchy was more darker in color and tad too small to tie around my neck comfortably.

It all came in good condition, the hat wasn't flatten or anything and it came super fast.",4
87000,the slip underneath is too short. the sleeves are very puffy. i guess this dress just doesn't look good on me. it looks way better in the picture. my dress did come with the belt and the belt is decent. one problem i have with the belt is that the buttons show from behind the bow. but for the price i paid it's decent for what its worth,4
752061,I love my FitKicks but did have the exact trouble as the other reviewer-the toe part separated. I love them so much that I hand-sewed it back together and that was NOT an easy job. Still worth it IMHO. I just bought 2 more pairs because I love them so very much!,4
667227,"Beautiful  stones. Actually resemble teardrops. Best packing! The stones arrived in perfect condition because of the care taken to ensure the stones didn't come in contact with each other until I unwrapped them. I only wish that the each type of stone was identified for people like me, who are novices when it comes semi-precious gemstones.",5
699007,"This dress is NOT a mini dress. My daughter is 5'8"" and it was down past her knees. Also, the band at the waist is much darker than pictured. It's almost turquoise. It was going to cost me $29 to return it to China. It's now at a consignment shop because my daughter hated it so much, she refused to wear it. IT IS UGLY IN PERSON.",1
656126,"I'm satisfied with it.my bottom frame is small with a small real butt but I'm naturally top heavy..32G..which is frustrating when looking for quality,cute,sexy swimsuits. I don't like granny, old lady swimwear and by me bring too heavy with a petite frame it's hard to find something to support by breast. I wish they would stop discriminating against top heavy women with real breast lol.",4
616062,"This is a very poorly made dress, cheap fabric, I guess based on the price I should have figured. The color is more ivory than white, the pockets in the front are very visible when the dress in on. I would not recommend this dress, I'm in the process of sending it back.",2
317294,"This is just beautiful. It arrived so quickly and definitely met my expectations. I do think it is best for a larger, taller sized person. I'm 5""6 and wear a 14-16. I think it would dwarf a petite person so keep that in mind.

I love it for me but not sure who I could buy one for! Would make a great Christmas gift for the right person at an amazing price!!!",5
509467,"I like the style, it's light weight, color is lighter than normal Khaki.  The size XS is really Petite XS, shoulder width is narrow, sleeves are also on the short side which I like. That's the main reason I didn't exchange for size S.  I repositioned buttons, and it fits me well now.  There is room for some improvement.  Not sure the size chart matches the actual jacket.  However, I really can't complain for what I paid for.",4
144594,"The pearls are glued to the metal parts with industrial glue that will give you a chemical burn if you wear them while have something over your ears like headphones. Some people don't, but if you have sensitive ears (or have any sort of allergies) stay away, because after wearing one of the pairs just for one day, my ears were covered with liquid filled bumps because of the chemical burns. If you can buy a pearl that's screwed atop of the metal part, go for that. I had to throw everything out.",1
710514,"Love the removable hood and padded shoulder stitching.  Buttons are all too loose and I had to resew all of them.  It is Classic look jacket and material is soft and thick.  Wash once and it did not shrink.  Navy Blue color truth to web display. Minor shed and too new to judge for pilling.  Order medium, and the size somewhat small especially the shoulder and it is tight.  Base the web measurement, I cannot buy large as the sleeve will be too long for me.  Luckily the material stretch therefore will keep.",4
294740,"-When 1st purchased a few of the magnets fell off right away have not tried to reglue or return because I really liked the look of the bracelet.

-Few months later
After wearing bracelet and not taking off. It looks badly worn and inside looks very tarnished.

""Copper"" Bracelet went from 5stars to 3stars!",3
401352,"I bought these back when they first came into stores.  I had the Iverson Rewind jersey and the pants matched.  So I had a ""outfit"" with everything.  Eventually a few of the buttons on the bottom of the pants fell out and I can't figure out how to repair it.  So now they are my sleeping pants and are very comfy.  At the current price, it's a great deal.",3
597648,"When I first went to get this ring I was worried it would be fragile. Other reviews mentioned it breaking. I don't know what rings they got, but its been 3 years and weve treated these rings roughly. Id even say brutal. I regularly drum it on hard surfaces, theyve been dropped on concrete and hard floors, even fell down concrete stairs. No chips or anything. Kind of amazing",5
319858,"So i bought these for $8, it says original $25, i would never spend $25 dollars on these. id say they are worth $5. they feel like those cheap thin felty gloves you'd buy from a craft store for $3. I really like the timberland brand so i figured if they put their name on it they had to be decent, but apparently not. they also run really small and tight. i probably won't wear these much honestly. would not buy again ever.",2
506192,"The dress is made well, fully lined, and good fit. The zipper pulls in back and some of the tulle cutting work is sloppy (uneven hem, weird neckline cut outs, etc.
My biggest complaint though is that the boobs are heavily boned and padded. The boning is nice for the hold, but the padding is over kill.
However, for the price this is a nice formal dress.",4
76284,"Maternity clothes are so expensive, but this BellaBand has allowed me to wear pre-pregnancy pants into my second trimester (and hopefully later).  It's very versatile - you can wear it as a belt to hold up pants that are too loose, a full belly panel when you want full coverage / smoothing over, or a half belly panel (my preferred method so I don't get overheated).  It's well worth the money considering maternity jeans are $30+.  Thanks, BellaBand!  :)",4
399073,"Arrived well packaged from Amazon.com seller. I like the tin box. Time keeping is accurate to a few seconds a day and getting better with use. Very light weight, and comfortable. Quality build is good. Should be wound twice daily. Recommend that when you pull out the Crown for setting the Time and Date, to put a drop of oil on the Crown. This will lubricate and increase the life of the seals when winding. Good buy for the price.",4
539821,"I say somewhat small because the cowl or neck piece does not fit well. Overall the item is great. Super craftsmanship, beautiful in appearance but lacking in overall functionality. It sucks that everything fits and you attempt to zip up the cowl and it doesn't fit or stay zipped. Only sizing feature that is poorly executed.",5
563409,The tights arrived with writing that appears to be Chinese or Japanese. The tights are a nice vibrant color and good quality. They are a thinner tight not think cotton they become more transparent when wearing them. They don't seem to snag very easily. Good inexpensive tights. I received this product at a discounted price for an honest review,4
215904,"These are the perfect little toddler gloves - they are soft, easy to wash and just warm enough for chilly fall or spring days.  In the winter you would definitely want something thicker and more water resistant.  The colors are true to the picture and the gloves are well sized for 3-6 year old child.",5
461867,"Very nice blouse, I ordered the L and it fit nicely (normally I wear a US 4).  There was a good amount of room for a camisole underneath (fabric not totally opaque but not see through) so I think the fit was perfect.  I prefer a casual / loose fit for work clothes so someone my size could get away with ordering M if you want a tighter fit.",5
604473,"Bought this as a gift for my mother and she absolutely loved it, the purse is very sturdy and holds its shape very well, with not being too large but holds a lot of things. She received plenty of compliments on it, and the price was very resonance for the product. Very good purchase",5
125275,This hat reminds me of that dad from Bevis and butt head. Looks like a typical my dad taking me out on a fishing trip hat. Keeps the sun out if my eyes its comfy and really durable. Not to mention a great price! I've worn this hat to music festivals and its great good air flow too so all the heat doesn't stay in the hat. I wear it when I practice with my high schools marching band for long hours so sweat is no problem to this thing. Not the most stylish but its not marketed as stylish.,5
476090,"Maybe it's just me, but when I ordered a toddler five, I was expecting to get a toddler size shoe! Not a shoe that fits me!!!!! I was so disappointed and wish I got what I ordered... toddler means toddler! The red supras is what I ordered.. the black vans is what a toddler size five shoe should look like!!!!!!!!",1
55753,"Great jacket,well made, strong material,heavy duty zipper. I Wear a large in carhartt coats and ordered the same size. Fit good with some room left for layering. If you are looking to get one of these, buy this one,worth the extra money.just like the one I had back in the day.",5
358690,"These mitts are typically most useful for a newborn still in the scratching/clawing themselves stage. However, these gloves are still too big for our slightly-larger-than-average baby at 11 weeks even as she is basically done with that stage. Could be useful later on for warmth, though they aren't particularly thick. On the plus side, they do stay on better than other newborn gloves; on the minus side, they still fall off (because they're too big, so the tightest setting on the velcro isn't terribly tight).",3
172391,"I am 5'4, 138 lbs, with a DD bust. I ordered the medium and it fits perfect. It is my first strapless dress and I love it. Perfect for trips when you want something cute to wear or even as a cover up for a swim suit. True to size.",5
37065,"I had a lot of fun with this. It's very flattering on the legs but you definitely need a garter to keep it up, if you want it to stay up high. I'm pretty small, 5'2"" and 110 pounds and it fit well. It doesn't make your body bulge etc.",5
45484,"The product worked for me as expected. It's a plastic add-on tube so I expected it to look, feel and wear like a plastic add-on tube so no disappointments there.

I use it on a small pinkie ring and my Aggie ring. Although yes, it does take a little getting used to, it feels no different than the tape I had wrapped around the ring! I just turn the ring around when washing my face to avoid any possible rubbing as others have commented. My only negative is that it collects gunk. But minor fix to just rinse them.

Overall, I'm satisfied.",4
575868,"I was sceptical about how well these would hold up in wet snow, but I took them off my daughter's hands after fifteen minutes of play and she was toasty and dry. They would easily have held up much longer. The boiled wool is naturally waterproof but also soft on my toddler's sensitive skin. At 20 months, this size is slightly larger for her, but they function fine and look adorable. The berry colour is beautiful and matches the colour scheme of her Harley Nordic bunny snowsuit and Naturino boots.",5
514927,"Very disappointed that this purse didn't last long. I bought it to wear to my birthday dinner and before I even got to the place, the chain broke! I had to use it as a clutch. The only way I would recommend this product is if it is for a one time event and you are okay with using it as only a clutch",1
827460,"Ok so these nose rings are great quality and cute. The case they come in is very nice. They aren't flimsy junk rings that are more common and hard to put in. These were a bit challenging for me to put in and will take a while to get used to.
Complaints: they are a bit more protrusive than I would have liked and the ring didn't fully go in my nose but, per another reviewer I also used pliers to close it up a bit more. Great quality for the price, I would buy these again.",4
297636,"It is hard to get the socks on even with the zipper. They may improve over time when they are used daily and washed. The craftsmanship was excellent, but they seem pretty small since my mother is petite and 95 years old. Not sure if they would work on someone larger.",3
