538897,"Nicely made, good quality material and nice snug fit. Only very minor annoyance is that the top edge is slightly crooked, covering the chrome on the left side and gradually goes to not covering the chrome on the right.
I don't know if this is their mold or if mine was just cut slightly off",4
422436,"If anyone orders shirts from this company, please know that the shirts run really small (they don't tell you that)
and they are paper thin - the quality is terrible!  They also smell really bad - and it doesnt come out after one wash.
They also start to fall apart after one wash.
They came with hreads hanging out around the sleeve hems.
Customer service person was rude and did nothing to help.
BAD ORDER - will never order from them again",1
159521,"This scarf is another large one which gives many opportunities for extra looping and knot tying. The color combinations are beautiful. It goes well with browns and gives life to plain shirts and blouses. The larger the scarf the better for me, especially when these are light weight and fluid in their movements. It's a good scarf choice all around!",5
416035,"it is great watch it feels like i had a product from the alians
the only thing i discovered is that oakley had a newer ver. of this watch with another ID with the same look
i looked alot i found out that there is a tinny diffrence between both versions
but if i knew that before i buy i would go for the newer ver. of course
but sadly i bought the old ver. by the price of ther newest
but any way no big diffrence",5
34660,"It looks just like the pic. The pockets are roomy enough you can actually put things in them. It seems to be well put together. I'm glad I happened upon this bag since my old cheap thing was falling apart.

Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is I haven't had it very long so I can't swear to it durability. It does however have an odor. And with me having asthma that isn't so great. Going to get a car freshener and see if that will help.",4
396795,I love the colors and the two piece fits really well.  The problem is the tank.  It gaps in the back and doesn't sit right.  I bought two and they both do the exact same thing. It looks weird but I really like it otherwise so I will keep them.,4
237916,"I purchased this for my mother for mother's day after she had hunted around and couldn't find them around her area.  They work really well!  They never slip like some of the cheaper brands we later found for my dad.  They are quite pretty and the colors go with everything.  They don't look like boring eyeglass holders, nor are they over the top.  They are a great length so they never get in her way.  I would reccommend these to anyone and I would definitely purchase them again.",5
369460,"I love this. It gets rid of my upper back fat (such a lovely description, lol) & my ""kangaroo pouch"" (left over baby fat even though my youngest it 3.) The only thing I don't like is how far up the back it goes. I can't wear a tank top without the back showing.",5
72241,"Well, I am a grandma of a 3 year old and when I went to buy these crocs, I looked at her old ones (which were 7-8) and thought I was buying the next size up.  I think I made a mistake with the word ""toddler"" in the description!  Yes, she is a toddler, but, I'm thinking toddler shoes are much, much, much, larger.  Not sure when she will fit in these!!!",3
771368,"Absolutely worth the price. Made in Italy, 100% silk and it feels and looks like it. If I could, I would buy another one, too. I bought this to wear with a darker green dress to a religious function. The scarf will e around my shoulders and down the front of me to minimize my size a little, to be modest and well dressed.",5
730603,I ordered this skirt in black. In the picture the seam or line of the skirt looks to be a few inches from the top- this is not the case. The seam comes about halfway down your butt and is very unflattering. It's very loose (not elastic at all) and SUPER see through. I tried to roll the seam down hoping that it would look a little better but it becomes a knee length skirt (I'm 5'6) with a very loose top band (as if for pregnant women).  I would not recommend.,1
746856,"I wanted this choker because it looks just like Ariana Grande's choker in her music video for Dangerous Woman. It isn't the most quality metal on the clasp, so I can't wear it and break out any kind of sweat. The clasp is also not that secure and has come apart a few times. I've been able to pop the links back into place.",4
546784,"I wanted to try this because it was pretty and priced well even though it was a one size deal with the bust going to 39.3"". I am a 42 but decided to give it a shot anyway because I could return.  However I was surprised it fit.  Granted it is not loose like the model, but I can wear it.  Plus the quality of the material is very good.  Not flimsy at all.  Worth the great price I paid.",4
805097,"This dress was WAY too small. Very hard for me to believe this is Plus-Size. I read the few reviews that were listed before deciding to purchase the XXL.I am normally a size 14. The dress was EXTREMELY too tight and clung to EVERY imperfection. I think the idea/style of the dress is nice, but the sizing was way off.",2
273876,"Overall very pleased with the product some of the tulle  pieces seem to have come off rather easily but I will be honest and say I'm not sure if it's because my daughter pulled at it or they were already loose.  The colors are vibrant  and I have received several compliments when she wears them.  They fit my little girls foot perfectly they are definitely not too tight but just right.  I would highly recommend this product, once she is too big for them I will use them for her ponytails!",4
224538,"This crop top is absolutely wonderful. It is a bit tight so I would recommend going up a size. I normally wear a size Small in tops with a 34C but I bought a Medium since all the reviews recommended it. The fit is perfect, not too tight but also form fitting. It ends right at the the smallest part of the waist and the material is very comfortable. I wore this to a festival all night long in the desert heat and had no problems with it not being breathable.",5
815495,This little boys crab pj outfit is super cute.  I ordered the 2T and the fit seems to be perfect.  It is light and will be perfect in the hot summer months.  The material is very thin and the back of the shirt as well as the white in the short is see through but is not an issue as he is two and they are pjs.  I did receive this product at a discount from the seller in return for honest and unbiased feedback of the product.,5
753294,"I've never seen such a cheaply made item before.  It is most definitely NOT leather.  The chains are attached with loose loops of wire, not even split rings.  Paper clips would be an improvement.  Absolutely NOT worth even $5.  I can't even give this away for free as a gag gift - it's THAT BADLY made!",1
178888,"Ordered a size 3x as according to the sizing chart. I am 5'3"", 225, 36inch chest, size D, 51 inch hips, 42 inch waist. My breasts were completely hanging out, and the elastic in the bottoms was very poor quality. but for the price, it was wearable and do able.",4
363648,"It's a bit big for short people, I'm 5 2. However once I got it tailored, it is perfect. A perfect 10 , Great Bikini. If you don't criss cross the front, then the boob part on the sides are a little bit lose. And my boobs are not small (D) those are the only negatives.",4
123879,"I've now purchased two of these hats for my son and one as a gift. They work well. However, the one I purchased July '16 is labeled Made in Vietnam (previous one purchased in Feb was labeled Made in USA). I'm bummed that they moved their production. Amazon needs to update the origin in the description.",4
84843,"The coloring looks different than the photo.  I ordered the purple tanktop and the orange is way bright and thicker and reminds me of a 70's gym top that you would wear with short shorts, if you know what i mean. ;-)  I still love it's super thin material and wear it as a pajama top or hidden layer. ;-)",4
487820,"As the picture describe, I was thinking that the scarf should be thick like jeans clothes, but its was small in length, width, and overall size...I mean thickness. I would be more glad about my purchase if it was a little more heavy with consistent thickness. it doesn't prevent well my neck from stressful cold and right now I'm using my old one less expensive dense in thickness and very voluptuous. I would recommend that scarf for kid from 6 to 12 years old due to the length and width.",3
122215,"I have been very pleased with this nightgown. The length was exactly as I measured it on myself using the information provided. The cotton is soft, of good quality, and washes well. The lace is pretty and it is very comfortable to sleep in. I am thinking of buying another in a slightly different style just for variety.",5
803981,"Beautiful dress, but poor choice of fabrics. The upper lace is super itchy/painful around the arm holes. The choker style neckline was almost choking me and Indint have a big neck. The skirt material is so delicate bc anything will snag it. The beadwork is very beautiful though. Dad thisbdress didn't work :( Im 52 140 lbs 36D  the size 8 was too small bc it would only zip up the lower half and the top half I could not zip up.",3
372820,"I wear an 8 1/2 size shoe, and bought the XL because I don't like things tight around my ankles.  They're just a little long, but once wet, that doesn't matter, but they are still a little tight around the ankle.  However, I really like them.  Using them to do water aerobics and walking in the pool.  They give you a grip on the pool bottom without wearing a shoe.  I lost my first pair, and have since re-ordered because I really like them. Would give them a 5, except for the tight ankle.",4
174270,"I'm 5' 6"",34 B medium to small built woman in her 50's. Usually wear a 4-6.
Guessing about 135 lbs? Not sure haven't weighed myself in years.
I do not have a short body.
Was nervous after reading the reviews but the XLG  fit me perfectly.
( My husband said he would hate to see the small lol)
For the price very happy with the product though took a while to receive it.
Luckily did not need it right away.",4
412476,"I bought this Venetian mask for my trip to the renaissance fair next week. For about $20.00 I honestly didn't expect much, but I was blown away by this mask.(In a good way)

This mask has the deceptive quality of looking authentic! Great design and sturdy too.
If you're on the fence about the mask, all I can say is take a look at the picture, what you see is what you get.

If you want to spend hundreds on an authentic mask right out of Venice, go right ahead, but this is the smart buy.",5
96741,"The picture makes the shoe look like it has a ""boxier"" toe rather than the ""pointier"" toe that it actually has. I have wider feet and generally need to buy a size or half size longer to get a comfortable width (in any brand of shoe). I was shooting for a rounder, broader toe design which is more comfortable for me, and I feel that the pictures of this shoe didn't accurately depict what I received, in that one detail. Otherwise, ""the shoe fits."" So I am wearing it.",4
376673,"Where to begin on the utter crapiness of these ""socks"". So I got these to go on vacation, the price seemed really good in comparison to the other invisible socks on amazon, and unneeded enough for a full week. Flash forward to the actual trip. They *WILL NOT* mother freaking stay up in the heel. They fall down about once every ten minutes and I have to stop to take off my shoe and pull them back up. My heels have blistered and the whole experience is perfectly miserable. Duck these shibby socks. Duck them in the eye.",1
571955,"The shirt is nice. I like that the back of the shirt is long enough to cover my butt. The only thing I dislike is that the chest is baggier than the hip area. Still a great shirt though, I have been using it often in place of a sweater for chilly days",4
76382,This was purchased for my daughter after hearing from a friend how much her daughter-in-law loved it.  My daughter works as an ER Tech and have found the product to be most helpful.  It keeps her from bearing parts of her skin at the most in- appropriate times.  It stays in place with the rubber band on the bottom.  She is extremely happy with this and we will purchasing more!,5
25365,It was too thick. Should've ordered the trim one. Cut around on it so I was unable to return it.  It's stated that it was for several different foot problems and my problem was Morton's Neuroma. But it was too high in the arch and uncomfortable since I have a normal arch,1
496475,"It's a very pretty suit, however I wish there was more of the blue print and less black. For some reason on me it seemed to scream black - although I want the miracle suit to firm up that middle section I don't feel like I need to wear black for additional visual slimming.  Please MIracleSuit please use some pretty colors and prints.",4
113903,"I am 5'3"" and 170lbs and large breasted. I bought a large and an extra large. This material is lovely. I was disappointed that the large was to small and the XL was to big. The XL would have fit perfect if I was taller. I believe this dress is for taller people. I am giving it 5 stars because there is nothing wrong with this dress. I just wasn't tall enough.",5
315154,"So I've only had this for a week and wore it three times. On the three wear, one of the clasp ripped from it's seam. I originally got this one due to the fact that the other one I bought from a different seller became too loose after wearing it for two weeks. BUT it it's still getting the job done so I'm keeping it. I will buy it again",3
620178,"I don't know if I am just too flat chested or what, but the arm holes seem kind of big for an extra small dress. I have other xs small dresses that do not have such large arm holes. I guess I need to stick to offline shopping when it comes to dresses.",3
609630,"Shrinks! Even hand washed it shrinks.  The first 2 mediums I bought, I thought my husband washed wrong when they shrank so I bought 2 more in XL, hand washed them and behold...same shrinkage! Have to stretch them a lot when they are wet so they are more like mediums.",2
115661,"Very cute, awesome skirt. Mine is in beige, I don't know about the other colors but mine is somewhat transparent. It should be find if you wear underwear close to your skin tone or leggings, which I intend on doing. If you can't do with a somewhat transparent skirt, I'd advice be cautious on the other colors - I don't know if they're see through but they might be. This skirt is the right amount of puffy and cute. I recommend it C: Looks just like the picture.",4
390308,"I went with the F cup. Why not go big? These girls are beautiful. They feel pretty amazing, the weight, the jiggle, the cleavage are real enough for me. These look and feel so sexy.

My chest is a 42R. The plastic straps are stretched to max. I'll need more, preferably in my size. These could be replaced with sturdier parts from a real bra, however,  and that's a possibility, too.",4
367416,I love the illusion of a two-piece dress set; it's a one-piece that I prefer to wear without the belt.  The material is stretchy and soft to the skin. Beautiful dress and love the way it fits.  I wore this dress to work and received many compliments. I stand 5ft 2in and curvy body shape and it nicely accentuates my curves.,5
69477,"I purchased this a while after I had my first son and I wish I had purchased it prior to giving birth -- this provides wonderful support, similar to the support belts they give you in the hospital. I plan on taking this to the hospital with me for baby #2.",5
277813,"I'm sure this thing would be great if I could get the right size. I am so mad. I ordered it, it came, was too small so I sent it back. I ordered a size bigger and got 2 day shipping because I am wanting it for a specific outfit I am wearing when going out of town. It came in the 2 days as promised but was the same size I returned! I am done messing with this thing. Guess I am stuck with it until hopefully I lose this baby weight and can fit it.",1
266934,"These are a fun way to emphasize the nipples. Unlike pasties, they don't really hide anything. I bought them for my wife and have been very pleased with the results.
The only trick is getting them to stay on: the nipples need to be perky for them to stay on, but that makes it hard to put them on. I needed to slightly bend them to get a tighter fit.",4
66492,"Out of this whole pack of 100 there was only 1 duplicate, and that was only because there was 101 younger rings in this bag! I have purchased multiple wholesale packs from this company and I always get one extra! I like that in a company and by doing that they are ensuring that no one gets shorted. I also go one random ball In this bag, so if anyone received a pink younger ring missing the ball that you screw on, let me know ;). I am very happy with this purchase and will buy more in the future!",5
774945,"The tank is cool, but way too small. I ordered an Extra large (and I am typically a large) and it was tight. The colors were okay, but not as bright as pictured. I thought the tank was a bit pricey for the quality. Speedy shipment. I wanted to fall in love with this one, but it missed the mark.",3
771905,"What I received was not the item shown.  If I could have given negative stars, I would have.  Apparently this is not authentic.  The bone sits all the way down in the bowl & it is dirty.  It also slides right on the bracelet, the authentic Pandora charms have to be ""screwed"" on.  Lesson learned.",1
825126,"I love, love, love these pants. They are compression and fit tighter, but they hold your tummy in. They also give you shaplier legs. They don't ""ride up"" like some pants and they have a very flattering boot leg cut. The cut of them also prevents the dreaded ""camel toe"". I would highly recommend these for exercise wear or even casual wear. They fit true to size, which should feel a bit snug. Overall, these are the greatest pants and I have bought 4 pair.",5
704903,"during  his Christmas play at school.
  The hat is made thin and the beard is short, thin and not curly. It is like the manufacture stretched out a lot of large cotton balls to make the beard. I wouldn't recommend anyone tugging on this Santa's beard.
  The hat and beard is too small for an adult male but might be ok for a petite female. Otherwise I think this definitely should be a children's hat and beard.
I would buy again for just under $7 still knowing it probably won't hold up past next Christmas.",3
275590,The Belt is very good quality and it is very easy to shorten to the length required for each person. This is the best belt I have had for working with different slacks that fit differently. Would certainly recommend this belt to anyone wanting style comfort and ease of use.,5
326704,"I should have read the reviews before buying this dress. I'm highly disappointed. the material is cheap!  I ordered  2 sizes up according to the sizes on the chart provided, and it still came a little small. I don't what to do with this dress now as I wouldn't even think about re-gifting it.",1
850408,"I thought it was going to be more like bangles and it's really not. They are individual sections that are all connected in the back. It has a magnetic clasp - very good magnets. The bands seem securely attached in the back. The outer bands are a shell looking material. Even though it was not what I was expecting, I like it. It's good for casual dress but I wouldn't wear if I got really dressed up. For the price, it's a good addition to a collection of casual jewelry",4
680670,"I ordered a size medium. I usually wear a size 6 in tops. This shirt fit fine. It was a little long(I'm 5'9), but I just folded it under. It was a little big and I I lost my shape a little by wearing it but I'm okay with that. I wore it with a black t-shirt under it to work. This shirt definitely require that something is worn underneath.",4
726827,"Very nice ring. The camo detail is better than what it seems to be in the photo. I was afraid I may not like it by the photo, but it is great. The ring has also been quite durable. I work on cars quite frequently and work a farm also with the ring on. Banging ing it and scraping it on wood, metal and all sorts of other material and it hardly shows and sign of wear or tear.",4
653307,"I wear these things almost every day, I need to order a few more pairs! So comfy! They do stretch out a little bit and roll down as the day goes on, but it doesn't make me love them any less. I may go with a medium next time instead of large just to see if that makes a difference.",5
107124,This is an excellent box with a great looking finish.  It significantly illuminates the ring and sets the mood with the LED light.  I opted to pay a little more (since I'm already spending a fortune on the ring) for quality and I was not disappointed. I would recommend this box to anyone looking for a top of the line jewelry box.,5
316469,"Wonderful fit and looks great under my dresses. Hits me at the length I wanted (5'2), which is at the knee. Fits me comfortably in the chest area (36D). Very roomy in the waist, but still looks great under dress. I bought an XL, but a L would have worked for me. The lace adds flair to my dress and makes a stylish extender! Had no problems with ordering or delivery. Arrived on time in the quoted 2weeks. Recommend.",5
640778,"This dress looks as described and fits as expected. The shipping was a tad slower than I imagined, but it came all the way from China. So that's to be expected. The material seems of good quality, and for the price, you cannot beat this deal!! Good job jaeden brand!!
I am 5""4 and will definitely need to get this hemmed. So if you're under 5""9, count on that needing to happen.",5
91768,"I wasn't expecting the fabric to be the way it was. A type of really thick and warm cheap material and made it uncomfortable to wear. Because of this, it didn't fit as well, especially after a wash. This wasn't the product I thought I would get, and so I'm a little disgruntled by it. However, it did arrive on time and in good packaging.",2
437723,"This belt is absolutely terrible. I purchased it for a beach trip I was going on. I was only able to try it while on vacation. The buckle is of very poor quality. It does not hold very well. It comes loose easily. Sorry for the bad feedback, but it is an absolute waste of money.",1
673979,When it arrived it had no wrinkles and was easy to wear. The underskirt that my daughter is going to wear as a tutu fit her perfect. She is a size 2. The crinoline made the mesh stand out. We really liked that it was 3 layers. The slip underneath made it possible to wear colored under garments. My daughter loves it and keeps asking can I keep it. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.,5
477427,"i just recv'd this product & i have to say, I'm thrilled w/ the size. I work in a jail so I'm not allowed to have big pieces of jewelry. So that said, these rings are small. Shockingly small. I will NOT be returning this, b/c i love my new rings :) & i can pass this off for a wedding band to fool the inmates!",4
745376,"YOU'VE ALMOST GOT THIS RIGHT.  WHAT THIS WRISTLET NEEDS IS AN OVER FLAP TO STORE ID'S, AND CREDIT CARDS.  I REFUSE TO BE A PACK MULE FOR BIG COMBERSOME POCKETBOOKS.  IF YOU US THE OVER FLAP TO SEPERATE THE ID AND CARDS, IT WILL MAKE CARDS, ID'S MORE ACCESSIBLE, AND MAKE A PLACE FOR A SMARTPHONE.",3
532864,"I bought this ring 4 years ago and it only recently (a few months ago) lost one of the rhinestones. I never ever take it out--not to shower, not to play a collegiate sport, literally never--and it has still held up really well. The flower part covers my whole belly button, which I personally like, but some may not like that.",5
245142,"Not only are these socks cute, but they fit perfectly.  I wear a size 9.5 shoe and have a problem finding socks that fit.  I purchased the larger size.  Have worn them several times and have put them in the washer and dryer.  Both on the cooler settings.  They did not shrink.
I plan on purchasing more in the future.  Would recommend them to all my friends.",5
548249,"I like this a lot. I bought it larger on purpose, so I believe they are true to size. The only thing that I don't like is that the snaps are cold against my skin. It's a robe, so that won't be a problem for people who buy it for that reason. I bought it to use as a nightgown. If I buy again, I will buy a smaller size.",4
438475,"If you are looking for a nice, soft scarf that will not set you back too much money.... This brand is perfect!  The price/value ratio is outstanding.  I found this style to be my favorite... But I will certainly order another one or two of different coloring and/or style!  Highly recommended!",5
401582,"They are nice for the winter if you're looking for high socks. However, they slip down a bit if you walk around. They look cute and easy to care for. Just put them in the delicate laundry bag and machine wash, no need for hand wash as the instruction says.",4
16779,Havaianas are the best.  These are a replacement pair that I had for over 10 years which I lost while on vacation. It took awhile to figure out the right size but they are perfect. I am a women's US 9 and the 41/42 is the appropriate size - not the the 39/40 as the sizing chart states.,5
730485,This will be our second purchase of Fiji Sun Baby Swimwear. Worked great last summer. Tons of complements and inquiries on where we got it. The logo came off by the end of the summer but lasted great through daily swims and beach visits.  Kept our baby cool and we look forward to another great summer with this new one!,5
56487,"I formed a nickel allergy and unfortunately could no longer wear my gold wedding band.  I have been looking for a nice alternative that was not gold or gold color and found this ring.  I LOVE it, i have received so many compliments and inquiries as to where i got it!  Ended up buying my husband a new stainless steel comfort band too so we still ""match"", funny thing is we both now have comfortable, stylish new bands after 15 years, and we spent LESS THAN $30!!  That just makes me smile!",5
79514,"Bought these for my wife and these earrings were just what she wanted: not too big, not too small, and able to be worn 24/7 without hurting her ears. Could be worn as a small stud in the first hole or a larger stud in the second hole. As some of the reviewers said, the backs are a bit shorter than on most earrings, but she had no problem with that and it actually seems to make them more comfortable to sleep in. Also liked the silicone coverings on the back. Ended up also getting the yellow gold pair.",5
409986,We've been looking for a hat for my husband.  This is a great hat but a little too big for his head.  We returned it and Casual Male XL has been more than helpful in that process. I'll definitely be buying from Casual Male XL again in the future.,4
708449,"This wallet is very gorgeous! The only reason I give it only 3 stars........ Not very big: It can't hold much more than a few cards and bills, forget about change. Card direction: the cards are tough to get in and out, I prefer horizontal vs vertical. Otherwise, I really like this wallet.",3
589850,So I ordered a small but they sent me a large.... The bottoms fit perfect but the top is a little to big. But I can still make it work. The suit is beautiful but if they sent me the right size it would have been even better. But it's a great swimsuit and worth the money.,3
94485,I was shocked to find out that one of the button hole on my cardigan was completely sealed...and the distances among buttons are not consistent. I have no idea how can this kind of product be sold. the thread is coming out from every corner of the cardigan. I am very disappointed. The product is returned.,1
348167,"It looks nothing like this , if you want to have something that looks like a two piece get something else . I honestly don't think I got the correct thing it didn't have a tie eye cover or the button. However the sellers ask me to take a photo and said I did receive the correct item , I do wish what I got looked like this !",1
70699,"Because I have several rosaries for various locations, I needed to replace one. Unfortunately, as soon as I took the rosary out of the bag, the crucifix fell off of the beads.

100428,"these are great and give you a variety of choices of use beyond the stole style which is what i bought it for.
i wish it was a speck longer.  I might sew on a few sparkly things to the ends for a richer but subtle look.  I'm going to a lot of weddings this summer and they are handy to dress up a look.",4
518052,"This is very cute and very well made.  I ordered an adult small for my 9 year old daughter as she is tall for her age.  It is a bit big on her, but she will be able to wear it for awhile as a costume and to sleep in.  I am 5'5"" and 140lbs and this fits me pretty well with room to move.  The shipping was fast and the seller was prompt in answering my questions.  VERY PLEASED with this purchase as my child is too.  VERY CUTE!!!",5
864501,"This light weigh and super cute top is a must for your closest...  I love it..  Very easy on and off.  Not heavy or hot..  Nice addition to my wardrobe.
Highly recommend.  Always check the size charts and from where the item is made/shipped.. make sure you are ordering the correct size from ""their"" chart.",5
654705,"Not even close to fitting. It comes from China and is there sizes I think. It's very cute but I gave it to my 12 year old niece and it barely fit her. Costs to much to send back and maybe get the right size next, no guarantees it will fit they are willing to send what they think will fit.",1
405403,I bought for my two year old grandson whom has a security blanket & loves Thomas the Train.  This is actually for a baby not a toddler.  Very small with a rattle sewn in at one end. A nice baby blue that is very soft but not what I was expecting or looking for.,3
194296,"It is practically impossible to find a skirt of this style these days, so I was very happy to be able to order one.  I have a lot of thigh, butt, and gut, so this style works well for me!  As other reviewers have noted, the buttons are thin and challenging to manipulate, but since I have narrow shoulders, I just slip the skirt over my head and don't bother with the buttons.  I give it a 4 instead of a 5 because the fabric feels a little cheap and pills a bit.",4
35152,"I bought 3 six packs Love these. I have them everywhere around the house, in the cars, in my bags. Quality is fine for the price and they last a good long time. One tip - get a tiny glasses screwdriver and keep it handy to tighten the screws on the glasses on a regular basis.",5
546974,"I would not have purchased this cape if I knew just how small it actually runs. I would normally buy a size medium to give myself some room underneath for my clothes, but the specifics said ""runs small,"" so I purchased a size large. It actually fits like an extra small. Very disappointed in the sizing, as I wanted this for the warmer fall & winter days. The quality is good however.",1
844321,"I received my dress earlier then expected to my disappointment it was a little to big. So I was going to return it and get a refund. Anyway I tried the dress on again today and I decided to keep it. I'm going to get it altered. This dress is made for the curvy woman. If you're tall and slim like me, it will not fit. The dress looks like the pic, the material isn't thin.",4
749834,"Its cute. As expected. I like it.
I had to update this and remove one star because after wearing it only a few times its already turning copper. Very disappinting i really like it. Maybe put a clear coat of nail polish on it right when you get it to avoid it from turning.",4
377298,"I really like this bag. It is very light weight so the only weight is all the stuff I have in it. All the pockets make it easy to organize and find things. I can carry all I want but it is not a huge bag. The only thing I'm a little concerned about is the zippers. They seen a little fragile and won't zip unless all the teeth are perfectly lined up.  Overall, I would recommend this bag.",4
55848,"This is my third Alpha Industries M65 jacket. I wear this one without a liner, during the spring time. It is water resistant, several interior pockets that I haven't used yet. My other two Alphas don't have this feature. The color is awesome, tan. My other ones black and snow tiger. And you can't beat the price. I just wish it wasn't made in China.",5
705778,These fit great and are very comfortable. The only problem is that I have had mine for a week and I'm disappointed to see that they're already wearing out in the thighs. They're great all except for that so I don't recommend wearing them all day every day like I have for work.,3
739036,"a bit small but thankfully I'm skinny ad was looking for just that, I think this was measured in Asian sizes, whicj means that everybsize is anout 1.5 smaller than what most people in the US are used too, so if your a small get a medium,  if your a medium get a large, you get the idea, otherwise its a nice jacket at a good price, I like the fact thatvthis is totally synthetic so it makes a great rain coat!",4
185355,"The petticoat came turned inside out in a vacuum sealed bag. This garment will certainly need steaming or a tumble dry, but this is expected. The style is a pull on skirt and is somewhat of a tighter fit at the waist and once it hits the hips, begins to fill out. I personally prefer this fit and flare as it's an added bit of shapewear.",5
660481,I did not like how dark the lenses are when  my came in the mail it did not look like the picture that is posted. I was a little disappointed. I was planning on ordering a couple more pairs for my friends and some other glasses but i don't know now.,1
72650,"I know sometimes these pictures don't do justice on Amazon, but these are awesome! They not only cost less than Party City or a costume place, but they are made of well-crafted material, and they look mega-sexy on! They also stretch to fit your fingers and forearm. I absolutely recommend these, and I wish there were more places I could wear them than just on Halloween as Cat Woman. I'm sure they will last quiet a while!~",5
103279,"I am a long time user and great fan of these socks as I run and cycle in them. Unfortunately these pairs seem a bit short and they always slip down in the back, where I am forced to continually pull them back up. After doing this a few times the elastic wears down and within three or four washings the socks break down to where they no longer stay up at all. Very disappointed in this purchase.",1

*  Cute design
*  Band is silicon so easy to clean and not as easily breakable for children

Cons:
*  Giant for someone who is trying to learn to tell time
*  Water resistant but not water proof, but technically that's on the description so not a major con

Note:  I received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest review",3
775971,"I bought this dress recently and I love the color and the material of the dress. It is super comfortable and a great fall style. However the dress I ordered is longer than I was expecting, I followed the sizing chart and ordered the correct size but it still seems to long, It fits great everywhere else though. I still love the dress and will definitely still wear it.",4

852678,"Love this cute jacket! I live in Florida where you don't really need to wear jackets so this concept is awesome. I also like to wear tank tops and can't show my shoulders at work so i just cover em up with this jacket!! Light and fashionable perfect for spring or summer

received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review",5
566504,"Overall the style is as expected, but the actual color is darker: khaki is actually more like copper. From the measurements size L fits me, but the sleeve feels very tight at the connection with the shoulder for any movement, well, just like shown in the picture (khaki). Good thing is there is free return.",3
688426,"we've also been itching to finally review this Spriggan Requiem. It's a balance-type Bey and the official partner of Shu! Like Legend Spriggan, Spriggan Requiem can spin both left AND right. It can change in between battles the exact same way by rotating the teeth on the back of the layer. Not only does the 0 disk weigh quite a bit more than your average one, the Zeta Driver can also change between 3 different modes. This Spriggan is extremely versatile and you'll be able to mix up your play style/performance very easily!",5
330258,"Bought this together with the rainbow mix lot.  Both were all 16 gauge pieces, but I am still happy with what I got.  The customer service with IPINK was great and the issue was resolved.  From what I gathered, there was a mix up in the description and it's  ONLY 16 gauge pieces.  Hope this helps.",5
509156,"This is really cute and looks awesome. The fabric is very thin and is only one layer in the breast area - so once it gets wet, while not see through, one can see every detail the fabric is covering. The person I bought it for put on a cover up after swimming for modesty.",4
757904,These work great to block blue light at night. Makes a big difference in getting to sleep easier. They are very dark but fine if I'm watching a bright tv. Probably wouldn't be great if you're trying to work on a computer or do anything that you need to see more clearly but fine for just hanging around the house at night. Good quality and value. I ordered a higher priced pair of yellow tinted glasses from another vendor and they weren't as good as these.,5
168457,"Exactly what I expected, and THEY DON'T TURN GREEN! I've worn 1 for about 3 weeks since I've had them, I've used no clear polish, and I've showered and washed my hands countless time while wearing them. No chipping. I'd buy them again and again, since they're considerably hard to keep track of... XD and they came super quickly!! Must buy!",5
654931,"When I put this in my cart, it was an acoustic and an electric guitar design. After I checked out and saw it had changed, I thought I'd take my chances. The print was thick and the lines were muddy. Bad execution on top of an unwanted design. Then, the seller never responded to return request so I'm filing a claim with Amazon.",1
429506,"Fits well, my husband has wide palms and has a hard time fitting gloves. Dress leather gloves are hard for me to find for him. The workmanship looks good, the leather is not real thick but it is a dress glove so I did not expect it to be thick. So they are not going to be real warm in the Wisconsin winter weather but again it will be worn for dress so not a big problem. Happy with the purchase.",5
561741,"While I like this item it fits me funny. I am 5'4"" and 180lbs so I ordered the XL. The top half fits comfortably but the crotch goes down to my knees and the legs are super long. Since I'll bring using this pretty much for lounging I'm keeping it. Nice material.",4
442437,"I love cotton marled sweaters and this one looked perfect for me. I ordinarily wear a 2X at the moment but this sweater was huge - too big in the shoulders, chest and body.  I returned it for a smaller size (am going to try a Large).  I have been losing weight and my old Ragg sweater was a 4X and really, was almost this size.  I really want one of these sweaters as they are difficult to find in cotton (my preference for a casual sweater) in the salt and pepper.",3
283168,"Went by the number sizing and not the usual S,M,L. So glad I did. I got a 2xl which is size 10-12 and it fits perfect. I usually wear a large. I am super happy with the fit- especially because I have a 3 month old and this is the first suit Im actually comfortable in. Great buy and great price. Super cute too",5
514235,"Although it is really pretty, they failed to mention this is for the TINIEST RIB/WAIST CAGE ON THE PLANET. I had gotten it tobwear with this bright yellow dress for my sister's wedding, and it the didn't even fit half way around me. Not even at the thinnest part of my body. Pretty disappointed.",2
4284,"I bought a large, I usually wear a medium. It fit light a small. Little disappointed in the size since I wanted it to hang off my body, not fit with any type of snug. It was just the opposite.  Fortunately this was a fun party where sexy was OK! I don't even think XXXL would have hung like I wanted it to!",2
747563,"I liked this bunting back because it seems soft and cozy. However, there's no way this is 0-12 months as the description suggests (which is perhaps a ridiculous expectations, thinking back...). My average-sized boy 7 month old could barely be squeezed into it (having to smoosh him down a little to get the hood on. Just to see if it'd fit). I think it would be good for a 3-6 month range (or a pretty small baby. girls are a little smaller, so that range might be extended for a girl).",3
501999,"I love this suit. I am tall and slim and this suit fits me while complimenting me very well. I love the price of it too, you really can't beat $90 when similar suits sell for as much as $500. I bought the charcoal grey version and was extremely satisfied with my purchase.",5
464507,"I've been in search of the perfect fall boots for awhile, since mine recently broke. These arrived quickly and fit perfectly. They are good quality, especially for the price. I have recieved many compliments on them. Overall I love them. The only negative I will say: if you have a larger calf these are not for you.",5
817542,"I wanted to keep this dress so bad, it is so beautiful! The material is soft and comfortable and it seems well made. It fit so flatteringly in every area except one. The shoulders were too big for me. If you have a short torso and petite shoulders, this dress probably won't work for you. I had to return it.",3
73200,It's not often you can buy clothes on-line and have them fit as perfect as these did (of course due to the tie string).  I have a big gut (unfortunately) and have been looking for these type pants for workouts for a long time.  They also look great just to wear anywhere......think there was another color available which I may purchase as well.....,5
137075,"Love these shoes, I have worn them all day and found them really comfortable with no aching feet at the end of the day. Fantastic colour and true to size. I also bought  Nike Women's Flex Supreme Tr 3 Pnk Pw/Mtllc Slvr/Cl Gry/White Training Shoe and these shoes are slightly more comfortable than those even though they look very similar.",5
723749,"They are comfortable and warm, and look good too.

They pill a little after several wears, but still, I'd give five stars due to the price.

I usually wear 28-29 jeans. My stomach is thin, but I have more fat on my legs. I bought a large pair. They fit pretty well, being a little loose at the wrist but totally acceptable.",5
399880,"I bought this buckle and loved the design that got many compliments, yet after a few months of owning it the top layer started chipping away leaving a foil like appearance to it.  Although it is not that noticable of a problem, I still notice it and find it somewhat bothersome.  But for th price it is well worth it, especially if you collect buckles this is a must have",3
715933,"Beautiful skirt, quality was better than I expected it to be. I wear a US size 10 but have a small waist but a big butt. The skirt was big in the waist but I was comfortable with it everywhere else. It was a little longer than I like my skirts but with heels and a wide belt, I had a perfect outfit.",5
372781,"My fiance and I used these in Croatia for some cliff diving, and then again to walk around in Venice when the city floods at night. They are easy to get on, stay in place, and seem to be made fairly well.

I live in Texas and do not need a liner. If you do need a liner or heavy under-layers it might be a bit tight.
Very well built jacket. Good quality material and stitching.
This jacket should serve me well for for quite some time.
Pocket are a tad small. Not true Mil-specs, but good enough for urban environment.
Classic M-65 jacket.
Recommend.",5
658854,"I would leave zero stars if I could. Not only was it NOT silver but the inner edge of the moon was rough and sharp, like something had been broken off from it.

I wouldn't have paid a dollar for what I got and I paid $15 ....terrible.",1
618569,"It's a very soft shirt and the fabric is lovely. It did fit a little small, so it's not flowy, rather it's (pleasantly) fom fitting. The only other thing is the dangles down the back are not as long or as flowy as I would have liked. But it's a cute shirt with really soft fabric.",3
344836,"So far I love this!!! I am a long time supporter of sticky boobs, as I call them. I always have bought the target ones for $20 or so. These work just as well for half the cost! They won't stay on great when you're sweaty but that comes with any brand of these.",5
157750,I normally fit in a 2XL so that's what I ordered. When I opened the package I saw right away that the color was perfect. I then took it out and held up the leggings. I called my 6 year old son over and asked him to try the leggings on. He wears a size 8/9 in the kid sections. They fit him perfectly. So obviously I didn't even try to put them on. I might be out a pair of leggings but he now has a new pair of pajama pants!,2
417912,"My kids LOVE Yellow Box flip flops. The fabric between the toes in this model makes the shoes extra comfortable, and the iridescent material is super cute. My daughter wears these all day. My only complaint is they run a little small (length wise). I ordered them in her regular size and they fit, but just barely. Her heel was close to the on the edge. I could easily have ordered a size up and they would have fit,  with room to grow.",4
508273,"Hat was too small. Funco was not helpful in the return.  Said I had to pay shipping & it was more than the cost of the hat.  Bow came attached using a glue gun and it oozed out the side.  Tacky. Wanted it for a halloween costume.  Ordered a different style thru Amazon but from a different company for the same price, quality of the new one was so much better.  Donated the old one.  So disappointed.",3
70458,This item came with a great price. It was shipped very quickly and looked lovely on arrival. This item was purchased as a gift and after it was worn for an hour it suddenly fell apart stones dropped everywhere. I can understand if it were to last only a while being as low priced as it is. But I think it could have been a bit stronger than it is made. What a terrible feeling to give someone a gift that falls apart before they take it home...,3

Highly recommend to women who like to walk or run and light a light weight, comfortable shoe.",5
181099,I bought these shorts for my weightlifting practice and cross fit training. I have absolutely loved them! It's a nice thick material that stays in place and most importantly it does not become see through when stretched (as I have found some thin fabrics to turn out quite revealing as they stretch during exercise). I've already gone back on Amazon and bought it in 6 more colors and they're my favorite shorts to train in,5

649530,"This is  a great product and a real antidote to the fact that so many women's purses that are sold today, have no internal divider, so that it is just a gaping hole, a mess, into which you throw a bunch of stuff! This solves the problem and I have several purses back in working order, due to this little organizational wonder. I would like to buy another one, but larger. IN any case, I will be buying more of this.",5
468185,Glad I went with this ring and company. I was hesitate but glad I did. I found a similar ring that I liked from a big name company and they were asking twice the price of this ring.

Nice, elegant. Not sure of durability since I had it once on me.
Point less for difficulty with ironing. Definitely need some extra time for that part.",4

He even wore them to school and pajama day and to the doctor the other day when he had an ear infection :)  even though the product says it fits 11 inch feet, they stay on my son's 7.25 inch feet.  Not saying they wouldn't fit bigger feet, but they don't slip off.",5

It is small as all others have said, little more than a few cards and trinkets may fit, just depends what and how many trinkets one has.

Hope this helps.",5
361947,"I ordered 3 of the surplice style, and I'm really impressed with them. The material is soft and not too thin, with good stitching. They look nice, are very comfortable, and fit perfectly. They didn't shrink at all when I washed and dried them normally (medium heat), and the colors I ordered (white, red, and peacock) are exactly as pictured. And, for any of my fellow breastfeeding mamas, they are perfect for nursing in (just make sure you get the right style...they currently have two different styles offered).",5

I have also compared this ring with a $300 Tungsten Carbide ring at a large jewelry retailer and could not see any difference either visually or feel.

The largest size is still very tight for my 38B size; however it stretches a little and is nice for a lacy sleep bra, which is what I meant to use it for.

It looks good on and the tight fit even offers a tiny bit of support.",3

490624,This is for my daughter's Kindergarten teacher who was my 1st grade teacher and is now retiring. A great gift to give for someone who was dedicated to educating and being a mentor in our school system for all of these years. The meaning of the Sea Shell charm is just perfect.,5
379934,"I have average sized feet, but these fit too snug around the toes and ball of the foot. Yes, I tried simply pulling a little slack of the end of each toe, but then they were too long on the toe. Give it a try, you can always return if they don't fit YOU.",2
834460,"Decent construction but the sizing seems way off.  After reading many other reviews, I decided to order an XL.  I am 6'2"" and about 200lbs.  I always wear a size L or XL, depending on the brand.  People said it runs small so I ordered a size up.  When it arrived it looked huge!  It was like a dress on me.  Plus, it was the wrong color.  I ordered the cement gray color and I received a light tan color.",3
413377,"This bangle looks really great in person!  It's nice and shiny and I love that it's stainless steel so it won't tarnish.  My only complaint is that the opening is really small so I have to have my husband help me get it on and off.  My wrists are 4 3/4"" (pretty small) and it's still difficult to maneuver into.  Once it's on however, it's fine.",4
383108,"These look like they would be nice, and maybe for women with small hips, thighs and butt. I have 40"" hips and a 30"" waist with athletic, but not slim thighs. The product is VERY tight around my thighs, too snug around my hips and doesn't cover my tush very well. They also feel a bit weird in the crotch area. I'm 5'7"" and 145lbs, so not a large person, but the L/XL is too small for me...",3
757501,"I love this print! However, it due to the material it's made of I didn't want to use it as a blanket because I have much softer ones so I hung it on my wall like a tapestry and absolutely love it! (4 stars because I didn't end up using it as a blanket)",4
647972,I have one other of these purses and I love it. I was really disappointed in this one because I ordered beige but it is more like a light yellow. Would not have ordered it if I had known it wasn't a shade of brown. Beige is a light brown color not yellow!!!!!!!,1
758398,Something I'll wear around the house and running errands - as casual clothing. Size runs a bit large. Could have gone down one size from what I normally wear and still had plenty of room in garment. Still a good purchase considering the price! (Did not shrink after washing/machine drying.),4
623826,"This shirt does not look like the picture. My father owns a black and white corvette which is what I thought was on the shirt, turns out it is an all black car on the shirt. I contacted the seller and they simply state that the shirt I received is how they look. If that is so, they need to do a better job of advertising it as it is so people know what they are getting. Not happy with this purchase at all!",1
827898,"This shirt is adorable. I love the color, the look, and design of it. The material is super soft and the shirt as a whole is well made, not cheap!  I ordered a 5T and it fits as expected. It's the perfect gift for my friends son who is super excited to be a ..... Big brother! I did receive this product at a discount for my honest review, and this is 100% honest!",5
331746,Advertised as a leather belt but it is encased in black rubber.  Buckle plating quality appears suspect.  I am wearing the belt but it feels like it might not last as long as I would like.  It was very hard to find belts of this type of buckle design.  Wish there were more choices.,2
106994,This shirt fit true-to-size and the material is extremely soft. I've washed it at least 2x a week since we bought it because the size and feel are so nice my husband wears it whenever it's clean. All the extra washings haven't effected the size or touch at all. It's still super soft and the same fit. I liked the distressed graphic and bought it as a personal wedding present for him. Between it's faded look and the soft cotton it looks and feels like an old favorite. And it's becoming one!,5

This umbrella rocks.  It is like the bionic version of a normal umbrella.  I posted a video on here to show how it works.  The umbrella is heavier than the flimsy ones I normally have.  The button that you push is not hard to push.  It is a little difficult to get the umbrella locked back down into the handle but the springs are new so it will probably get easier.",5
346182,"I bought 2 make america great hats for my BILs. I put them in nice gift bags and presented them during a family function. They were both surprised and excited that I had bought them gifts. When they took the hats out of the bags the whole room erupted in laughter! At first, they were both speechless but soon started laughing along with everyone else! I think the hats were decent for the price I paid.",4
640540,"This necklace and box are really cute. My 11-year old daughter wanted this and she's really happy with it. The jewelry box is very small, but it's metal and very sturdy. The necklace looks just like it did in the movie! This is a nice gift for a young girl.",5
384564,"This dress is really cute and cheap.  I am 27 weeks pregnant, 5'2"" and 140 pounds currently and I ordered a Medium.  The dress fits great and I am hoping it will work after I am pregnant too.  The fabric is thin and comfortable for the summer.",5
754593,"Item came damaged. One of the earrings was not hooked up properly to the inside of the other loop. Loop to connect the two was broken. By the time I noticed it was too late to return.

Update: 6/30/17
On a separate note, I repaired the loop myself and wore them a few times. Only to end up with green/blue ear lobes and sore ones to boot. Definitely two thumbs down!",2
431465,"vendors don't seem to make them as functional as before.  i had a buxton's key wallet years ago that had a front insert for an id, credit or security card.  it was easy to take out of the pocket to flash or scan it.  i've looked all over and could not find a similar one.  the fossil one is okay and am satisfied with it but i would have preferred the old buxton model with the front id insert.",4
614482,"Top quality goat skin leather backpack. All zippers work easily. Draw straps are included to compact your load. The adjustment clips for the shoulder straps do not allow for very much adjustment leaving the straps too long. There are loads of pockets for storage - but, many of the pockets are really too small for use. These drawbacks are the only reasons that I didn't give the pack 5 stars.",4
426570,"The item is definitely not as robust looking as in the picture.  I was wondering if it was plastic even.  It's pretty enough but the heart is very thin and flat, the links are like that of an actual chain and not at all intricate as it looks.  The heart has fallen off twice.  NOT worth the price and quite a letdown.",2
407510,"These are my favorite thing to wear! They are so nice looking and lenses aren't overly big like some other styles. I have a narrow face but the frames fit nice and snug over the ears and don't slip off.  Ive been getting compliments on them, everyone says they're a sharp looking pair of glasses.  The bronze/brown color is perfect and very classy looking. Worth the money. These won't disappoint.",5
291381,"I really love the color (I got yellow), the way it fits me and the length is great. I'm 502 at 140 right now and I got a medium and it looks nice and I'm looking forward to wear it next summer. You would have to either wear a black thong or some black shorts underneath because you could see your underwear it was colorful. I could actually see myself wearing it with some flat sandals or high heels.",3
858228,"I'm 5'2 and a size zero and ordered this dress in a small, it fits and looks like a large man's undershirt. It is so big that even an Xs would probably be too large as well.  This is definitely not meant to be worn by a petite lady.  I will be returning it",1
590223,"Got this to wear at this thing in the desert, and I loved it! I got a ton of compliments on it. It looked good with the hood up or down, and was well constructed and surprisingly structured. Having the hood up actually made it slightly cooler because it reflected the sun off my head. It was simple to wear, not fussy at all, and a very good top to adventure in. I highly recommend it!",5
612131,"I love these shoes!  I recently wore them to an outdoor music event and they were so comfy for walking around, even in the grass!  I ordered a half size up and I'm glad I did because they fit perfect!  I have not had any discomfort from the gel straps, as others have mentioned. I'm getting more colors!",5
789057,"I bought the long sleeve in black and love it so much I intend to buy more colors. The fit is perfect although feels a tiny bit short, even for me at 5'1"", maybe I'm just not use to the new shorter lengths. Leggings help! The dress flows nicely, not skimpy on fabric, thank goodness! Nicely made. It's just lovely and be be dressed up or down.",5
658666,This is just ok. It seems a little too big and it just doesn't really want to stay on my shoulders. It is very see through. it really only looks good with a tank top. The picture makes It look much prettier. They must have tacked it in the back for the picture or something. It is very big in real life.,3
79095,These are so cute and who doesn't love Michael Kors.  However the wedge doesn't have any flex at in you really have to grip your feet to move these.  No padding for under the foot either which made them very uncomfortable to wear for more than 30 minutes.  If you are going to an event that you don't need to walk to much and sitting is a big part these would be great.,3
427917,"It fits low on the hips. I usually wear an XS but I put on some lbs, so I got a small and they are tight. Very fitted around the leg openings. Hope they will be ok when I get back on my regular weight, but I would get a size up next time.",4
222583,This wearable blanket is exactly what I was looking for! My baby can walk around his crib easily without a blanket getting in his way. It is perfectly warm for the colder fall/winter months and it is super cute! I ordered the Medium size for my 12 month old and it is a little big on him but still fits well with room to grow. I am very happy with this purchase.,5
167853,These yoga pants are great. I found the fit true to size and the stretchy fabric is a good weight - not too thin and not too thick. They're a really good value for the price. I bought a pair and liked them so much that I ordered another. Nice color selection also!,5
489521,"This ring rocked as a Christmas gift for my boyfriends father. Just be aware that the elvish writing will not be that dark. it shows up decently well ,but depending on where your standing it almost looks like just a gold band. the closer you are the easier to make out the writing. regardless the avid LOTR fan was thrilled with his Christmas gift.",4
322896,"1) Ordered on August 22nd and received it on September 6th. FAST shipping considering over seas and snail USPS.
I needed it for London
2) well made and lined.  It is a big for my son's head and even I fit (the mom).
3) I paid more for this blue plaid over the brown one for a lighter look not as heavy tweed look
4) 4 stars because it is just plain plaid fabric and not WOOL as indicated for the blue plaid style.  I think the brown one for lower price maybe wool but not this blue one",4
2745,"The color was great, but I am only 5' 6"" and these were not long enough. I was constantly yanking them up all evening.  I would not buy them again.  If you are petite, then they would be perfect for you.  But if I were one inch taller, I don't even see how they could be wearable.",3
321014,"Adorable ball skirt! Runs a little small, I'm usually a 4-6 in dresses/pants, but can get away with a 2 in most high waisted skirts, and I ordered a size 4 and it fit, but with no room to spare. It was a little shorter than expected. Cut and material actually feels of good quality. Flared out well and hung a few inched about the ground, so I could wear with flats and it would not drag whatsoever. A perfect alternative to a $250 Eliza J skirt - I got TONS of compliments.",5
336421,This purse comes rolled up in a wee box all wrinkly. The fabric isn't that nice. It is big and things could be lost in the free-for-all center pocket. I do think it would be a good purse for traveling as you can fit a lot of crap in there.,4
762748,"I have two sisters I really should've ordered more then 1 because they both loved this necklace! It's sterling silver and so cute! It's a hand stamped style that's really in right now. It's also layered which we all loved! The necklace came in a really pretty glittery box. It's really just a perfect gift for any sister or even just to treat yourself to something special.  It's a great quality and I'll definitely be purchasing a few other styles.

I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",5
8463,"Our oldest Son loved these shoes.  He wore them until they were full of holes and rips and the sole was half gone (or gone in places) and he still wore them.  As a parent though I would have wished for a more solid, supportive shoe, but that wouldn't be ""cool"".",4
704503,"its super pretty, the picture honestly dosent do it justice but it does turn youur finger green thats the only downside about this .. i guess just like don't wear it when u wash ur hands and stuff like that & it won't turn green bc it hasn't turn mine green again (:",4
559900,Product did not fit at all. Product ordered was a medium and it was barely a small.  I did not realize the product was coming from China and could never lock down when it would be received. This was the first time I have ordered something from Amazon and been disappointed.,1
639680,"Ordered these to go with a costume. Found a pair of rectangular shaped costume glasses online with thick black frames for $5.00 but decided I liked these better even though they were double the cost. So decided to go with this pair instead. But when I received them they look nothing like the picture. In fact I am fairly certain they were the pair I decided I did not like. The frames are very thick, bulky rectangular plastic.",1
82093,"Love the look of these fun glasses! They remind me of vintage 80's, but they still look good now for a different accessory to makeup and hair style. They are slightly oversized, but not so much that they overpower my face. I normally like rimless rectangle sunglasses (gradient), but as I said these are a nice change. Very light weight but well made, and you have to take care of them like you would any sunglasses that you care about. I would recommend these.",5
282240,"This vest is pretty but I had to send back because it runs so small.  I even ordered a size up (ordered a large, just in case), but was still too little.  It is nicely made even though it is unlined. A lining would have given it a more finished look, of course, but it is very wearable as it.  If it had fit, I would definitely have kept it!",4
753783,"Bought these for an '80s costume. So far, they look nice and feel comfortable. I followed other reviewers' recommendations and went a half size up, and I found it to be completely unnecessary. I'm typically a 7.5, bought these in an 8, and they're big on me. Keeping the ones I ordered because I don't feel like going through the hassle of returning.",4
58301,"I love this wallet. I wasn't expecting it to be so big or to have so many pockets & places to stash stuff so that was definitely an added bonus. Everywhere I go, I get asked about where i got this wallet & I get compliments on it. I am very happy with it.",5
816183,"Material is thin, though not transparent. I got it in dark blue so I can't speak for the white or lighter colors. Elastic around the sleeves is pretty tight. It left marks in my forearms. The inner seam of the pocket came undone the first time I wore it. Be prepared to constantly tug it down your shoulders if you want the off-the-shoulder look. I'm 5'2"" and 140 lb and got an XL.",2
74387,"The quality isn't great but I'm just needing to use these tights one time for a run that I'm dressing up for so it's ok.
However one size fits all isn't the case! These would fit a size small to medium.
To give you an idea who they will fit,I'm 5'6 1/2
And 125lbs they fit me perfect. I'm not overweight but I'm not especially thin either. Athletic build and what weight I do carry is all in my thighs and but....",3
878810,Fits my curves in the rite places! Wrinkly on the tummy but stretchy especially islf u have a long torso. Straps can be uncomfy due to the metal and bwing busty. But I wouldn't trade them.  Looks great feels great. The bottom skirt is a good length.  I rwally love this bathing suit. Makes the bust and tummy look great,5
152343,Really like it but it was waaaay too small. Def not for a girl with boobs and a butt. I wear a medium in the US but received a 2Xl and it was too tight. The seller gave me a 30% percent discount and I cut it into a cute shirt,3
638453,"Coach said they could not repair my tote straps. 300 plus for a bag with leather straps that were falling apart? Needless to say, I was distressed. THEN I found these. They worked perfectly with my tote!! Take that Coach!!!! And they cost me much less than what Coach would have charged me if they had fixed my bag. Another point in favor of this seller in my book.",5
624626,"Love the gloves. The color....not so much. Gloves are small so if you have wide hands or longer fingers, this glove will not fit. I just made it with my somewhat slender hands. Fabric is soft & the pearl detail is so cute. The color is definitely Apricot. In the photos it looked more cream but it isn't so choose wisely. I'm gonna try & lighten them up with some color remover to match my dress. Other than that, I recommend them!",4
115061,Very pleased with product and quality. My Grand daughter is 13 months with a wide foot. She is currently wearing a size 4 wide. Based on the comments I purchased the 12-18month size. They are a bit too big but she will grow into them. These are great shoes for wide feet. I would buy again and think it is a great baby gift.,5
151553,"Save your $8 and learn to free-ball ! What a complete waste of money. When they arrived two of the pairs were ripped at the seems ! I ordered a medium and got all xx large ! In addition....these ""underwear"" are more like sheer pantyhose....perfect for the man who likes to feel like a woman, but not what I was looking for. Finally, strike #4 is that they are from China and can not be returned. Please don't waste your money unless you are looking for Ripped pantyhose in the wrong size !",1
850347,"This is a horrible shirt, I ordered the one in green and received a baby blue shirt with navy hearts on it. the Material is cheap it is poorly made and way to small. I would send it back but that would probably cost more then the shirt is worth.",1
121763,"I bought large and I am 147lbs and 5.4"" it was a little to tight for me so I had to give it to my best friend who loves it very much. She wears it's everytime and says all heads turn when she passes by. So I say it works and i 100% recommend it. Love love it cuz I wore it the first day and my behind was mwuahh....so right now am going to order the XL. Satisfied customer.",5
820838,"This sports bra combo is so cute. It fits very snug which in my opinion is a good thing. I don't like things moving around too much and if I choose to go running in it I feel much more comfortable with things staying where they are supposed to. It seems to breath well. I love the design and look of it. It is comfortable to wear.

I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. My thoughts and opinions are my own.  I was not influenced or compensated for my review in any way.",5
881018,"Fits perfectly, very comfortable!  Pretty pattern, very flattering cut.  Material was a bit on the thinner side, think I would have preferred a liner, but given how form-fitting and flattering this dress is, overall I would definitely purchase from this company again.  Length is appropriate for business/work on my frame (I'm 5'4"").",5
115067,I'm happy with the purchase!  I'm also thankful for the reviews others left regarding the fact that they run large.  My daughter is 21 months and wears a size 6 toddler shoe.  I took the advice of others and purchased the 12-18 month size and they fit her great maybe a little roomy but it's perfect!,5
588904,"Very nice fit and finish on these sunglasses.  The bifocal feature is THE BEST for those of us that use reading glasses regularly.  No more off and on between sunglasses and ""cheaters"".  The polarization is also very good.  I have several pairs of more expensive sunglasses and these are quickly becoming my favorites.",5
15359,"These orthotic inserts are comfortable and well made for the price, but are not right for running. They have just a tad too much support in the arch then is comfortable to me when jogging.

309515,"I bought this product because it said it was sterling silver and after 4 days of wearing it, I woke up this morning with a bunch of hives and it turned my finger green so it is not sterling silver.
 Update
The hives are still all around my finger and it has been itching.",1
592738,"Too small in the arms! This was not at all what I thought I was purchasing. The info on the garment stated it was spandex,well it's not! I don't know what this is it's shiney more like lingere fabric very dissapointed I would have sent it back but it's not even worth the trouble it would take do that. I wish they would send what I thought I was buying! Gave one star so I could submit my review not because it's worth giving it.",1
445850,"I bought this shirt for a bacon-loving 8 year old and he loves it.  He wears it all the time along with his bacon novelty socks that I also bought.  It's a good quality t-shirt, not one that feels like it will fall apart after a few washes.",5
44796,"The belt looks and feels exactly like I thought it would - no complaints there. My biggest hangup so far is that the clasp mechanism likes to catch the weave of the belt, either making it difficult to take off/readjust, or pulling several threads when you do. I don't anticipate it lasting more than a year.",3
477575,"I bought this to replace one that was showing its age; this is an exact replacement for my old hat. When I wear this hat, I receive compliments on it about 2 out of 5 times I wear it in public. People notice it, and they compliment me for wearing it. I will probably buy two more to back up this one. My last one lasted almost 10 years....!",5
41031,Great for winter. I do have chubby thighs so it rolls down slightly but doesn't go all the way down to knees. I'm sure it will be perfect if I ever wear with garter belts. Highly recommend if you plan to wear it under loose pants and/or with skirt (be more wary and try to wear with garter belt if you can).,4
276993,"I only give these 2 stars because atleast they look cool, for a second. Wearing them for more than that starts to bother my eyes. It's hard to see out of them and uncomfortable to wear. I always end up with a headache within minutes. I bought these a week ago and will be returning them.",2
559403,"These run very small. My husband wears a size medium in all American brief style underwear, so I ordered a Large per seller's instructions. He's 6'0"" and 175 pounds, average build. Although hubby could get them on, he said the leg holes were so tight he felt like all circulation to his legs was being cut off. They now sit abandoned in the back of his underwear drawer. Total waste of money. Unless you have very skinny legs, don't bother with these.",1
222872,"It's a very pretty necklace, but they need to update the photos. In the photos, it appears to be dark blue with antique gold metal. However, the stones are a bright teal, and the metal is a bright, shiny, tacky fake gold. A couple of the stones had fallen off, but were still in the package, so easy fix with some hot glue. It's still pretty, just not as shown.",3
261895,"I am 5 ft 7 in and about 120 lb. I usually order a meduim in jackets, this one was just a little big but not too big that it was frumpy, I just didn't want to send it back. But if I bought again I would just buy one size smaller.",4
1237,"I was very Pleased with the necklace. Of course so much better looking than the photo can show. But it does a pretty good job of showing how pretty it is. Truly love the silver box that comes with. Makes it so nice & easy when gift giving, as I usually do. I will most certainly be purchasing more items. Thank you for your quality items. Robin Griffin.",5
702701,well this is a wonderful piece. it is not what I was expecting size wise. is a little to snug even though I got  size up. I can give as a gift though so im not that upset. overall though the material is phenomenal and it does not feel cheap is a good buy if the sizes were correct. DELIVERY was super fast got it much much much sooner than expected.,3
76046,"This product is very helpful for the transition to maternity wear although its not a perfect fix. With some of my pants, I am consistently adjusting the pants and the band since the only thing holding the Bellaband to the pants is a thin strip of sticky material along the bottom. I also had intended to order a blue color but unfortunately the ordering page resets every time you try to open the sizing guide so I ultimately ordered a black band which I find more limiting since I often wear jeans. Be careful, the ordering page is tricky!",4
846818,"Very cool choker. I gave this to my daughter that loves things like this. She had a choker that recently broke, so this came at the perfect time. I love that it's not just the choker, but an entire set of black stretch designed nicely. Comes with a choker, ring and bracelet. Looks nice on her and adds to her bold look. I received this @ a discount for providing my honest opinion.",4
362290,This is just what I needed.  I have a terrible habit of falling asleep with my glasses on or taking them off and haphazardly throwing them onto my night stand.  I now just slip them into this case when I am ready to go to sleep.  Fewer scratches and less time spent hunting for my glasses in the morning.,5
588588,"This is a fantastic travel bag for any G1 MLP fan. I used this when I went to the MLP convention and other weekend trips! It's very big and has nice quality construction. I wish the lining was My Little Pony themed, instead of Iron Fist's logo stamped all over in black and white though. If they made a rolling suitcase too, that would be the best!",5
792903,"I ordered this dress for my daughter,after a debacle with another company, we found the same dress on Amazon. I was in a serious time crunch and VERY skeptical that I would receive the dress in time and terrified it would be junk. I was so grateful when it came and beyond happy when my daughter put it on, beautiful and excellent quality. I will never take a chance on another site again.",5
283481,"I was on the fence about this but the swimsuit worked surprisingly well for me. I didn't fill out the top very well as a 38B but it still looked nice and stayed in place in the ocean. The bottom has a little extra fabric once it gets wet but it didn't look too weird. For the price, this seems like a good buy. We'll see how well it holds up.",4
497968,"Look no further for a sleeping bra! This bra is supportive enough to wear out, too. I bought 4, then went back and ordered 6 more. FINALLY a SUPER comfortable, attractive, supportive bra that doesn't smash the girls (34B/C, depending). My only critique is that I wish you could tighten the straps a wee bit more for extra support. But I'm nitpicking. These bras rock. Bravo!",5
92081,"I expected more for the money.  The material is nice, but the waist band rolled immediately after putting them on.  For me, they run big. I ordered large based on the size chart and now feel like a medium would fit better.  I haven't given up on Saxx yet, but this is the second pair and I'm underwhelmed.",3
147416,"Those who complain that these don't fit correctly likely don't know what leg warmers are. They are meant to fit from ankle to just under the knee. These fit great, and keep my legs warm. I was happy to find them because I could not find any in stores. After leg surgery, I couldn't keep my legs warm. They brough such relief.",5
450354,"These shorts are made horribly! One pocket is sewn completely shut, and the button closure on the waistband couldn't be buttoned until I used a knife to make the button hole larger. I don't expect these shorts to last very long. Seriously, I would have returned them, but I didn't want to go through the hassle of doing so!
Do yourself a favor and don't buy them!!!!",1
434496,I love these dresses! I am a repeat customer and both of the dresses I've ordered fit wonderfully. The estimated shipping time is listed as much longer than the actual wait. I purchased a dress prior to my pregnancy in grey and it looked great as a size four. I purchased my second dress at thirty weeks gestation in royal blue for my baby shower and the same size looks just as great! Thats what is so appealing about this particular dress; it is both flattering and forgiving.,5
667797,"I bought a medium, it was a little big so in returned it and bought a small still big, feels like it fits the same as the medium. Cute dress and length us good so I'm going to get it altered to fit better, great price can't pass it up.",3
2528,"After one wear the leather on the top of the shoe began to bubble. It's almost as though the leather has some kind of coating, which began to separate from the leather instantly. Looks bad. Not sure about the quality of these shoes. Bostonian's are typically good. But I'm disappointing in this pair.",1
775361,"Cute little shirt! I thought the apple was a raised, sewn on applique, but its flat. The only designs that stand out on the shirt are the buttons at the top and to the left of the apple. Still love it, and it didn't shrink much when washed. I ordered a size larger because of that, and I don't regret it but it is a touch large on my daughter. Good quality.
Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased opinion.",5
129337,"Had a hard time trying to figure out the jump from 12/13 to 1s. Will have to save these, as they are huge for my 4yo. Bought a 12/13 and they are still big. Just going to wear the 10/11s for now. Love these shoes, so will keep tem for wen he grows. Can't go wrong with crocs!",5
99879,"This hat was great during this last freezing cold winter in WI.  Even when temperatures dipped to single digits (or below with windchill) this hat kept my head toasty warm.  The lining is real fur and super soft to the touch.  You can either wrap it under your chin with the clasp or pin it up on top of the hat.  Great hat, very good price!",5
624558,"Ordered up a size (L) for some freedom of movement during sleep; fit is as expected.  A couple of things that could be changed for the better:  (1)  Get rid of the (very) scratchy tag at the back of the neck; (2) Get rid of the ribbon at the front--although cute, it has a tendency to get wet when bending over the sink to wash your face.  Economical PJs, should last a few years.",3
628024,This is comfortable; soft t-shirt material. I got purple and find that it attracts lint and or pet hair like a magnet. I get one wear and then needs to be washed. As others have said it is a bit long - I am 5' 2''. Even tho it is comfortable I probably wouldn't purchase this again.,3
575867,"I love this baseball camo hat. I have the entire line of SportSeams apparel and accessories. This hat in particular fits so cute. it is a vintage distressed looking hat with the shorter military-style bill. The baseball patch is so thick and durable. Everything about this hat if perfect. In fact, I love all SportSeams products.",5
13646,Great insoles with excellent arch support that I use in multiple shoes for multiple activities. They lasted me a little under a year before I had to replace them but I work on my feet and am moving around a lot so they might last others longer. You might have to trim them a little depending on the shoe you're wearing them with but that's easy to do with a good pair of scissors.,4
53920,"The hat is adjustable, but still large. My four month old has been wearing it for a couple of months now and it's still too big on her. It works though because the ties keep it on. Nice material and soft, wide brim. I just bought a second one for our trip to the beach next week just in case anything happens to this one!  Great price for an excellent product",5
846742,I am I size large but I have big boobies so I prob should have gotten an xl but it's like a sexy fit. I'm obsessed with this bra. My boyfriend goes nuts when I wear it. It's probably my most sexy bra I own. I love the white lace and the belly straps. It's amazing.,5
239619,"I love this ring! I wanted something that I could work in without worry. This titanium is labeled as ""white"" and it looks like high polished silver or platinum. It looks elegant and not like something from a toolbox like other titanium rings I've seen. It's a comfort (rounded) band and I don't know I'm wearing it. Highly recommend!!",5
535845,"GREAT! Exactly what I wanted before, a nice THICK Nail bracelet, that was durable, and made with good materials, I bought a nail bracelet from a prior seller (no names mentioned) but it was cheap and weightless! This is bracelet has yet to leave my wrist! Thanks again...waiting for gold and rose gold (HOPEFULLY!!!) Make my wishes come true please. Thanks.",5
397274,"I have Keratoconus which is a degenerative eye disease that causes my eyes to be extra sensitive to light and wind.

Wiley-X sunglasses/goggles work great! Not only do they offer great protection from excessive light by having foam seals around the edges they also protect against wind and debris.

Technically they are goggles but they are slim enough that looking at them you would likely not know it especially when you have the sunglass arms on them instead of the bands.

At about a hundred dollars they are not cheep but in my opinion they are defiantly worth it!",5
673431,"The buckles had to be attached and I had to make holes in the overalls for the buttons, apparently the holes for where the buttons are were sewn shut. For the sizing I'm a small in the U.S. so I took the advice and got 2 sizes up and got a large and it fits perfectly. :)",4
624788,"Very chinchy & cheap looking, poor quality. I'm a size 14-16 with average sized boobs & big hips. The chest area on this dress was too tight but the hip area was fine. Mind you I purchased this item from another retailer about a year ago in white.  It was beautifully made, the picture was exactly the same as this one but when I received it it was double sheer overlay so you can't see through it with a  better fit & made better. I thought this green one would be the same, well, I was wrong!",1
116826,"I ordered these leggings last week and received them yesterday. As soon as I took them out of the packaging I could tell they were going to be thin. They felt like a pair of  tights!! I tried them on and they were completely see through. Needless to say, they are already going back today. Highly disappointed in the quality.",1
743558,"These gloves are so elegant and shear...a little tight for me, I have large arms for a woman...but they still fit me...I think I am going to give them to my daughter, they should fit her better...they will fit any average size armed person...one size fits all...I think I will wear them to bed one night for my husband before I give them away though...they are pretty sexy...they seem to be made of quality material and should last quite sometime...I received this item at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.",5
556500,"Received my order today and I am very happy with it. The material is great, very soft lace. Fits loose and pretty long.  The pattern is not the same as pictures and that is why I am giving this item 4 stars. Still very nice and definitely recommend this as a beautiful beach cover up",4
374028,"Although they are a bit larger on me (I was expected that because its one size fits all and I am pretty small) however the material feels amazing to wear and just rolling over the waste line once over they fit great!! Already got asked by a few ladies where I got them and I referred them to here. Thanks, very cool pants that I look forward to wearing a lot.",5
568679,"I will be giving this to a friend as soon as I find one that might want it. I am a women and have a fairly small face, but not exceptionally small. This is too big and slides down just walking around the house. The Velcro does adjust tight enough, but it still slides down. I purchased the full face mask at the same time to compare the two and I love it. I ordered more full face masks.",3
485722,"I wear a size 10.5 to an 11. I have big feet and slightly large calves. They fit beautifully. I love the style. I love the brown color.  My husband likes them on me.  So far they are durable. I got them for Christmas, so  I haven't had them long. They wipe clean easily. I got mud on them this morning. I'll buy another pair when I can afford to!",5
269143,Great size for lugging all my junk :) I really like the dual choice of handles. This is well made and should work out just fine for my needs. It is big enough to stash your tablet or computer as well as most all your other personel needs. I love the look and sturdiness of it also.,5
253422,"Have owned this for 8 mos now, it still has a moldy odor. The PVC material is still rigid after this period of time. The inadequacy of the main compartment zipper is still at bay.
I use it primarily for my ID/ keys, phone for the gym. It holds a Samsung S7, keys, ID, a few bills. Not nearly the amount of items described as holding.",3
698577,"Way too short to be a dress... more like a long peplum top. This is not a little peek when I bent over, more like you would be able to see all the way to the tops of my bikini panties if I raised my arms, which is absolutely ridiculous for anything labeled as a dress. I have to buy petite pants to avoid hemming, so I'm not that tall. Also ""space cotton"" is really thick polyester, which is highly misleading.",1
622124,"Dress is really pretty, but way too big in the bust area. I decided to order her regular size because she is just about to go into the next size up so no biggie of its a little big...wrong. It fell off of her even when we had the back tied as tight as it would go. I'll be returning this for an 8 and hopefully that works. I really wish I would've listened to the other reviews and ordered a size down to begin with.",4
316525,"Lovely skirt! It is a bit large on me (XS, 25 in. waist), but it fits nicely on the waist and extends to my ankles (5'7""). The skirt is not wool, but it is a soft blend that does not scratch and is lined on the inside. There is a zipper on the side of the waist and two pockets in the front. The plaid pattern is not too bold and the skirt is overall comfortable and stylish! I would recommend it for the autumn and winter.",5
817655,"The tie bar itself isn't too badly made, for the price, but the enameling is so cheaply done, it left a long black streak across my tie.  Some of this came off, but not all.  Ruined one of my favorite ties, which was far more expensive than this tie bar.  Don't buy this, unless you hate your ties, or love black rub marks on your ties.",1
268271,I love this cross body wallet/purse. The leather is rich and does not look the price at all. I love the outside pocket and size overall. I was robbed last year while carrying a wristlet. This cross body is much safer to be carrying and looks very chic. I highly recommend.,5
156416,"Excellent product!  Has a solid locking mechanism and hinges. All surfaces that have to join (have contact) when the case is closed do so without gaps, therefore, maintaining the RFID protection integrity (no where to have RFID access leakage).  I ordered (intentionally) a polished surface, so fingerprints will show until you wipe the case off.",5
399392,"This is a beautiful computer bag with lots of room.  The main compartment is roomy enough for lots of stuff so I don't have to carry a purse when flying, but there is no way to close the top of the bag, so things tend to fall out when bag is lying flat, such as through a security scanner or in an overhead bin.  Have lost things from it, including a cell phone.  It's a beautiful bag that I've gotten lots of compliments on but rather poor internal design.",3
87729,This dress is way too short & its super cheap. You get what you pay for so spend your money on something else bc the return policy is awful. I bought 4 dresses for around $40 & they wanted to only give me about $13 for all 4 dresses. If you want to return you have to pay for the shipping not only to return it but they also make you pay them for shipping it to you in the first place. Save your time & money and find another cheap outfit.,1
96093,"I get so many compliments every time I wear this dress.  It fits like a glove, I'm 5 foot 10 inches and about 135 pounds.  Nice tee shirt like material, nothing fancy but great design.  After a few wears still holding up well, some of the buttons coming loose.  Nothing you can't fix with a thread and needle though.",5
144227,"I spent to much time daily assisting my husband in his quest to find his glasses (we have three floors).  Finally had enough and headed to Amazon.  After reading the reviews I selected this brand because peole mentioned the clips.  Long story  short, I haven't had to spend another minute searching for glasses.  Asked husband about the clips he said they were great because they don't slip around",5
421836,"the color was a bit lighter then i had hoped. but over all it was beutiful. very well priced for this product. i researched the internet for a band like this for weeks.
my only problem was i thought the band was the natural skin (with the raised bumps) but it was the sanded down skin,smooth. which i think now is even a better then i had hoped.and is usually  more pricey... i did very good",5
467487,I love Allegra K brand.  Ive ordered a lot of clothing from this company and have always been super happy with my purchase.  So I was super disappointed with this shirt.  It is not up to the quality standards of their normal products.  The seams are frayed and looks like it is going to fall apart after a wash.,1
330885,"Moved three stars to one
Impossible to use. Fingers get completely bunched up inside, specially the index fingers  - it it were a toe - the nail would have fallen off by now.
Fits very small and although I bought a size ""large"" and am normally ok with medium.
Had to go in an emergency mission and buy a pair locally after trying it (medium fitted me fine)",1
505012,I bought these for a friend. She love the color and can wear them all day. She is small footed and said they were large. I am big-footed and bought myself a size 9 of these and my feet swim in them. Which is a good think if you want to wear warm thick comfy socks :),4
236592,I've never been a fan of large purses.  I've been searching for the perfect small purse for months and finally came upon this one online.  It's the perfect size and so surprisingly roomy.  My last purse only had a main compartment and a small one in front.  I love having the two separate bigger compartments.  I'm able to organize much better.  Love absolutely everything about this purse.,5
822454,"This is a great belt. The leather is a little bit stiff and thin, but for the price I don't think you'll find a higher quality leather belt. The stiffness will go away and it doesn't really detract from anything. I'm sure if it really concerned me I could rub some leather conditioning oil into it to make it more supple. I received this belt at a discount in return for agreeing to write a review of it in my own words.",5
612824,My Three year old son LOVES this hat.  He wouldn't even take it off at bedtime.  I had to wait until he was sound asleep to get take it off.  The paw prints on the backside was the detail that my son loved the most - with the exception of Rocky.,5
106388,"My son has thick thighs. I was afraid this would be a problem for him. They fit perfectly. To give you an idea how they fit, he is 4.5 months old and weights 16 lbs- his clothes size is nine months going on 12. The warmers go all the way up.",5
94439,"They look good, first of all. They are very nice sunglasses and are very comfortable. My head's a little big and it is often difficult to find sunglasses that feel good on me and look good as well. They provide nice shading from the sun while I drive, without being so dark thatit makes everything else difficult to see.

If I need to replace these glasses in the future, I would buy these again.",5
368065,"I bought this RFID Blocking wallet as a gift for my friend..
It comes with a cardboard box which is a plus for gifting..
The texture of this wallet is soft and high quality construction.
The stitches is finely sewn and very clean made inside and out.
Not very thin nor bulky.
It has nine card slots, and one see through slot good for DL plus two divided section for cash or receipt..
I really like this wallet and would like to have another one for my husband..

117437,"Basing it in the other review it did say it has no give so really I knew it might be a little small so I ordered knowing I'd have to give some allowance but I think it still came in just a little smaller than what I expected. Research and figure out what your size actually is before buying  a product, especially online.",4
322310,This belly ring is awesome. It was a little difficult to get in (hence 4 stars) but i love the flexibility and length.  Hoping the next time i have to take it out it is easy to put back in and that this will flex and last until labor.,4
427501,Great hat! The only thing you can't predict is how many patches it will have and the patches are what makes it look so interesting but mine arrived with only two but still I like the hat a lot. The hat is shipped flat so it does take some time to form it into the look you want. There is a wire inside the brim to help get into form and keep it there just be prepared to work with it awhile until you get it the way you like it.,5
307567,"I bought this as a gift for my granddaughter which normally wears a size Junior size Medium in Girls clothes, so this runs very small. It was snug but she was able to wear it. It's thin weight, but she liked it. The printing of the letters on the back of the shirt was also printed backwards.",4
328016,"Attention!! Girls who are 5'8""ish...you will love this skirt. It's a bit longer than I would prefer, but I just have to wear it a little higher on my hips. It drags on the floor otherwise. I am 5'4"" and 150 lb. I got a medium. I like how it's fitted through the hips. It makes the booty look good!",4
346794,dress too big i weigh 160 height is 5'5 i ordered a medium if u are curvy with no breast it a chance that the medium will fit too loosely at the top. thats how it was for me. the dress is gorgeous straps are made with weak fabric not supportive at all.,3
294684,"Excellent bracelet and yes to fit small wrist you can bend carefully but it will form nicely. The two ends don't have to meet together they can be offset. I like the color weight & design, I have a really small wrist & this one works great. It will also fit a bigger wrist.",5
376170,I've worn these out for a good straight 8 hours and I have to say I'm very impressed. My shirt stayed on the whole day without rising up. The only thing that bothered me was around the loop area where the edge of the band kept chafing against my foot. I wasn't sure if I was stepping in the loop in the proper direction but will give it another try the next time I wear it. Overall it did the job it was supposed to so I'm satisfied.,4
637965,"Great handbag. Soft, well made and nice looking. Exchanged the large for the smaller, which is larger than I usually carry, and have enjoyed using this bag. I particularly like the braided handles which I can grib or sling over my shoulder. If this style was offered in other colors, I would buy those too! Good value.",5
702065,"I got this in the mail today and only received half of the harness. I am unclear how i am supposed to wear half of a harness. I attached a photo. Notice how I have the front half and not the back. There are no buckles, back straps or the back rings. Completely bogus. I will be returning it for a refund. I needed this by a certain time and now I am just out of luck. So disappointing",1
877247,"This is a lovely ""Land Girls"" 1940s style dress. It does run a bit small, but the stretchiness saves it. Our biggest concern was the arm bands as they're quite snug. If they're too uncomfortable I'm fairly handy with a needle so I can snip a v vent, turn under and add a button. Hopefully I won't need to.
We purchased this for our daughter in medium. She's 5'3, 135 pounds, 34C, 35/29/39. The skirt reaches just below her knees. Very pretty!",4
531262,"I used the sizing chart and it did not help.  It fits like a tent and is shapeless.  The arm holes are so large it looks weird.  The wrinkles never come out.  I wasted my money but did not want to bother with returning.  I ordered a large, I usually wear medium.  I never know what size to order, sometimes ordering a size up is necessary...who knows?  Oh well, never again will I order from these type of companies again.",1
844096,"The jacket is cut two sizes too small for any regular human being. If you're an American size L, you'll have to go with the XXL for this jacket. In addition, the hood does not even come all the way over the head. What good is having a hood on a jacket if it's just there for decoration? Two stars for the look of the jacket, as it does look stylish. Other that that, stay away from this product if you're looking for something with functionality included.",2
192847,"They've held up for a month of being thrown in and out of my purse.  I ordered a bunch of different pairs at this price point off Amazon, and these were the only ones that didn't look like they came out of one of those toy vending machines.  I actually really like them.  The tint doesn't seem to be as dark as in the pic, though.",3
673322,"I was surprised this fit so well, I'm usually a large and went ahead and got an extra large because I know Asian clothing runs small. It's a little tight on my armpit area but not uncomfortably. I get a lot of compliments on it. It is very cute. It's not a very tailored shirt, it goes straight down but super cute",5
76390,"This was a great purchase - I would highly recommend it. I purchased both this version and the less expensive version sold at my local store by the same manufacturers. Though this version was slightly more expensive, it stays in place much better due to a sticky layer on the bottom, which prevents the band from rolling up. It's helped extend the time I could wear my own pants, which has been great.",5
54844,"This ""one-size-fits-all"" cap simply doesn't - it's more like a ""one-size-maybe-fits-a-few"".  I wear a size 7 1/4, and generally this type of cap fits.  This one is too tight and uncomfortable.  Although the construction seemed OK, I found the scale of the hat to be small and its depth at the crown to be too shallow as well.  It is being returned.",2
105704,"I don't think I would call this item leggings since they are slightly on the opaque side. To me leggings can be worn with either a short or long shirt with no worries of exposing any under garments or other private parts. I would call this product tights as you can only wear under a dress or an extremely long shirt that covers your backside. Other than that, they are comfortable and look great under a couple of dresses/long shirts that I have.",4
247543,"I love these socks! I am flat footed, have had previous foot surgeries & have a horrible time finding shoes that fit properly. Finally went to a running store to get fitted properly for shoes. Everything slipped at the heel if they were the right size. The salesperson suggested I try these socks & wow what a difference!! The shoes do not slip at all now & the little bit of compression really helps with my flat feet.  I wear a size 10 shoe (Brooks) & the size ll fits perfectly, no bunching or slipping.",5
145557,"Really pretty, but needs to be cleaned often. It's very nice and easily believable. I have a 1.21 ct diamond in my engagement ring and this was a bit larger, but still believable due to the shape. The small stones in the halo and sides are a bit wimpy, but I didn't expect a lot. Fits as expected.",4
540828,"I really loved the fit for my 15 month old and they still fit at almost 2years old, but I was disappointed that the seams have come loose after just a few months. We use a regular wash cycle and these are in a rather large laundry rotation so I would have expected them to hold up better. The absorbancy was what I would have expected. When an accident is caught quickly pants can be salvaged, but it won't hold a full pee.",3
720742,This is a gorgeous necklace with lots of detail.  It is perfect for someone that likes nature or just is drawn to a pretty and intricate design.  The quality is very good.  I am very pleased with this necklace. The size is nice.  It is big enough to be seen but still small enough to be subtle. I definitely recommend it.  I received this item at a discount for product testing and an honest review.  All opinions are my own.,5

41860,"Received this purse quickly.  I ordered this purse because I wanted pockets, and this purse doesn't disappoint.  It has a pocket for everything.  While maybe not the most stylish of purses, it's functionality makes up for it.  I also love the various zippered pockets, 6 total.  This purse is exactly what I have been looking for to meet my needs.",5
672182,I bought a 2T for my daughter and it was a little big but she will grow into it.  This outfit has been washed about 4 or 5 times since I received it and it has held up nicely.  It is soft and lightweight material and looks adorable on my little one.  It is a good buy for the price.,4
463933,"My daughter loves this set. She's a taller almost 6yr old, wears a 6-6x,I bought her a 7-8 - it fits a little big - not too big, just has room to grow. Fits the doll (American Girl) perfectly. (A little short on the pant, but that might be the fit)
Overall, a great buy and fit. I would recommend.",5
135455,"I love this sweater it is exactly what I wanted.  It said to order by bust size  which I was skeptical of but the fit is perfect. The only thing that was different is the color is a little darker then shown, which I don't care about.

You can fit a large 1911 into the space with several spare mag clips and still have room. The quality is excellent and she just loves it.  High quality at a wholesale price. Great value.

I do wish the poke ball design sat a little closer to the brim as well, would be better visual placement.  All-in-all though... pretty awesome for the price",4
733711,"Love this luggage...advertising it as ""lightweight"" is a little strong...once it's loaded it's very hard to lift into the overhead....but wheels great...does not tip over like the canvass samsonite one I purchased a year ago. Would be nice if the net divider pouch detached so it could be hung in bathroom for cosmetics.",4
404943,"Bonnet is thick and very soft ! No itch at all. Is definitely ideal for those colder months. My daughter is due in December so I have not had the pleasure of using them yet but as a mother of an already 18 month old, I know this is good quality and a great purchase !",5
287740,"Meh - what do expect from something like this? Its cheap, mailed directly from china, the material is super thin, and its a bit small. The colors and pattern don't look nearly as nice in person as they do on the model. But I did receive the correct pattern. Definitely returning this one.",2
441926,"I was skeptical that this dress would fit because I never order plus sizes.  The 12Petite fits perfectly and is not too long or too short.  The fabric is really thin, but nothing shows through.  I ordered the black which I can dress up or be casual.",4
406626,"5'8"" 160lb - Small was a perfect fit.
Contains my penis pretty well.

For the others complaining about popping out while sitting with your legs open.... well.. don't do that.

If you like your body, you'll love this.
Draw string was a little too long for my liking.
Its a pretty inexpensive swimwear alternative which is probably most socially acceptable outside the US.",4
254692,"Ok so here's the deal..if you are over weight this will not look good on you. The reviewers saying they got a large and it still doesn't fit..probably shouldn't be wearing something this revealing anyway. A lot of the reviews on here are almost invalid, especially in women's swimwear, because women of a certain size feel like they can wear the same stuff. And, when they find out they don't look good in even a large they bitch about it. How about just getting a one piece and look perfectly fine :)",4
169234,"It's expensive for underpants but I like this underpants. Inner pocket holds my family jewel nicely and snug. I wear 31 waist pants and size medium fits me fine. If you wear the size 33 or larger, you should go with bigger size. Even with size 32 waist, it might be tight depends on your shape.",4
860655,"Actually surprised at the quality! I was scared to buy from a vender with no reviews, but the dress is perfect, soft material, and actually looks just like the picture. Very well done, only thing is, I'm sure this is my bad though, I ordered medium because I wear a medium in everything but it's a little big, and very long, I needed it long but it's a lot dragging, nothing a tailor won't fix though. I do recommend this cuz I usually am rolling the dice when it comes to online shopping but this one definitely delivered ",5
453354,"Grabbed the last that I could find for a reasonable price.  To bad Thorlos discontinued this model.  When I wear these out I will have to try a new model.

These were just the right height.  Stayed above my calfs with out constricting.  Hopefully the replacement model will be just as good.",5
252553,"Garbage!! I would usually say ""get what you pay for"", but that would mean the bag would last at lest 1 hour. This bag literally got me in the an Uber ride, to my destination, then strap broke off of the metal connector. Luckily, I was still able to rig it together to keep a strap somewhat on. Then I go to unzip it, and the metal piece on the zipper broke off. Yep, all of this in less than an hour.",1
128919,The guy that said the handle and zipper is plastic is a knock off. I got mine from oakleys website directly and it's extremely durable. It shows you the dimensions before you buy it and it's exactly as they say. It's very light weight. I'm in the Marines and approve of this pack. Just learn to pack your gear better.,5
437112,"I tried this style hat for the first time....ordered one in mauve and one in gray....and was not disappointed...well made, and a nice warm blend of acrylic/rabbit hair....so very soft....I have a small head and face, so the hats slid down too much....I thought I had to return, but tried a bit of lightweight fabric inside the double liner....and they fit well....just had to make them work!!  The rhinestone trim is perfect and not overdone....comes down over the ears and has a nice slouchy style!  Cozy, warm and very stylish!!",5
555627,I love this purse! I bought it for a missions trip in a 3rd world country and this purse was the perfect size. I could carry it around in the streets and keep it close to me while also carrying just the right amount of stuff. Its perfect for travel. The ID container is easy to access but secure and the pockets are deep enough to hold plane tickets and a passport without a problem. LOVE IT. I'm still using it even after I got home.,5
409362,"Did I say Cute? Yes, it is! It is EXACTLY as it looks in the picture, fits well, has a nice part, the bangs are straight and in the shorter, Bettie Page style. The hair is fluffy, and quite real-looking, because it's not too shiny. Generally I have found that Franco makes good quality wigs. It's perfect for my burlesque act! If you want a vintage 1950s sexy look, this is IT!",5
673526,"The holes were almost too small to fit the pins through, but with some careful manipulation I got it. Didn't come with pins (my old ones are fixed into my old strap), so I had to get my own. It's beautiful and works great for my Pebble Time. Same material as the original Pebble Time strap.

When sizing it down, I recommend removing more material from the front (thumb side) of the wrist than the back. Having the clasp closer to wrist-front keeps the watch from slipping around the back of the wrist as much during wear.",4
785720,"These are awesome! They not only are the perfect size, they're comfortable and a little stretchy. I've had boxers before that just felt like the fabric had no give in it so when you'd sit down or move, it was rather uncomfortable. This is not like that. These protect you where you need it and last very well. The elastic waist band is great, too and doesn't feel like it would stretch out from being washed.",5
358433,"Material on the palm side is t-shirt thin so wouldn't prevent baby from scratching face through it.  The pattern design is simply another t-shirt layer on the top-side, so 2 layers on the top of hand and 1 layer on bottom of hand  The packaging was beautiful and its presentation would look nice as a gift.  However I returned this as it wasn't suitable for the functions I was looking for, which was thicker knit mittens to: 1) keep baby from scratching face, and 2) keep baby's hands warm while he sleeps.",2
720598,"I bought these socks for my 1 year old granddaughter and they fit perfectly. The designs are cute,and I love that they have anti skid soles,as she is soon going to walk. Another feature that I appreciate is that she has a harder time taking them off than normal socks. This is a major plus in my opinion. Would buy them again",5
67986,I bought these at the last minute to wear to a wedding and also to go with my halloween costume this year.  I got so many compliments on these shoes just at the wedding! I wear a size 8 and have a narrow foot and they fit me perfectly!,5
725639,I was disappointed because the size I ordered was a large but was from China and not an American large. My daughter saw them and took them and wore them to her Birthday party and she looked great in them. She's much smaller than I am so I didn't send them back. If you wear a large order an xxxl from the company,1
609796,"The other reviews that say this dress isn't true to size are accurate. I'm a small and ordered a small- it fits like a large. Especially on the upper half! The upper half fits like an XL. I am a 34D bust size, and the top of the dress didn't even come close to fitting or holding me in!

Don't bother with this one. ",2
33190,"I don't know how this doesn't have more reviews. I use this on almost everything I don't want soaking up water.

Tackle bag, Bates boots, my hat, camel back. Repels water perfectly.

I never did a test to see how long it holds up but someone else apparently did.

For as light of a coat you need to use, and the coat, it'll last a while.",5
291440,"I'm 5'3 155 I'm a curvy girl, so I read everyone saying it ran a little large. Taking the advice, I'd usually go with a large but decided to get a medium, it fits amazing and my man can't stop touching me in it. The material is a little thin, with this price you can't expect it not to be, so if you got a black one, don't wear a white bra (duh) other than that it's one of the best purchases I've made on Amazon",5
409693,This ring is beautiful and great for everyday wear.  I get compliments everytime I wear it. It has such a beautiful shine and the diamond etching really catches the light well. It is thin but my hand does not go unnoticed whenver I have it on. It is also comfortable not binding on your finger like some thick rings. I have washed the dishes. showered and done just about everything with my ring on and it has not lost its luster.,5
185867,"is it awesome, fits and lays great, really good costume jewelry.  very much prettier in person and is adjustable by couple inches. daughter wears is up on her neck more, the crocheted part does not lay on her collar bone and top shoulder area at all, it fits like a choker but is still good/",5
531480,I couldn't be happier with this jacket! It's absolutely gorgeous and fits perfectly! The color (Army Green) stays true to the picture and I received exactly what I saw. I am a medium but I ordered a size up which I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU DO. It also came a week earlier than expected! Thanks for such a great jacket!,5
402884,"This is an attractive easy to use travel purse. I could put different currencies in the two zippers in the front of the purse and your passport fits great in the back of the purse. I had room to carry a small bottle of medication and some bandaides just in case. I highly recommend this travel purse. I liked all the colours especially the orange and blue one.
My family loved their travel purse.",5
511345,"I bought a larger size based on the sizing chart just to be safe but it came in way too small. I bought a size 14 which should've had a bust size of at least 41"" but it measured only at 32"". My mother who's a size 8 couldn't even fit it. Lace on arms were abnormally narrow.  It all appeared defective.",1
139498,"This dress is so tiny. The measurements that are on the description are wrong. Thing material (which i expected) and tiny on the top and big on the bottom, as if it was made for a extreme pear shaped woman. If this is your body type it might fit. Overall i want to return it but because it was only $14 and came from China it is not really worth it. Might give it to my 17 year old sister for her to make a halloween costume out of it.",1
224953,I love this bag!! Bought it to use as a purse. It is a great size large enough to hold my Plum Paper planner but not bulky or baggy. The strap is easily adjusted so I can wear it as a shoulder bag or crossbody.  Lots of pockets keep everything organized. I also love the color and the fabric is water resistant. A great mommy purse.,5
166553,"Love these pants. The material is thick enough to hold you in and they are just as good as lululemon or other equally high-priced brands. Would probably recommend sizing down a bit. Also, if you're using them for heavy workouts, stick to black. The grey and some of the brighter colors tend to show sweat more.",5
137925,"Very impressive!  I've been wearing my ring steady since getting it and I love it! It doesn't get hot when washing dishes and it doesn't turn my finger colors. If my daddy were here, I would DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS RING for the veteran in your life! I would  get him this ring out of respect.  My mom doesn't deserve one.",5
371462,These are a good pair. They look exactly as the picture. My shoe size (flat heels) is normally 7. But the panda sandals tore in about 3 weeks of delicate indoor use on hardfloor. So I do not know if it is quality or the show size but they look incredibly cute and feel really warm.,3
54618,"I love these glasses, but they were heavy and didn't fit my face too well. I'm sure if I used thinner, lighter lenses and had a smaller head, they would be perfect though.

They're made in China, not Italy, but they are Ray-Bans. They have manufacturing plants in China for certain styles. They don't feel cheap. Don't forget, not everything made in China is shoddy. Think of Apple computers, your nicest smartphone and/or tablet, most cars, etc.",4
434604,"I bought this ring as a gift and wasn't disappointed. The frog design comes out great, and it is definitely worth the price. I will warn other buyers that the band itself is very cheap and looks more breakable than other rings, but that's all I have to say against it. Good product.",4
475702,"I love owl themed products, so I wanted some pajamas with owls on them.  These are adorable.  I like the bright colors.  I read on other reviews that they run a little big.  I was right between a size medium and large, so I went with the medium.  They fit well, so I would agree to err on the smaller side if you're between sizes.  They feel much softer after you wear them a bit and/or wash them.",5
25561,"Not as expected.  They're very hard and don't feel supportive at all. The reviews were good, not what I was hoping for, though.  They aren't cushy,  and make being on my feet all day long extremely difficult.  Maybe they'll work for someone else, but they didn't for me .",2
545411,"Everything else is fine except the color is Not how it shows on the picture.
The picture looks like neon pink or neon purple.
The actual color when I received was regular pink.
Maybe it was angle of light from camera or something.
But I'm giving 5 stars 'cause it was FREE return.
Not every seller offers free returns.
GREAT customer service!!!",5
416585,"I bought this ring along with 3 other color-combinations as gifts and for myself.  They arrived very promptly by US Mail.

The sizes run true to what they recommend, and are very comfortable to wear.  You should be aware that they are quite wide (wider than you would imagine in the photo)and slightly thick, so they can interfere a little with everyday tasks, however if you are a fan of big, bold rings (like myself) these are great!  I've received so many compliments, they are unique and beautifully crafted.",4
314706,"Fun hoodie, great for when it gets chillier. Funny how an additional zipper can really change up your look. You can go from casual to hip when you zip up the the inner layer and outside layer. Definitely keeps you warm too. Just wish the actual hood was a little smaller.",4
35900,Nice umbrella and my 4 year old loves it! Seems sturdy as we have used it in the rain and it was very windy.  I actually like that it is transparent therefore she is not running into people when it rains.  I also love that it encloses her and covers her more so than a standard (straight) umbrella.  I would certainly purchase again.,5
405850,"I have had this wig almost 2 years and it is still fantastic!  Every time I wear it (I am an actress, so this is often), people genuinely think that it is my real hair.  It has survived a lot of wear and tear - still looks great!",5
700086,"Beautiful ring. I love it. I thought that it would be a little more sturdy when you take the hands apart, but it's a little flimsy as if you take it apart too many times it will break. Still, I don't really see myself pulling it apart often and the silver is really pretty. Overall I Recommend THIS ring!",4
793502,"Top too small and bottoms too large. If you are 38 b this may fit, but anything larger will not. You must return at your own cost , so buyer beware. Asian sizes always difficult to figure out & there seems to be no standard. 2 stars for cute design.",2
328058,"This maxi skirt is well made, light weight, and fashionable. The color is true to how it is being depicted and the fit is perfect. The material is light weight, but thick enough to be worn during the winter months. The spandex allows this skirt to fit comfortably and not shift. In exchange for providing an unbiased review, I received this product discounted or free.",5
701780,This product doesn't even rate a 1 star.  It is very ugly and does not look anything like the picture.  The tail of the dress does not flare but is straight.  It is an ugly light army green and very cheap looking.  I ordered an XXL but the garment is about a size 7.  The company did refund 65% of the cost if I would keep it so I gave it to my granddaughter.  She can wear it around the house but it isn't nice enough to wear in public.,1
546541,"I purchased this as a gift for my husband to replace his old worn out briefcase.  This briefcase had no reviews posted, so I took a chance and I'm so glad I did.  Based on the description and the photos, it appeared to have all the features that I was looking for.  It is even nicer than described.
My husband was very pleased and he looks so professional as he leaves for work each morning carrying this classy looking briefcase.  I would certainly purchase this item again.",5
678094,"The dress is beautiful. I was so happy that it looked just like the photo and was exactly what I wanted. The front is very tight because it has a side zipper, however if I ordered a larger size the dress would be too large. I will probably wear a shaper underneath for support as the bra cups do not provide the proper support.",4
164848,Im 60 and 175 so I ordered a large. All of my leggings are a large and normally they're too big on the waist. These looked like it was a size small. I still tried them on anyways and it was entirely too small. The only reason Im giving this product two stars is because the material is nice. I would order a size up but Im too afraid that pair will be too small. I was really excited about these leggings and now Im very upset.,2
430678,"You can't beat the quality of this tee-shirt.  It is great.  Great color, exactly what I wanted.  This is I think the fourth time I have purchased from this seller and I will continue to. Great price, and a basic tee that always looks great and is a staple in your wardrobe.  Wear with jeans, skit, whatever.",5
661316,"This is what I ordered, but this is not what I received. The nose retainer I received has no soft curve - no, instead of the soft curve shown in the photo, my retainer has a 90 degree angle.  Please, tell me how I'm supposed to get a largely inflexible piece of plastic at a right angle through a straight hole without hurting myself or damaging the piercing?  I'm seriously unhappy that I paid $7 for something I can't use.",1
702594,"The dress fits really small, around the waist.  I had bought it for my daughter for her senior pictures, and it doesn't have the train on the back of the dress like the picture of the dress showed when I ordered it. It is a pretty dress, but something about the waist line makes the dress look cheap. My daughter said she liked the dress, she wasn't that excited about it when we received it as she was when we ordered it, but I guess if she liked it, guess it will be o.k.",2
200896,"I thought that these seemed a little cheap, not the highest quality. Also not sure why they give you two of some colors, rather than just another color.
My kids really like them though. They do look cute, I'm just not as wild about the material. They slip right off of our baby's head, but the 4 and 10 year old are enjoying them quite a bit.",3
128242,"I'm 5'5 and 125 lbs.  I bought this in a small and it fits perfectly.

The colour is beautiful (red) and the material feels decent.  Not too flimsy, not too heavy.  The hood is not detachable.  The length is good - it sits about mid-butt for me, which I think is practical for a rain jacket.

The only negative is that it doesn't feel particular warm in windy situations.",5
436847,"I love these shorts!! I Am 5'4 120 lbs and bought a small and I love the fit!! I could have probably done an xsmall but I like my shorts a little bit longer and these are the perfect length. I am a mommy so I wanted something long enough to not be ""hoochie mama"" but short enough to not be just ""mom""",5
162419,"I'm 5'9"", 140 lbs. The torso of this piece is too short for my body. The bodysuit is tight to pull over the shoulders and it rides up the crotch pretty good, maybe it will stretch/loosen after some wear. The sleeves are baggy from the shoulder to the elbow, but the rest is attractively skin tight elsewhere. It would be excellent if it were offeredmul varying sizes, but it's pretty decent for the price.",4
747571,I LOVE this sweater. It is SO comfortable and has just the right amount of stretch/but holds its shape nicely. It's not too warm or too light. I recommend wearing a camisole underneath for a slight chill to the air; but a t-shirt/tank top underneath with a coat over it in cold weather. This sweater is amazing for layering!,5
396219,"This is a beautiful pillow that is very well made. While these are constructed well to handle the environment of the outdoors, they match our living room throw pillow so well that use them in our living room, and they look fantastic! We absolutely love this, and the others we purchased.",5
21882,"My daughter is 6 wks old and this hat fit her!  It was slightly big but very doable, and kept the sun out of her eyes and off her neck!  It's also super light weight fabric.  The draw cord in the back allows for significant adjustment so I expect her to wear this for quite a while.  Money well spent!",5
135915,"This is a beautiful ring, absolutely beautiful. As other reviewers have stated, the sizing is a little wonky, but too off, I wear an 11.5-12 on my ring ringer, the 11 actually fits but it's too snug for long term comfort, so I suggest you go a size, size high.",5
710182,Well before you go and buy this you should contact the seller and ask them what size you should get! Tell them your size! I did that and when I got it it was the perfect size! The two stars that were not added was because of the material of fabric was used! It's a very light weight and soft material! The picture that I was looked like it was made of heavy cloth! It's not at all. Like they say you get what you pay for! :),3
58080,"Bought this for my grandson's baptism. I was leery about ordering it because people  were complaining about the quality, but after I gave it  some thought...who really cares.  It's not like he'd wear it more than once.  It ended up being super cute and we got a lot of compliments on it that day.  It could easily be a ring bearer  suit too.",5
166716,"I purchased these capris do to other peoples comments saying that these capris are NOT shiny and can wear like regular leggings with tummy control.  WRONG...... These look and feel just like any other exercise leggings. If other peoples comments would of been accurate, I would not of bought these.",4
369617,"Nice bathing suit over all.  Ordered an 18, bottoms are a bit snug if you got booty. The top could've been a size smaller and I'm a busty girl, I usually can't find a top big enough. Sadly, one of the straps was not sewed good enough, Didn't even have it on for 30 minutes and it came off, thank god this is a supportive top and it didn't expose my boob!!! I like the suit so I will just sew it back myself, very easy fix. All in all it's ok for the price.",3
779499,Not what I was expecting. I thought it would look like the pic. I was disappointed when I got them and the center of the bone where their names go looks black highlighted in red but what I received  was red outlined shiny metal center which makes it hard to make out the names. The backside is just plain metal.,2
347190,"I am 5'9"" & 155lbs and normally wear a medium or size 6 dress and read the reviews I ordered the XL. It fits just like I expected and I love it! It is sexy I just the right places. the slit doesn't show my goods with the size that I ordered. it is a little bit scratchy in spots but nothing that I couldn't deal with for a night of wear. I think I could have gone with the Large and it would've hugged me in all the right places but I like to be able to breath lol.",4
49639,"First day I wore it I was 3 days post partum, it was barley closing. In less than.a week it was too big. It would close & be loose. The sizing is very different. Going to purchase a medium but afraid it might be too small. I wear an 18 in pants but my waist is small. A large lasted me 3 days -_-",4
777926,"Doesn't fit at all, overall it looks like the picture I got the orange and blue one. Very disappointed considering that my vacation is less than two days away and now I don't have the perfect bikini I wanted. Thanks Amazon, thanks guy who shipped this piece of crap to me! Oh yeah and the clasp in the back is broken. Yay!!!",1
23631,"Ok so these aren't shoes... I'm not sure why the rating asked me about how they fit etc...

These are great boot tree's though. Well worth the money, My last pair lasted me 6yrs from this company. And the only reason I had to get new one's was my bag got stolen with my boots and said tree's in the boots. 6yrs they keep the stink out of my boots and kept them dry, as I have a wider foot they also work great for breaking in the boots to be more comfortable.",5
800039,"I haven't tried them on because I'm 37 weeks pregnant and ordered them for post partum in hopes to smooth out my squishy tummy after. Seems like good quality material and shipping was very fast! The only thing is that I ordered the 2 pack, 1 black and 1 charcoal. I ended up receiving 2 black pairs.",4
28539,The fabric on the pair I bought separated within a week or two of normal wear. The company sent me 4 or 5 more and they all separated (you think they would have sent me ones that they tested or something). I do like the Powerstep Pros and highly recommend them. Good luck,1
864981,The wrap/slit in the front of this dress is much shorter than pictured.  I had to pin it down more to make it work appropriate otherwise it would've been very revealing.  Also it's very form fitting so I'd recommend wearing some sort of shapewear under it or you'll show all of the lines/rolls/lovehandles.,3
460971,"Bought two hundred piece lots. The pins were all individually bagged and in brand new shape, all of them with the Mickey head back.

82650,"After reading other reviews about the off sizing, I thought I had guessed right in ordering a size that should work for my kids. However, they were WAY too big.  I will be returning them.  Also, the other reviews I read didn't mention the fabric: they are made out of paper-like material (I wouldn't call it fabric!)... not at all what I was hoping for.",1
746150,"I got this top in Eggplant. The neckline could go a bit lower as it looks a bit ""pulled"" if you have broader shoulders, but I'm 5.5 months pregnant and this hides the baby bump very gracefully, and I'll definitely be wearing it after pregnancy as well. I've gotten lots of compliments on it :)",4
104340,I gave this skirt 4 stars. I do not usually but clothes online but I am happy with this skirt. It fit well and it went great with the top I bought. It stays wet a really long time and the under part is a tinny bit smaller than expected but I still really like it and I am very happy with it!,4
484067,"Very disappointed when I opened this sweater and saw how tiny it was. A women's large looked like a kids small. It smelled like K-1 fuel too. It would fit my 6-year-old niece, but I wouldn't even give it to her because I wasn't sure why it smelled so bad. Very disappointed in this product.",1

426740,"This is the second pair of these slippers I have purchased.  I wear them all the time, and one of the old ones stopped working.  One of the batteries went bad also, so I got a new pair that comes with two batteries and a charger.  I have been using the old pair for about two years, so I am not too sad to have to purchase a new pair, even though they are a little pricey.",5
488315,"So. It's well put together, and I can't really complain.. The thing is, the device that makes it stick to the top of the ear makes your ears stick out not in a good way, like in an ""have you thought about having your ears pinned back?"" kind of way. Awkward. Well made, though, quality is good.",2

The quality is great and it has been holding to regular pool use this summer.  I can't say the same for another we bought a big retailer.  We read the reviews and since my daughter is sometimes a small and sometimes a medium, we went with the larger of the two. It was a good decision.",5
408929,"Although these are sterling silver, they are very light weight, so they do not hang well, making them look cheap.

I guess you have to buy the real thing... sigh.",1

One of the pairs already had holes in them, and another pair was so small that they were difficult to put on.  I suppose next time, I will purchase the next larger size and deal with them falling around my ankles; better that than having my feet turn purple. I also wish they were longer.  It's not good showing off your legs because your socks are too short.",3

783388,"Nice hoodie. It fits perfect, so the sizing is right on par. It's also nice and soft which is a plus. The words and logo are also nicely applied. It's not cheaply done and it doesn't come off after a cycle in the washing machine. I wouldn't suggest putting it in the dryer though. All around worth the money. I love this hoodie!",5

If not, maybe reconsider.",3

The black high waisted fit fantastic, however the pleather knee pair I find I have to pull up often as I walk as they ride down easily.

The material is a thicker crepe type and they are so long and heavy that if you hang them dry they will eventually weigh out the wrinkles so no need for ironing.  They are light enough to wear on a hot day but not so thin as to be seen thru.  The long attached belt is perfect for a tassled look or a bow.,5

Pros: Hat is legitimately cool
Cons: The hat's stitching started falling apart after an hour or two of use, the hat was entirely too small(felt like wearing a yamaka), ridiculous return/replacement policy with a non refundable fee...

Conclusion: I'll likely repair the hat myself and give it away to a little metal head.",1

It's a very soft, floppy hat and has good coverage so our son was well shaded both on his face and on his neck.

The see-through pouch in the front is a nice bright colour and er...accentuates things well.",5
730969,I ordered this purse the other day and I am so happy with this. The leather is of very good quality and the color is just OMG o die for. its red but not tacky. Its very beautiful and a light purse and the handles are well made and is strong and fits perfect on the shoulders. The inside is a very nice black color silky material and enough pockets to fit everything. I am really very happy with this purse and I am so glad I got it.,5

This is the first pair of colors and they did not pass the bend over test.  You could through the material when I bend over.  Will not work for my usual work outs.  Have to return",2
814658,Super super small I wear a 14 but am very busty. I ordered  3xl thinking to would be too large across the bus line. But alas it was too tight and the rest of the shirt was huge. It's too bad because it's a cute shirt and you need to tell people that a 3XL is not like a 3XL in Nordstrom's or Macy's,1

Otherwise, unit works fine and is less expensive than other winder.",3

I will order more.",4

Overall I am very happy with this product.",5

281348,I love multilayer bracelets; they give the illusion of multiple pieces of jewelry without having to put on multiple pieces. The red on this bracelet is bright and brilliant and adds a pop of color to any outfit. It's put together well and hasn't come apart or chipped even after a lot of wear (and probably tear). It's a great piece to add to your jewelry collection!,5
520842,"These are really fun to have. Originally I purchased them because I am terrible about losing and breaking my expensive sunglasses. But, for the price I am actually very happy with the quality. They come in a variety of colors; a combination of gold or silver rims with various colored lenses makes it easy to match the glasses to almost any outfit. They won't last very long if you sit on them, or drop them repeatedly on the dance floor for half a night. But, for the price who cares?",4
100863,"Been looking for a horse mask for a while and finally came across one that seemed both quality and detailed. The mask is pretty well made and has some details like muscle definition around the mouth that a lot of other masks don't have.

Really the only downside is that, at least on mine, the neck hole never really closed quite right and made the neck seem fat. Because of this it kind of threw off the look a little.

Overall a good mask at a good price but not the best.",3
632257,"We bought this as a bridesmaid dress. However, the picture provided does not remotely reflect the dress itself. First, the dress is very sheer, which is not mentioned anywhere on the product listing. Also, the color does not match the picture. It is not anywhere close to being the golden yellow that is portrayed in the picture; its instead a very pale yellow. The fabric is also very low quality and would not likely survive much of anything in regards to wear/tear. I would absolutely not recommend this product.",1

She uses it a lot and it is great quality, easy for her to open and close, and fun for her to see the rain drops splattering down above her. She also uses it sometimes when playing in the sprinkler. My younger son has always loved her umbrella, so I ordered the plain clear one for him and he is now thrilled to have a nice clear umbrella too. These are the perfect size for kids to handle and are really nice.",5

I have pretty broad shoulders so this surprised me.  Very slow shipping but they warned of that ahead of time.  I ordered 2 different shirts from the same company at the same time and this one came in more then a week later.,4
205272,"The quality on these is nice- and they look more expensive than they cost-
The only complaint I have is that the little rubber parts that sit on your nose smell really bad. i kept smelling a plastic-y asparagus pee type smell and it was driving me crazy. Then I realized that it was the rubber parts on the glasses and the smell was on my nose even after I took them off. I really like the glasses though- so I'm hoping the smell dies off in time. It's really not that bad.

UPDATE: They broke after a week",2

604718,"The slipper is super cute but it just will not stay on correctly even with a pair of socks. My one year old seems to get very frustrated by the slipper turning across his foot. The concept is great but if it doesn't stay on correctly, what's the point. I should have followed the reviews that stated this but thought that I would give it a try anyway",1
330488,"This is a kit I appreciate quite a bit. All the pieces come in a very nice box, each type are stapled together neatly, and the sizes are each in individual baggies. It threw me for a second when I noted the sizes are labbled as Xmm (i.e. 2mm, 4mm, etc.) but after a moment I found it much easier to remember. If you wanna stretch your ears, this is a great kit.",5
322935,"I got this for a friend who was turning 30, loved unicorns, but had EVERYTHING ELSE EVER with unicorns on it. She thought it was hilarious and everyone else marveled at my creative gift giving. She tried it on and it was perfect! Everything worked as expected and the pink princess hat was the cherry on top.
So for that person in your life who has everything, they probably don't have this ;)",5
469418,"just a random HUGE blue thing, that wouldn't even fit in my mouth. What a waste of money.. I know it's cheap, but this is a straight rip off. At least if I had the case, I could use THAT for something.. but no. Amazon doesn't require it's sellers to actually give you what you pay for. ugh.",1
171806,"Really cute! Beware, that because it's cheap, you need to clear coat it so that the rhinestones and silver don't fade or fall out. Also, you may want to replace the jump ring connecting the charm from the belly ring because it's flimsy. Other than that I love it and it's a great product!",5
315519,"Cute Santa hat and beard set for kids, I doubt it will fit an adult at all; the pictures are somewhat misleading. I picked this over others because I needed a Santa hat for my kid's (5-yr old) Xmas program at school. The hat is quite plush and fits perfectly, the beard is a tad too scant, but we won't be using it anyway. The only drawback is that once you get the hat off, it leaves behind a lot of red lint.",4
658454,"Absolute worst product i've ever bought on Amazon. BEWARE, you get what you pay for and this is absolute trash. Prime example of why Chinese manufacturing has horrible stereotypes. This is NOT a compression shirt at all and the screen printing is horrendous at best. Don't fall for those other false reviews (check my picture for proof). I will be requesting a full refund.",1
136058,"There is absolutely nothing interesting about this bathing suit bottom, but it fits, doesn't ride up or down or anywhere when you are actively swimming. I bought it to go with a Panache bra-sized tankini top because it was fairly cheap and all I wanted was a plain blackswim bottom in this style. It did what it was supposed to do.",4
340887,"Thought I was getting leggings these are more like spandex you would wear under a dress or skirt, Very comfy and not see through at all, very thin and stretchy. You can see EVERY nook and cranny in these. Also I am 5'1"" and they are too long for me. I'm not giving less than three stars because they are very comfortable and the quality is not bad for the price. Just don't think they are like regular leggings that you can wear as pants.",3
168078,"These are great capris.  They fit perfectly-the only complaint I have is that they are a tad long for capris, but then again I am only 5'4"" so that may be the reason.  The material is rather thick, so no see throughs.  They are very comfortable to wear.",5
808925,"If I could have chosen zero stars I wouldve. The construction of these was absolute crap. I had literally pieces of plastic digging into me in all areas of this bra, the fabric itches; it was just atrocious. Unfortunately with this item you got what you paid for. They all ended up in the trash.",1
249420,"Based on the comments from everyone I purchase a size larger than what I normally select. I am 5'4"" 124lbs I fit Medium bottoms here in the US so I decided to go with a size large when ordering this Skirt. I tried it on and it fits perfect! love the material it's very smooth almost silky. Will purchase again from this vendor.",3
30236,"I will buy more leggings in this size from this seller. They fit better than expected! (I wear a 14/16) Better than maternity hose, plus sized hose, etc...Comfortable and they do not slip off the foot. You know how some start to fall off at the foot area and even leave marks on your belly...Not this brand! Perfect. and the colors are better than pictured. Best purchase by description ever. Thanks!!!",5
363986,The product did not look exactly like the picture but I'm not disappointed. It is still a quality bathing suit and I wear it all the time. The bottoms are a bit smaller in the back but still cover enough to be comfortable in public for girls like me that aren't perfectly skinny.,4
233069,I like the idea behind this wallet since I'm a very minimalist when it comes to my wallet.  However I do not like how the blue band is vertical; keeping money with the wallet is the not the easiest. I personally believe they should add a smaller/thinner horiztonal band and make the current blue one smaller.  Not bad but the design is not as good as i had hoped.  I will be going back to my money clip wallet i used previously since it has a magent clasp for cash.,3
503739,"Love these shoes, BUT the strap broke on one of them the very first day my 3 year old wore them. (The button snapped off that holds it). He still wears them all the time, we just put the strap of the other one to the front, so he wears them backless. It's a bummer though because he needs shoes with backs for pre-school...

This would be a 5 star review if the strap didn't break. This is the 2nd pair this has happened to...",3
354487,"Quality of the tie is awesome. I also love the bow tie. I bought it for my little brother he loves it. The timeleness of this product was great and I love the color of it as well.

I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an unbiased review",5
132525,This is the most comfiest stylish sweat shirt. Yes it is a sweatshirt. The image gives the impression of a different sleeker shirt and as other comments posted...yes the buttons r  crooked but does not impair the overall look of the shirt. Would have given 5 stars if the image was like what u actually get....I would buy this again because it is so comfy to wear.,4
500064,"I bought this product for daily use at work, but it didn't last much. Using 3 or 4 days per week, I would expect being able to  use this for at least a couple of years (like the Vintage Heritage did), but I was very dissapointed when realized the quality began to dessapear on it. Because the top of it began to wear down, I had to stop using it.",2
52839,"I purchased the 12-18 month size for my 15mo who has a head circumference in the 70th percentile - fits great!  She has another inch or so to grow into this summer.  Easy to put on and adjust to her head size, works well at the beach/pool with the wide brim.",5
752695,This is such a nice jacket. I purchased it for my 9 year old son and sized up so that he can wear it for a few seasons. The jacket itself feels light weight but he said it's still really warm. I love North Face because of their quality and my kids have also grown to appreciate the brand as well.,5
714394,"Pretty sure these are NOT actually made of the stones as advertised. I was cleaning my ""jade"" ones and the q-tip got green on it. Stones don't bleed colors. Extremely disappointed. This also explains why my ears are swelling. I'm having an allergic reaction. I have very sensitive ears and ordered these for that reason. I will never order from them again and also want to pursue further action. Seriously, people have allergies. You can't just write bs.",1
177123,"The thing about this, even though it's nice, the sizing is off, the bottom is a little slack for my butt and my boobs are being stiffled. I got a medium with 32D chest. I mean I love it none the less! Only other thing is the straps needs constant adjusting cuz it is a thin flimsy piece of cloth, so it rolls up and looks bad.",5
534258,I love the dress and it came much faster than expected which is good. I usually hate strapless dresses bc they always lower but I was surprised to see that the back is actually elastic which is not shown in the picture while the front of it is not. It helps keep the dress up which I was really excited about since I was already thinking about sewing on straps. The material is nice and cool too so its good for summer. Great buy.,5
591761,I love this band.  It's great when I just want a plain band to wear.  The low profile of this ring makes it extremely comfortable to wear.  I've never had a problem with it tarnishing or leaving a green mark on my finger like I've had with other rings.,5
614642,"This product is truley amazing! I'm 165 pounds, curvy, and I have a little bigger then your average bum lol but this still fits so great and it looks so nice! I love the galaxy design this is just so beautiful and I will totally buy this again in a different design!!",5
42790,I bought these for my brother because he either breaks or mislays his reading glasses quite frequently.  It's difficult to find multi-packs in stores in this strength for a reasonable price.  +3 Magnification.  He is very happy getting 6 pairs for less than the price of one at a grocery store.  He was delighted with them.,5
256764,I really like the swimsuit but the top does not provide much support. I'm afraid to get in the water with it for fear that the weight of the water will pull it down when I'm getting out. I also noticed that the top and bottom are two different shades of black.,4
790248,"I first found these in a store and wanted a second pair I loved them so much. They were priced slightly higher on Amazon and it looks like after some feedback on that aspect they have lowered the price since my order. Too bad I missed out on that but I hope to order them again in a smaller size soon! These are super comfy, I walk 4-7 miles in them almost daily!",5
413126,"I purchased this item to wear for Halloween.  It was okay but with a chinstrap to keep it from riding up it would have been perfect. It was not too hot to wear and in fact it rained on Halloween so it was perfect for our pub crawl in the rain! I simply wiped my ears like a kitten each time I came in from the rain.  What was annoying was adjusting the eyeholes when they slipped out of place, making it hard for me to see.",3
349124,"So add me to the list of people who didn't read the size description carefully enough. This clicker is really pretty, but its big. And my nose required the piercing be done on the lower side so it hangs down to my lip. It's also way, way too easy to open - I'm pretty sure it's going to fall out in my sleep. Will probably only wear on occasion.",3
406870,"Bought these to give to all my sisters and sisters-in-law. They feel cheap, but have lasted for a while now. In defense of the item, the design looks like it's not supposed to be a ""heavy duty"" looking necklace, and more of an elegant accessory. All in all, I am happy with the purchase and the girls love them!",4
268742,"Not Joe, Joe's wife! This dress is so pretty and I love the embroidery. Unfortunately it looks awkward on me, as the waist band lies above my boobs. DO NOT BUY if you have a c cup or above. I am a triple D and the upper part of the dress doesn't fit at all. However, I love the dress so I took the string out and will try to make it work.",3
103341,"This blouse has a funny fit.  It looks nice when my arms are down as shown in the picture, but as soon as I raise my arms at all, it hikes up in the bust area 6 inches.  It just won't work.  Too bad too, I thought it was really cute.",2
66647,"After opening I had noticed that they were made of a cheaper plastic then regular tongue rings. I haven't even touched them yet and have already lost about half of them (balls broke). Now I am I fear of touching them, I won't use them, I have no idea what they are made of but I am sure that it is probably unsafe.",1
859047,"I love this romper. I usually don't wear them, but since I lost 45 pounds I decided to order this for a birthday bash I attended. I got lots of compliments on it and it hugged me jus right. I didn't get a chance to take a picture of the whole outfit but here is just a sneak peak. The material is a little thin.",5
533885,"The first time I've ordered clothes off of Amazon and I am disappointed. Horrible fit, horrible fabric quality, bad description of size (medium) was small for a ""medium"".  Ugh. Wish it wasn't a hassle to send back and get a refund. I'll probably never buy clothes on line again! UNLESS I've tried it on in a store and I get a better deal on Amazon. However, I was excited about the jumpsuit and had looked around for one locally.",1
213468,Very cute romper. Great quality material. This was an accidental purchase done by one click shopping but I figured I'd just go with it anyway because of the price. Very short then again I didn't do any measuring as I usually would before buying so I can't complain. Going to give it as a present to one of my short petite friends.,4
575409,"Doesn't keep me warm at +20F.  Neck is too loose, lets cold air in, body heat out.  Feels like there is very little down filling.

People figured I had a whole top set of teeth in because they look so real with my teeth.  they stayed in all night and I was happy to be able to pop them out and back in to eat.  Getting the molding right was initially a challenge, but I had also had a couple of beers. :)",5

The first picture is not what u get I repeat the first picture is NOT WHAT U GET! the second picture u see under first picture IS WHAT U GET! hard to put any charms on ( and yes I bought charms and don't fit, can't get it over the bumps when u unhooking chain) (smh - shaking my head)  and size is smaller than 7.5 in. I DONT  RECOMMEND THIS TO NO ONE. Don't waste ur money wish I didn't.. unhappy customer </3",1

246307,"These are awesome. They're very cheap, but great quality. Some people are sensitive to acrylic, but I've never had any kind of infection or problem. They all came in labeled bags, one pair of tapers and one pair of plugs in each, so it's easy to keep them organised. the only thing is that I wish they came in a box similar to bodfx kits, but the drawstring bag isn't a problem. That's just nitpicking. great product!",5
794159,This is definitely not a cocktail dress as stated in the description. Very thin and short. I wear it around nd the house on very hot days. Great as a beach cover up.  Since its looking older now Im starting to sleep in it. Its  a cozy night dress on hot nights. Definitely not a cocktail dress!!!,1
30214,"You get what you pay for. This product was big enough, but poorly made.  There was no elastic in the waistband to actually keep the tights on my waist. Additionally, the groin area appeared to be cut to accommodate male parts...not sure what was going on with the pouch there. The stripes were cute, so it's a shame.  Would return if I could.",1
312941,"Well, what can I say, these gloves feel very luxurious and soft. They smell very much like expensive leather, and they fit perfectly well. I recently used them to an impromptu ski trip, and these gloves provided ample warmth and comfort, yet they are quite durable as well. The gloves have wool-lining inside of them, so they feel very well when worn. I tend to like wearing them while driving, as they provide heaps of grip when steering.",5

I have had this wallet for over a year, and it still looks great so it is made of good quality. The color however has faded some but it doesn't bother me. Great purchase!",5

558283,"I'm currenty exchanging it because it looks so cute, comfy but the fit was small.  I usually wear a medium and it fit tight, even with zipper adjusted, on the shoulders and tummy area and I wanted the flowy fit as pictured.  I love the concept of the zipper going all the way to shoulder trim, very unique.  I look forward to getting the large and really enjoying the top.  I ordered in yellow and pink.  The yellow is a little lighter than pictured, pink was just right.",4

36678,"I ordered two for Christmas presents for our granddaughter, they loved them! They continued to dance around the Christmas tree with their new ""clear bubble"" umbrellas. They were tickled that the next day it rained even harder, so they could use their new gift from Nana. The adults liked the feature, that the girls were covered by the umbrella, but could see out- for safety. The ""clear"" was a good choice!",5
319970,Love the fit and the color patterns are awesome. I originally bought a pair of amethyst double flared but they wouldn't fit and then I saw I could get a 3 pack for a few bucks more and I was sold! I love the white jade more than I thought I would. I would definitely buy more.,5

I received this item at a discount in exchange of my honest and unbiased review.",4
788433,This bags holds a ton of stuff.  Feels very sturdy and easy to clean.  Only thing I would change is to add an interior pocket of some kind (I added a simple pencil case and this solved the issue however).  The outside pockets are great and hold a bunch of smaller things nicely.  Love the design!,5
425899,This is a great bag.  It has a compartment for PIN Collectors to mount and protect their Pins on the outside (under the flap) of a larger Messanger Bag.  I found it convienent to place Collector supplies (extra backings) and the original Disney backings with UPC in the bag.,5
605604,"I'm petite, would normally order a small or medium, this fits just fine. Be warned there is zero chest support; it's just stretchy leggings-like fabric with a vibrant print. My only small objection is that the print has 2 major feather centers (the dark circles) quite askew on the front, so in the mirror I keep thinking I need to straighten it. The back seems more uniform. As with all cheaply printed clothes like this, you never know exactly how the pattern will land.",4

I can definitely see myself purchasing more stuff from this company/seller.  Thanks, Debra",5

This alone wouldn't be bad, but the silk screening is obviously cheaply done (the white of Raven's face, eyes, and legs aren't done, so the shirt color is what you get for those parts). Disappointed that I wasted this much money on a 'unique' print and waited long for shipping. Buyers, run, don't walk, away.",1
156669,Very nice presentation as shown in picture in nice fitted box.  It will scratch with normal wear but I was surprised for being brand new that there were scratches already on the back of the SS wallet when I took it out of the box.  Cards are a tight fit but that's good as the cars don't easily fall out.  I like the tight solid closing of the unit. Bottom line though well constructed and happy so far with a few days of use.,4

Im quite curvy and have lots of junk in my trunk >.> BUT I got this in my regular size (large) and it fits perfectly its baggy and it easily fits over my butt. IT IS super baggy but I really like it. It's really loose fitting and cute. If you want something a little less baggy I would suggest sizing down.",5
487927,"Soft! Oh my gosh--this dress feels like butterfly wings or non-icky cobwebs or the warmest little breath of air. That was my first thought: Oh wow; this is *soft*! And long! Very, very loooooong! At 5'2"", I have learned to expect to have to hem pretty much everything but this dress, well, the tall girls should be lining up to buy this thing! It'll be a wonderful casual-wear dress for summer.",5

The torso was so short that I will not let her wear it as 1 wrong move and Chi Chi's are coming out. I would order a size up for your little ones.,2

The pajama set appears to fit as expected, though my son is on the smaller side for his age. The colors did not bleed when I washed the set the first time. I definitely recommend these pajamas for the summer months.

I received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest review.",5
138809,"These are okay for the price. They're a good color and decently opaque, but they're not very elastic. They sort of stretch out while wearing them and then bunch around the ankles a bit. If I was taller maybe this wouldn't happen, but I still think they could be tighter/stretchier, like some higher-quality tights. Not my favorite, but I haven't put a run in them yet so that's a plus.",3
45478,This is my 2nd purchase of these. I am in love with these. I can make a ring I wear on my ring finger into a pinkie ring. These are wonderful. I cannot say enough about them. If your rings are loose as mine are since I've lost 197 lbs then you really need to get these. I have a lot of rings that are way to big for me and it would cost a lot to resize all of them. This is the best solution in all the world.,5

I'm close to 5'8 and weigh approximately 155 and I ordered an XL. If I was to order this skirt again, I would go with a medium. I think large would still be too big lol that's why I only gave it 4 stars.",4

The seller was more than willing to send replacement but when I sent him a photo of what I received he said that is how they are made.

Shirt style is exactly as shown, does look like someone in home ec class could have sewn it but that's the look. I liked the sleeves and color is good.

The lining across the back is too small and is sewn incorrectly, there's no top stitching to hold it in place and it flips out and hangs outside the dress.  The sleeves are too tight under the arms and the cuffs are sews tightly, almost giving the dress puffed sleeves.",2
299945,"A bit odd...I thought it would fit like a duster, but it's more like an accessory/vest-type garment.  Doesn't come together in front, so it's not a ""cover-up"" (like to go out & get the newspaper in...no)  It's going to look good over a dress I have, but it's not what I expected to get.  Maybe it's not too small for what they meant it to be..(?)  But it won't close/cover in front.",3

Thank you for listening and your time!

816649,They are cute but not as cute as I'd hoped. They slide out from under her feet to where she's walking on the tasseled moccasin decoration with the soles pointed out each direction no matter what sandal I use and regardless of sock so I rated 4 since they still aren't quite right! :\,4
412827,This bag is everything I hoped it would be and more.  There are so many pockets it's wonderful.  I have an 18 month old son and I hate still carrying a diaper bag so this doubles has a purse and diaper bag for me.  I knew when I put it on my wish list that it was a larger bag because it was described has a hobo bag which do tend to be larger.  I'm beyond satisfied with this bag and have gotten lots of compliments on it already.,5

I liked that they came in several color options and am impressed with how well they block out the sun. Would recommend.",5

The feel was a bit awkward at first, as is usual with any new ring but now I can't even tell I'm wearing it. The day after I received these rings, I had to make a trip to the jeweler. Right away the jeweler commented, ""What a beautiful ring."" She didn't realize at first that it was sterling silver and cubic zirconia's. I recommend this ring for sure. It's stunning!",5
49689,This product didn't really do much for me and I gave up on it after a few weeks. It became loose after a couple weeks and absolutely cannot be worn under clothes discretely. It's perfectly acceptable for wearing around the house. I feel like it didn't really do much to help me after my c-section.,3
231601,"First pair of ""expensive"" underwear. I will steadily try other brands, but to kick it off, SAXX underwear is awesome! The waistband is not noticeable, the fabric feels great. I would preferably pair them with dress slacks, yet I played basketball with them and no issue. Very breathable. My girlfriend loves my butt in these. Great purchase!",5
789571,"Customer service was excellent when I received a defective pair. However, if you're wanting food, quality leggings for intense workouts, these are not up to par.  I bought the black and white.  The squat test didn't pass on the first, defective-pair I received but did pass on the pair they resent me.  They are not as tight as I'd like and don't hold you in.  For reference I am 123#, 5'3"" and I ordered the small...a little big.  I'll wear them for running or less intense workouts.  Very cute!",4

After reading another mom's review on a diaper that did NOT have the side snaps like this one does, I was determined to order one with the snaps. It's soooooo much easier to get on and off, and if you do have a #2, you won't end up with it smeared all down his/her legs. I will never buy a different kind of swim diaper.",5

I ordered a size 7.5 and it is a little loose. I went and got my size checked before ordering, and I'm a 7.5. I recommend this ring if scratches don't bother you.",3
784809,"Don't be fooled by the description.  We bought this four pack of super hero socks for my daughter who wears a size 61/2 ladies shoe, and they fit perfectly.  They are real nice and long on her.  They came right up to her knee (she is 5 ft tall).  They are a nice quality sock and super fun!",5
702863,Dress is very cute but extremely tight in the bust (I'm a size 38d) and also too tight in the arms. I ordered an XL which usually fits fine but this dress was a bit tight and too short. I put a lace slip with it and that helped but the arms were not comfy. I gave it to my size 6 daughter and she put a belt with it and loved it!,3
250819,This was my first cinched purchase and I absolutely love it. After recently having a baby this held my little pudgy in perfectly and gave me a nice shape.  I am 5'3 and 140 lbs. Fit a little long but you will sit up straight the entire time it's on,5
111361,"Looks nice -I got the green with yellow icons, size 2XL. However, BEWARE: this shirt fits way too small. A 2XL normally fits big on me. Not this one. I fret at the thought of putting it in the dryer. I wish I would've gotten a bigger size. Yet, 2XL was the biggest they had in this color. Order BIG if you're gonna order!",3
242142,My wedding ring is tungsten carbide but after losing weight it no longer fit so I ordered this one. I ordered a size 10.5 but probably will need a 10 soon but its very simple and really nice. Its comfort fit so as the name implies it is really comfortable to wear. Totally worth buying at this price.,5
754864,"Ordered this dress for my daughter.  She didn't even get to try it on because it was damaged.  Received dress with holes/runs through the yarn. Although the price is very cheap, it definitely doesn't look like the quality of the one advertised.  Also the color is different.  Very see through. Would have to be worn with a layer underneath. Disappointed",1
162137,They look and fit how I wanted. I have a cartilage piercing at the top of my ear and they're small enough to fit snugly and not dangle. The ball bearing wasn't really that hard to get in for me compared to what some people said. It's as difficult as any ball bearing hoop.,5
95884,This is exactly what I was hoping it would be. Very well made for the money. It did shed at first but I shook it real good and had no issues after that - I got tons of complements on it. The color is a nice almost burgundy red which I prefer over bright red - the material has some spandex feel to it making it very comfortable and I have worn the boot covers several times this season tucked into my boots for a furry boot sock look. You won't find another Mrs Clause nicer at this price point.,5
793215,Good bottles for the most part but one of them had some defects and I had to get rid of it because it was not screwing on properly and would come off when I was trying to fix them for my kids. I would purchase them again and hope that this time all the bottles would be correct.,4

So glad I went by other reviews & purchased from here!",5

100519,"This is actually a really nice quality scarf for the price.  It does not appear to fray easily, and the tag came off without ripping a hole in the scarf.  Chiffon usually gets runs in it depending on how its tied as a scarf, and I tried a few knots with not a single run.  I like the sapphire blue but will probably buy other colors in the future.",5

If I could have made it work I would have tailored it to make it completely reversible and worn it backwards.",2
641121,"I'm normally a medium and I ordered an extra large after reading the reviews. I usually wear a 4-6 in pants and the skirt fits fine. I will have to take in the waist, I have it clipped in the back for the photo. I like the top but had to but a bralette under in because it is too narrow and doesn't have enough coverage (I'm a 34b). Overall, just order two sizes up. On a side note the fabric is not the most flattering if you're trying to cover up some trouble areas.",3

Pros - price is excellent, it arrived quickly, love the clear display for 3 slots of cards, feels great, looks good, and I like that the bottom is open so charging is easier because phone  doesn't need to be removed from case.
Cons - the part that holds the phone is only sides so it's not a secure hold, the magnet doesn't hold it closed so when I close the cover it doesn't cover the phone",4

152576,"Yeah! I received my earrings today and I LOVE them.  I decided to send this pair to a friend as a surprise and I am going to order another couple of pairs. They look just like the picture, but look closely at where the back of the earring and the stud end: they're pretty close together.  Even though it looked like they'd be too small, I had no problem getting them on (and they looked great on).  They took a while to get here but were definitely worth the wait!",4
775415,"First off, this shirt is really cute. I don't regret buying it. However, this runs at least a size and a half small, I purchased a 2T thinking I could save it for my growing boy, and it fits more like a small-fitting 18mo size. He'll possibly get a few months out of it. Secondly, when I washed it in cold water inside out, some of the red color ran into the white part of the shirt. Otherwise ok.",3
219737,"The material is nice and soft, and the color is rich, however, the XS, which is the size I almost always wear, was too small, not like the one the model is wearing. I would not recommend the XS except for a child, in order to get the right fit.",4
62358,This was a great product intended to be used for the purpose of healing from hysterectomy surgery.  The product was great but just way to tight with the size selected based on the size chart.  I loved it but realized that it would not work well for me so I sent it back.,5

DO NOT BUY. Just so horriblle",1

However, I do recommend these jeans, and look just like a pair of slacks and I have worn them to work with nice blouse and no one even guesses they are Pajama-jeans.",5
409397,this is absolutely amazing. fits so comfortable and gives your but a perfect lift. The opening is just  a tad bit small but thats not a major issue.for me.  i am 5'7 177 pounds and i bought a medium. class D. LOVE IT!!!  onky gave it 4 stars becasue of the opening. other than that i would give 5 stars.,4

138433,"Though they don't strike me as over-sized in the least, the size of these sunglasses are perfect for me. Anyone thinking of ordering these would do well to check the measurements in the description beforehand. These glasses are in no way SUPER dark, either. But! As an avid, sneaky people watcher, they serve their purpose. The lenses are dark and shiny enough that when they catch a stranger's eye, all they see is their own reflection. The glasses even came with their own little drawstring pouch.

Overall, I am pleased.",4

I was worried about the quality and size of these metal charms(?) but we went ahead and ordered them.  They were packaged nicely in thier box with detailed foam cut outs for each piece.  The metal is bright gold and feels heavy.  My son was thrilled and carried them around everywhere we went, and showed them off to all his friends. We were pleased with the purchase.",5

Where the material is gripped by the metal linking chain the fabric is coming out of the sides a little bit, but for the price it's not bad at all.

Even though the arms are very short, and the pockets are practically towards your backsides, I really enjoy wearing this around the house and for sleep.  I ordered 2 more in XL.  I really wish these came in more colors.",4
622246,I ordered up a size and it fit as expected. I got tons of compliments on the dress while working a trade show where l needed to have a classic pin up appearance to my attire. The fabric is nice and thick which is great for fall or early spring. The only thing I didn't like was the bottoms on the collar. They were snap buttons but did not snap on to the dress so the collar needs to be ironed flat. I currently have someone applying mates to the snaps so the collar stays down.,4

I tend to use only one bag so need to have it meet all settings.  The strap is somewhat old-fashioned but works fine.  The organizer section could use more card space.  However, I am very pleased with the handbag!",4

778152,"The seller is friendly- so I am not rating this a 3 based on that. I do not consider myself to have a long torso- I'm pretty proportionate- however- this swim suit did not fit at all. I stepped into it, and the suit did not go from crotch to neck- it ended just under my breasts. So I could not even pull the straps up. I am 5'5""- so not a tall person at all :) Just an FYI for buyers....",3
134164,This dress is really cute but it fits waaay to tight in the chest area and I have small breast. I would order it two sizes larger than I did just for it to fit right up top. I had the top portion removed and I just wear the bottom as a skirt because I like how the material flows.,4

I wear a size 38 DDD in bra. This hoodie is super small. I expected better. Maybe it is a knock off. I usually buy Polo from macys and have not had this problem,2

I'm 5'3"" and 120 lbs, petite/athletic build, and the small fits like a glove.",4
241537,"Be careful about the sizing. I ordered the exact same size as my other ring, but this one feels like it's bigger and slips out easier because the edges are bevelled on the inside as well as the outside, thus effectively making it slightly larger. I had to return it. But it was a BEAUTIFUL ring!",5

She like the different pockets. I think this one could have lasted her a whole school yr if we would have bought it first.,5
115782,"I ordered an XL because I wanted a loose shirt. I received a L instead. Normally a large shirt as described in the size chart would fit but this was too small. I ended up giving it to my daughter who wears a medium in juniors. For the price of the shirt, it was not worth paying the shipping charges to send it back. I don't think I will order from this company again.
Disappointed!",2

879664,"Love this shirt!! I wear a large, but ordered a medium  because I read one of the reviews that stated it ran big...it does not!  All the other southern T-shirts do run large because they're technically men T-shirts. This one is definitely a ladies long sleeve T-shirt.

But its highly adjustable,  I'm a size 40 waist you might have trouble if you're bigger than 44 but it's hard to say. The buckle is perfect. I do wish that the band that strapped around the gun was long enough to fit around the gun. I think if they used a brown elastic strap this would fix the issue and be tight fitting to the gun. Might replace it later but it's ok for now",4

I wear it every day while walking.",5

I just would've loved for it to have come in a larger size.",3

Would buy more for sure and recommend anyone to buy this. Just make sure they send the right color. :D",4

565823,"Well, it looks good but the functionality is lacking, there is virtually no padding or reinforcement in the mask so not only does it slide around it is very uncomfortable in places, over your nose for example. The lights are a nice touch but it would be nice if they could point forward instead of at your feet. I will add some foam to the inside and see how that works.",3
46049,"I bought this for a Ginger Spice Girls costume. I'm 5'2"" active/fit. The dress fits great around my waist and shoulders and is not too cleavage baring. However, this is barley a dress. It just barley covers my butt, and I have to pull it down to do so. I know Ginger Spice is known for short dresses, but I'm not a pop star haha If you purchase, plan on wearing leggings / pants with it! Or get a bigger size if you don't mind the waist being big.",3
51058,This product didn't really do much for me and I gave up on it after a few weeks. It became loose after a couple weeks and absolutely cannot be worn under clothes discretely. It's perfectly acceptable for wearing around the house. I feel like it didn't really do much to help me after my c-section.,3
243816,"I was surprised at how these fit.  I didn't read all the reviews, but several women said they ran huge.  So with that in mind I ordered the size I normally wear and I could get them on, but I looked like I was poured into them.  They were super small.  I would suggest getting a whole size larger than what you formally wear, that is, if you want them to look like the picture.",1
58263,Do not buy these. I repeat DO NOT BUY THESE they took twice as expected to come and when they finally arrived they were bent and shoved into a box half their size and scuffed to high heaven..very displeased. I hope this can save others from the displeasure and disappointment.,1
106372,"I bought these for my little girl's Halloween costume.. And in the products defense, my child is very tall for her age so I was prepared for them to be too short.. (which is fine that they were!) But when they were as tight as they were I was surprised because she has very thin legs. For future buyers - keep in mind that if your little one has those cute chubby baby legs, these warmers are probably not for them.",3
23294,"Very pleased. Easy to use. Didn't stretch my boots as much as I'd like, but I think that is more an issue with the leather and size descrepancy, not the stretcher. My shoes came out great. Just be realistic about how much you can stretch a piece of leather, and don't expect miracles, overall, very pleased.",5
642849,These tank tops are great.  I have gotten several colors. They wear well and keep their shape throughout the day. They are long but I like that I can pull it down or bunch it up under a top. They are great for layering.  The material is SO soft and smooth!  They are a tad pricey but I've been able to get mine with a coupon or special deal and I've found they are worth it. The navy is my favorite!!,5
459824,"I love this belt.. Well made, right size, beautiful color, good price.. The only bad thing was that after wearing it the first time fora few hours, a little of the red paint had flecked off around the buckle.  I would order it again though because it was not expensive and a really sharp belt!",4
552594,"Size M? On what planet? Seriously? I am a size 4 and thought this size ""M"" (ha!) dress would fit. But I have only myself to blame for not doing the math and translating those pesky centimeter measurements into inches. This is NOT a medium. It is an extra small. Why is that ""M"" in the title of this item? Apparently, because it is ""misleading.""",1
292648,"I have worn Fruit of the Loom happily for years, but these boxers are at least a size too small. In the picture below, you can see that the red pair which are also Fruit of the Loom 2XL, that I bought from Target are an inch longer on both sides. They're also very thin material.
Don't waste your money.",1
127780,"I really loved the idea, but I am well-endowed chica and the costume is just about see-through in the right/all light. Won't return because the length is perfect and the only see through parts are my ""T and A"", but any other chicas with a little more bust or booty might want to go a size up, which is disappointing because the stomach part doesn't even lie flat on me. I will probably fix by just wearing something with more coverage underneath, but still a little disappointing.",3
441962,"These stockings are very cute, comfy, and much more durable than I expected for the price. They are a bit short, though... I'm average/slender at 5'5"" and they go only a little past my knees. Too short to use with garter belts. It's fine, though, because they stay up fairly well on their own (and without the silicone strips on others--those annoy me and usually fall down anyways). These have just an elastic band at the top.",4
296800,"Super cute shoe however runs wide and big, I'm a size 10 however this size 10 is too big. I went to a sporting goods store and tried the same shoe on  turns out with this particular shoe I'm a 9.5, so order half the size u normally are.",3
155710,Nice snazzy case. Has held up longer than any of the other brands I've tried. Also doubles as a pocket mirror intil it becomes covered in scratches. Can old a few bills in a card pocket if folded a certain way (think along the lines of a letter). Almost two years later some of the pockets are starting to tear on the edges.,4
408905,"The quality of the product its nice; but I believe the sizes are off. I bought the extra small size for my 2yrs old son (this supposed to be for 2-4yrs old toddlers), and it didn't fit at all,  the tshirt was too big on him.  I ended up,  fixing it myself.",3
460526,"They accidentally sent a size larger than I ordered, but I was surprised to get a full refund when I notified them of this. Other than that, it was a really nice jacket. The quality was better than expected & it was really warm for the snowy season. Not too mention--totally adorable. I got compliments all the time",4
614404,"LOVE THEM!! They are exactly like the picture. I am 5'6, 130 (muscular built), and ordered a small. They fit perfectly. The only small complaint i have is that the front of the bikini bottom has a little more fabric than i had hoped. That's just a personal preference though! I can't wait to wear them on the 4th of July :))",5
241840,"Great looking ring! I had a regular Tungsten Carbide ring and paid about $200 at a jeweler. This White Tungsten Carbide has a more silver/platinum look to it. Price is great and has a comfortable feel to it.

Size is spot on. Remember this is a comfort fit so it does have a looser feel than a flat shaped ring.",5
15274,"I have been struggling with a foot problem for a couple of years now, self diagnosed metatarsalgia. I could only run or walk for about 30 minutes before I had pain in the ball of my left foot.  I tried another brand of insoles (don't recall the brand) that didn't help at all. Finally, after a bit of research I came across a recommendation for Powerstep. Once they arrived, I put them in my running shoes, felt relief almost immediately, and have had crazy happy feet ever since.",5
787941,"Great sweater! It's soft and comfortable, and the burgundy is a rich, beautiful color. Does run a little bit small though--so it's one of those sweaters I'll always wear open over a really cute shirt--but I still love it. I would love to buy another one in a different color! :)",5
324202,"These cruise tags were exactly what I wanted and reasonably priced, too. I was specifically looking for the loop attachments which I feel are safer but harder to find. Shipping was fast and I can't wait to use them soon. Looking forward to the bonus luggage tags, also. I recommend Sharkskinzz as a seller and am pleased with their service.",5
407869,"I love the Pleaser line of pumps!  I always know what size to order and they are quite reasonably priced.
They run true to size so if you sometimes need a size 5 in a pump you can definitely get away with a 6.
They run on the smaller side.
I love this line of shoes-great fit great look, great price!",5

450073,"I don't know if the product page was updated, or not, but the dress is exactly what you see in the pictures. The contrasting side seam and ties are, clearly, shown. It's what I liked about this dress and wouldn't have bought it otherwise.
Taste aside, it fits great. The measurements provided are accurate. As a bonus there's no tags sewn in and the way it's cut allows it to be worn slanting in either direction.",5
162560,Poor product! The reason I throw these away is they were painted all surfaces including tips which goes into my skin too. I doubt  they used good quality paint on the chip looking earrings means it has lead which is toxic in your body. Besides that the product is terribly tacky. You could recognize right away that it is painted and glued the piece of pearl. These are the worst product I have ever purchased from forien country. DON'T BUY THESE!!!!!!,1
444085,Exactly as pictured. Well made pretty colored good quality fluffy fur material. I especially like the grey brown fur in the 'koala' I ordered. I'm planning on wearing it to take my kids trick or treating with a Mama Bear sweatshirt. I love the zipper pocket in one of the scarf sides too. Perfect for my iphone. Great product and for $13 it was a great deal!,5
94280,"Purchased xs size; looked bigger than what it was indicated in the size chart when I tried on. So, I had contacted with customer service, they responded quickly. They suggested to keep this item with 30% of money refund. They were nice offering a partial money back with a good  suggestion that make this outfit as a gift for my friend. Overall, it looked okay and customer care was good, but you have to consider about the size before you purchase.",3
802969,"Looks WAY better than the picture, so that's a plus! The pendant can slide off of the chain, which could be useful for putting it on another chain, or bad because of it falling off...

681,"I couldn't wear these out or under anything because they're enormous. The only place you can wear them will be to bed, and even then you'll look silly. I wish I could return them, but I tried shrinking them and that didn't work - avoid, unless you're big and tall... These should be marked Big and tall - CK used to make a great fitting shirt, but this is not it!",1

854038,"Love the grey/blue together but it's very heavy feeling bc of the length.  Also the material will show sweat so definitely will not be wearing in the summer.  Also, it will short painty lines and every pudge in the tummy, hips and rear areas.  Will shorten the skirt part to above the knee and wear it in the fall with a high waste slimmer underneath.",3
767043,"Terrible material.  White is see through. There is a seam, yes SEAM around the elbow area of each arm.  Why the heck is there a seam there? Not seen in the picture and not in the description.  Not returning it because I took the tag off prematurely and now figure I can wear it to bed or a rag to clean the house.  Avoid.",1

353343,"Great, strong, and very durable leather laces! I'm currently using part of mine for a new leg tiedown for my 45. Long colt pistol holster. Works amazingly well.

648498,I am 5'2 and prepregnancy was 130 lbs.  I ordered a size 12 and it was perfect.  A little snug up top in the arms but nothing uncomfortable.  Its a thin dress but seeing as it was needed in Florida durring warms months I am thankful for that! Over all I love the dress and would order again!,4
105701,"advertised as leggings - as other users said - these are not leggings, they are tights. 100% polyester hot feeling fabric, smells like plastic. as tights, they are awesome. sadly, i was trying to buy leggings.  im 5'6, size 10-12 ordered a size medium, fits nice through the legs and rear, not too transparent, but the torso goes up to my bra line. yuck. will keep them around for winter vortex days as long johns, but other than that these are pretty useless. guess i need to read before i purchase stuff on amazon :/",2
54042,"Very happy with this purchase. Great quality. My daughter is 12 months so I got the 6-18 month size. Its slightly big, but it ties around the neck and also can adjust around the head making it fit perfectly and stay on her. She should be able to wear this hat for this season and next.",5
544257,"After a year, this wallet still looks very nice. The leather was worn down and smoothed out, and it's also become much darker, so it looks like a different wallet, but still looks nice. The only failure I've noticed is that the right card pockets seam has come loose, so they now poke out into the middle of the wallet, but it doesn't really affect use.",4
485861,"This jacket is very roomy, and very sleek. There's a bit of cloth material in the front of it, that's gives it such a more expensive look. Great zippers, that so far has not gotten stuck once. Light weight,  not heavy. It would be very comfortable to tote, if you needed to.
If you're looking for an affordable jacket, yet with a designer look. Purchase this jacket!",5
706837,I washed it in hot to get it to shrink just a tiny bit and it's perfect. I like the distressed look of the print. It's great to find cool Sci Fi shirts for someone my size. It's always fun when someone asks me what it's for? Even more fun when someone sees it and actually knows what Hadley's Hope is.,5

I have another pair of the same brand, purchased at the same time, which seem okay, but I much prefer compression socks made by Nurse Mates or Celeste Stein Designs.  Both of those brands are more comfortable, more durable, and are made in the USA.",1
78032,"Very solid band for a watch. Right now I am using it for my Luminox 3001 model and it really is an eye catching watch. I guess the only down side is the price. $22.00 is a lot for a nylon band, but overall I am very pleased with the quality",4
24271,"They are excellant! The best I have ever worn!  They cut through the haze & mist on cloudy days, and the glare on sunny days.  They do not cut the glare of headlights at night as well as ""blue blockers"", which are the best for night driving. These completely block the blue and violet segments of the visible light spectrum.",5
357929,I don't usually do this but I had too this by far has  to be the best booty lifter I purchases. I had aa few booty lifters and what I like about this the most it is comfortable around the thigh and under the buttocks. The lace allow it your skin to breath and not Sig in your skin. Another thing I like is the stomach and smoothing the back fat. It stays up and don't roll down. Overall for the price ....this is a well made booty lifter. ,5
688409,"It's beautiful with quality material... problem is the fit... I ordered a size 12 even though I wear a size 8 (USA). The dimentions mentioned in the size chart were even an inch larger than my size.  When it arrived, it was very small- around 3.5 inches off on the chest and 2.5 inches off on the waist.  So I can't wear it. I will probably just donate it.  I ordered express shipping so it would make it in time for an event.  I would have worn it if it fit. =(",4
423874,"Feels and looks cheap. The links are very poorly finished. They don't connect seamlessly closed. Instead there is a 2-4mm gap in every link causing the chain to lay horribly. If you close the gap with some pliers, it makes the link misshapen.  This looks like poorly made hardware store chain.",2
544299,"I am a senior female and I purchased this waist pack for my self. I LOVE it!!! Well made, with Brass zippers and buckle, very attractive. I needed a pack that would fit my Beretta PX4 Storm Compact 9mm, and there is plenty of room in main compartment. That leaves 3 other pockets for I.D., money and personal items. The belt is adjustable  and comfortable. I like to wear a little lower on the abdomen and this pack works beautifully.",5

399457,I bought this bag for myself because I needed a summer bag. Everywhere I go people compliment me on my bag and ask me where I purchased it.  I have always loved Stone Mountain handbags whether they are leather or fabric. This bag is very roomy and not large or too small. I would recommend this bag to anyone who needs a handbag.,5
380809,I really love these things and Ive had them for six days now. The only reason why I took one star off is because at 6 days my daisies stopped sticking on the edges making it not so seamless. The middle is still very sticky so thats okay but I take very good care of them and wash them after every use and even put the plastic film on them. So Im not sure why its not adhering but I love these things and was hoping it wouldnt lose its stickiness so soon :-//,4
41955,I would recommend this haqndbag to anyone who needs their purse to be organized.  I absolutely love this handbag and am hoping to find more like it.  The price was extremely reasonable for a leather purse.  It is very well made and it is not only extremely functional but also very stylish.,5
425958,"Pretty color but it came in too large.  I ordered a medium, which is what I wear normally, and it definitely fits like a large.  The sleeves are too wide as well, they almost cover the crown of my shoulders.  Definitely not what is seen in the picture.",3

304041,"Not sure if it's the style or if I received a defective set, but they fit as expected until you wore it for a few minutes and then the zippers popped open.  Also, the zipper cover at the top is a great idea except it's so bulky it pokes through your shirts, so you have a weird bump on your chest.  Otherwise, loved them.  Nice and tight, would have been supportive.",3
22715,I bought this for my three month old son and it works well!  Not too huge and the adjustable tab works well. It should fit him for a while. Nice soft material. I can see why some people complain about the hard tab in the back but it doesn't seem to bother my son at all.,5
150889,I ordered a small and the size is way too big. It look like a large at the least. I tried it on and can tell that it can be cute but it goes way past my knees and is loose. The sleeves are also way too big. I'm 5'1. 120 pounds and very athletic.,1
460353,I almost didn't order this top because a lot of the reviews stated that it was too small.  I'm glad I ordered it in a extra large and it fits perfect.  I'm a size medium and went two sizes bigger.  Too my surprise it fits beautifully and the layered look is as it shows.,5
159782,"I just got my scarf yesterday; 4 days before it's first expected delivery date. I'm very happy with the length and softness of this scarf. I wore it the same day I got it and it was very comfortable and light weight. It was certainly a good buy. My only complaints would be that was a little thinner than I was expecting and that it had a few loose strings. Overall, it's a very nice scarf and I will be wearing it a lot this winter! I hope to buy more like these in the future. :)",4

568972,Best hat ever! I would like to have one in ten colors. Will buy again. Adjustable band helps size it. Color is so true. Well made. Good quality hat. Haven't tried washing it yet. I prefer the shorter bill on the cadet hat as opposed to the traditional baseball cap.,5
175005,"Fantastic short coat for spring and summer!  I read the reviews, and ordered a size up (I am tall, and usually wear a small.)  When I took the coat out of its packaging, it looked quite narrow across the shoulders, but it fits perfectly. As I'm tall, the length is between hip and knee,
which is perfect for warmer weather.  Has a pleasant, silky feel and, for the price, it is great-looking; it will look terrific worn over pants, skirts, dresses. Very pleased with it!",5
542562,"I really wish this seller had better quality clothes because they look very cute on.  However, I bought 3 of these dresses (including one jumper) and all of them did not make it past the first wash and some not even to the wash.  The straps break off (which isn't great when you're in public) and the seam in the cleavage splits- I took it to a tailor and they said that the material is so cheap they can't fix it.",1
431273,"I get lots of compliments on it, but it only has print on one side and I always have to wear a sweater with it since it does not let you wear a bra otherwise. I bought it as a trial before I bought an expensive one as a bridesmaid dress and I'm so glad I did.",3
181259,"Beautiful kilt.  Fits perfect and is very comfy!  Nice heavy weight and the pleats are crisp and there are a lot of them.  Far, far better quality than the cheaper kilts on Amazon.  Great quality, but make sure you measure correctly.  Love, love, love this kilt.",5
409442,I liked the shoe but I noticed that while walking if you're not careful the hooks on the shoes can connect and can trip you up in the streets lol. Happened to me too many times. I just had to give them away even though I didn't want to. They fit perfectly. True to to size,4
574414,"The light blue in the picture is more of an illusion, it is a shinier material so it looks lighter but in person it looks darker.  It is very rigid which can go either way.  I like my pocket squares softer and flexible but this would be good for a standard square fold.  For the price, it isn't bad but you are getting exactly what you pay for.",2
665539,"It's a cute shirt, however, it runs very small.  Be aware there is absolutely no stretch across the chest.  Normally a size medium fits me perfectly, but in this shirt I probably need a XL.  Also, I sent a request to return the item and have not heard back from them.",2
788171,"This is a horrible item. It was way to big, I ordered according to the size charge and you could fit three of me it in. Plus it is very very see through. I could probably wear it as a dress if I wanted everyone and there brother to know what type of panties I had on. It's a waste to try and get a refund because you have to pay shipping, which is probably more than the item cost to begin with. BEWARE PEOPLE... This garment is crap.",1

I know it is a little flimsy but I hope this lasts for years. It came sooner than I expected. I placed the order last week and Amazon told me it would ship in August. Mine came with some short, green hairs stuck in the hinge and with an imperfection on the inside, but it's fine once I have a photo put in there to cover it.",5
300300,"Bought this ring for a trip where we were going to be swimming or sitting on the beach all day long for a week.  It worked great in the water and sand even with my sensitive skin.  My wife, on the other hand, got one of those other different popular brands that made her skin start flaking and peeling away.",5
651262,"I bought this for myself as hubby and I ride our bike all year long, weather permitting. This shirt is an excellent addition to the layers that I wear under my jacket when we ride in cooler weather. Make sure that you order it a bit larger, as per the sellers request.  Please note, I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and un-biased review",5
430932,"The design is very cute, and the cover is furry. The layout of this wallet is very convenient since bills and cards can be obtained without unzipping the wallet. Additionally, coins can be kept in a zippered compartment which is quite useful. One characteristic that prevents this wallet, in my opinion, from achieving five stars is that it may be a little thick in width when all your cards, bills, and coins are in there. Other than that,  I think this wallet is cute and useful.
The order was shipped and delivered very promptly.",4
852614,"Great price and prompt shipping. Once these are broken in a little, I see them being super comfortable to wear to work (I work at a law firm and sometimes walk down the block for lunch). You can't really beat the price and the quality looks very solid (again, particularly for the price!). I'm buying these as my wedding shoes, but I'd buy another pair in a different color and wear them all day e'ry day.",5
265234,"Very soft material, fits great on the length, though a little baggy.  The downside of these pjs is that they do not have the strap that goes across the zipper, making it easy for my toddler to unzipper.  I won't take any stars off for that since I bought it knowing that it didn't have that feature.",5
176834,"I wasn't expecting much given the price, but I figured I wouldn't be out much if I didn't like them.  I was pleasantly surprised!  These earrings seem to be well made.  They are solid (without being too heavy) and I have gotten compliments on them every time I've worn them.  No jewels have fallen out like another poster commented.  I've had them for several months without a problem.",5
709932,"It's really, really comfy. 'Will need to be dry cleaned to make it last. I wouldn't put it in a washing machine without expecting to just get a pile of cotton thread back, but the unique factor outweighs that little pain in the butt. I also find the hands to be cut a little long, but they can just be rolled under. Am probably going to order one in white too. It's just the right weight for FL winter.",5

591127,"Very cute outfit, however, the pink jacket is way too small compared to the rest of the outfit.  The shirt and skirt fit fine but the pink jacket was like 2 sizes too small.  Also, the picture shows 3 pearl like beads on the navy blue bow on the skirt...mine was missing this which was disappointing because what I liked about the outfit was its detail and mine was missing this.  Overall, rather disappointed, but my 2 year old niece loved it.",3
448635,"The shirt arrived on time and as described.  I really like the design and the shirt itself appears to be well made.  When I buy t-shirts on-line, I tend to buy them a size or 2 larger in case they shrink after washing them.  In this case, I'm happy to say the shirt has not shrunk at all.  I recommend this shirt.",5

454164,"These socks are super cute.  The superhero design is perfect for my daughter, who loves superheroes and mismatching her socks.  The mismatching drives me nuts, so at least with these, they are relatively close.  Seem to be good quality.  Have washed them a few times now and have held up very well.",5
480603,"This scarf is perfect! It is prettier in person than in the picture and it is really long. When it arrived it did have a bit of a smell to it, but I washed it on delicate and dried it and the smell is completely gone. I would highly recommend this scarf, especially for the price.",5
415464,"These earrings are cute, but just a little big for my taste (12mm is max for me), is probably a 16-17mm.  If you like the earring to surpass your ear, then this earring is probably for you.  I decided to keep it anyway, just in case I ever need a little bigger studs.",3

The only issues I saw with them was the inside showed wear very quickly and I could see where they rubbed against each other.

I received this item at a discount for a fair and honest review.",4

Overall an okay purchase but not 5 stars.",4

276710,"For the price of this item, I was expecting something that was more, tacky and cheaply made, but to my surprise, I was sent a very nice pair of sunglasses. For my head, they fit perfectly and the base seemed decently durable. This was exactly what I was looking for because it not only fit within a good price range but had very good quality. Lastly, the only issue I noticed with this product was a very slight un-balancedness. However, this was very hard to notice.",4
36268,"It was ripped in a few places...I believe from shipping.  It was also dirty...there was a layer of dusty dirt all over it.  I didn't even bother opening it, so I can't vouch for the durability.  Although, I tend to think that if it was THAT damaged from shipping (box was fine, but there was a box of legos in the box with the umbrella) then it's not a very durable item.",1

I think I could have possibly gone one size down, but the fit is still great and it doesn't look big on me.  For reference, I'm 5'6"", 116 lbs., and 34"" at the bust.

Instead of buying another gold ring. I bought this titanium ring. It looks so good I cannot tell the difference. But what a difference in cost. The size 6
was a bit too loose. So I bought a size smaller from the same seller Metals Jewelry and it fits perfectly. The cost did not even put a dent in pocket.
What a great buy! My wife loves it too!",5

It made it just in time for Mother's Day too! :-)  would highly recommend this necklace!",5

I am very fit and most boots are loose at the ankle and too tight on the calves but these hug the lines of my legs perfectly.  They look really great.  Only warning I have that these will make you sweat like crazy.  I am a dancer and I was sweating like a pig after three hours and had to change out of them.,5

The only thing that was different then what I expected was the material it's more like jersey material and the lace is not the scratchy kind.  It's lightweight and very comfortable.

Perfect in length as I am a tall girl. 5ft 8 and 185 lbs. . the only thing I did not like about the dress is the fact that it is a bit roomy n the stomach area. but that can easily be fixed. I may try a large in a different color and see how it fits. but overall great Jumper love it and great price.",5

54183,"I bought this hat for my then 3 1/2 month old daughter.  I have been using it all the time to shield her from the strong L.A. sun.  It's adorable on her and I love how wide the brim is.  It's big enough to have room to grow into.  For those babies with small heads, it might be a little too big to wear until they're a little bit older (5 MO+).",5
163572,"I've been frustrated with T-shirts the past decade or so. They've gotten thin and insubstantial as manufacturers have cut costs (I assume...).

It is adjustable in the back with wellcro, it doesn't flop, pretty stable around the face, half the head is covered, you can take hair out or keep it in! If you need  the whole head covered, it's not for you. Perfect for face  to stay in shade!!! I love it! And you have a free return option!!!!",5

288822,"I love these socks. I bought them for myself, then for two of my friends as gifts because they liked them so much.  The quality is great- colors are vibrant, the material is strong and stretchable, and after almost a year of wearing and washing these they look just as they did when I bought them. The price really doesnt match the quality- I would normally have expected socks like these to be so much more expensive!!  Much love!!",5
177858,Very cute shorts. The description said a size 3/4 was the appropriate size Small but unfortunately these could have fit an 8 year old. I would have needed to order an XL size.

Then I put my feet up on an ottoman, and the shedding began - a blizzard of black fuzz that stuck to the upholstery. I washed them and now they shed white fuzz along with the black. I guess they'll stop shedding at some point in the future, but I'm very unhappy with this product and won't order it again.",1
134513,"These are super comfy and just the right size. The waist comes up high enough not to show the elastic across the middle of my stomach so it works well under snug shirts. It's also a great length (I'm 5'1"" and they'd probably be a good length for anyone that or a few inches taller). They're also pretty soft, too, and opaque enough to wear like regular leggings.

I may just have to order these in every color now.",5
78204,All the toms shoes we have purchased for our girls have been great. They are cute and casual and for the most part are true to size. These however fit almost a whole size bigger then expected. Not sure why but we just let the kids grow into them over the summer.,5
877548,"I really like these pants. They are very comfy and long (I'm 5'10"") and wear a 3"" heel with them. They are roomy but if stretched tight they will be see-through so order large enough to prevent that or wear a long tunic!! They feel like pajama/lounge pants they're so comfy.",4
215966,"I wear a size 2 and this fits perfectly. The material though is very thin and nothing like ""cardigan sweater"". It's more like a thin t-shirt material. I like it, it's cute, but it will in no way keep you warm--only good for when there is a slight breeze or chill in the air.",4

When a person washes a garment for the first time, you hope it does not shrink too much or leave dye all over the other garments in the washer.

It came pressed and nicely packaged and we appreciated that attention to detail that so obviously went in to every aspect of the design and distribution of this product.",5

Unfortunately it does not look like the picture. The sleeves only go up to a little bit above my elbow, its a perfect fit around my arms not loose. Other than that it fits fine. I would recommend to get one size bigger.",3
168126,Really nice fit; true to size. They are extremely comfortable. Perfect for any workout you may choose to do.  Make a great legging too! Shipping was very quick.  I don't think you will be disappointed with your purchase of the Power Flex Capri.  It is a flattering fit with the right amount of compression. I finally feel completely covered with no fear of see through while working out or bending over :),5
53118,I love this hat so much. I got the orange one for my 3 month old and he has used it many times at the river and in pools. He is 5 months old now and we love it! The big brim is great and I love that the size is adjustable.,5
151302,"Its a great sweater for one time use. I ordered it for a party and wore it for a few hours, lights began falling out within the first hour but the sweater was still a hit. As long as you don't expect to wear it more than once, you will not be disapointed.",3
122588,"Initially I thought this necklace was very reasonably priced and proceeded to make the purchase for that reason. After receiving the shipment, I noticed how well packaged the necklace was and that the materials were heavy and of quality. I will definitely buy more pieces from this seller as cost and quality were apparent.",5
783460,These ties are so short there is nothing left of the short end once tied. It sticks out right below the knot. Also the fabric almost feels like plastic. It looks cheap. Between the and the size I believe this is meant for children. I contacted seller for refund but after I pay to ship it back it just isn't worth it.,1
85869,At first I thought this would be a cheap substitute for the elastic belt I have wanted for a long time.  I was pleasantly surprised to find it to be of high quality with a substantial polished brass buckle.  I don't think the belts sold by the fancy catalogs at several times the price can be very much better than this.  Blends well with khaki or navy pants.,5
512705,"I think I waited about a month and a half to get this swimsuit. When I finally got it, it was a different color than the picture. It is not light pink, it is a sort of bright coral-pink color, which is kinda disappointing. I am usually a size small but got a medium and it fits just fine.  I wish the padding on the chest were removable because they are sorta stiff. Besides the coloring it looks just like the picture.",3

317777,"DO NOT BUY THIS!!!! It looks nothing like the picture. The material is CHEAP and THIN!! I got a size medium I am 5'2"" and about 135 pounds. I had to pull it all the way above my ankle just so that the top could come up to my breast which really didn't matter because it still didn't cover them. The back is really low, the whole thing just looks awkward. AND my jumpsuits had a hole in the crotch area. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME!",1
638182,"Really cute dress, great style and fit. BUT, the color shown is a really pretty chocolate brown, and the actual dress is a weird almost olive green. Not what I was hoping for. :( I've had this issue with another cowcow dress, so be aware the colors are not necessarily accurate.",3

I say buy it what do we as woman have to loose!",4

Though they were the correct size, the shape they are sewn together make the heel part not stretchy to be able to get your foot in. While trying, threads in the colorful pattern broke and frayed.  Very disappointed.",1
353202,"I was actually looking for a leather strap that I could use for my walking staff, and this fit the bill perfectly. There are two long laces in the package, and they're strong enough for my purpose. I highly recommend this product for its intended purpose or for use as I did.",5
748432,"The red was a size bigger than the other two. All three were HUGE. The material was thin. I ordered XL like the chart suggested (I usually wear a M) and these did not fit at all. I could reorder a smaller size, but I didn't like the feel of the thin material. It felt hot against my skin. Even in a smaller size I don't think this would count as ""compression"".",3

Could probably squeez in a pen or something as well. Would definitely buy again and even as a gift.",5
158421,Never of this brand before so expectations were not very high. I needed a knitted tie in a hurry so Amazon Prime seemed like just the thing. Upon receipt I was impressed with the original packaging and fun packaging (zip lock bag). Each tie was in its own plastic sleeve. The attention to detail was definitely there. These are very good quality ties (not great) and will do the job without breaking the bank. I'll def buy again from BMC.,5
367633,"Cute in style; however, I thought their clothing was a 3xxx in ""American Size"" but its mainly for ""Asian Size"" women. Dress did not fit even a half of me and nor do they carry ""American Sizes"", such as 1x, 2xx, 3xxx. Guess I should have read the labels more carefully.",3
703571,"This is really a woman's jacket, even thought the description says men.  The jacket is a shiny, satiny fabric.  It is really a cute jacket.

Really, really cute tho!",4

570455,"If I could give this 0 stars it would be too much!!!  I ordered a 2XL and it was so small it barely fit my daughter who is a small/medium.  And the worst part of ordering this jacket is, it would have cost OVER $250 to ship it back to CHINA!!!!  So needless to say I am stuck with it!!!  I will NEVER, EVER order from this company again.  Make sure when you place an order it ships from inside the USA or you will get shafted like I did.",1
5316,"Very comfortable work pants with quality stitching and deep pockets.  Are a great pant for the summer since they are a thinner, cooler material than regular blue jeans.  Also the lighter color material doesn't get as hot in the sun and makes it easier to find crawling ticks.",5

794437,The arms are skinny but not too skinny. Boyfriend loves this shirt - it looks way more stylish on than it does in the picture! He has medium muscular arms though and the arms are tight. He prefers to wear the sleeves unbuttoned. If you have really muscular arms this shirt wouldn't fit,5
58200,"This is the oddest sized hat I have ever encountered. It is both to small and to large on
my average sized noggin. It's way to short to cover my ears, touches the tops, and
way to large in diameter to fit snugly enough not to blow away in the wind. I,m using
mine as a dusting rag.",1
299073,Second time ordering this. The first one was better than the second one. The first one was cream and was great but ripped so I ordered a black one and ordered it a size up (the first one rolled down). The clips on the black one have not worked they come undone all the time and since it is a size up it fits very well and very comfortably so the clips shouldn't be a problem. After a few wears it started to roll down also a little at the top. I do love the product.,4

Everyone thought it looked so pretty. I am 5'0 and 115 pounds, with heels this dress was the perfect length. I bought a size small.",5
99759,"I am actually very satisfied with my purchase.  The zipper broke on the front of the satchel about a week after getting it, but that really did not deter me from using it or liking it.  It is very large and will hold just about anything but the kitchen sink!  I still love it!",4
789255,"This skirt is cut large.  I wear a small and ordered this size, but the overall cut is too large.  There's a bit too much fabric and so in wearing it, it looks as if I ordered a size too large.  I probably will not be wearing it often.  Though it's below the knee, it's too long on me.",3
536750,"I wear this all the time, looks great onto of a black tank top with jeans or a skirt. Nothing has broken so far, had it 6 months or so. While I can't synch my waist as tight as the picture, it's a great corset and I would buy it again.",5
120309,I bought these in 3T for my skinny 2T child (in the hopes of them fitting this and next year). They only just fit and are a bit tight in the legs even though she has very skinny legs. The quality and function are excellent. I have both snap and non snap and do not have a problem with the snaps holding.,4
811237,"These gloves were ok. I used the measurements listed when purchasing them, but they ended up being shorter than described. The rhinestones could be beautiful, but they would look a little more real if they were slightly smaller. The larger rhinestone pieces make item look cheap. The draw string closure is by far the best feature, making sure the gloves fit perfectly.",3
2857,The leather is very cheap and the buckle is very very cheap... I used it one and the paint was coming of and the leather stretched so it fit loose after the first use. The leather was very thin and made of small peace's of leather... just now a good product.,1
739242,"This shirt fits just as shown in the picture.  I absolutely love the shirt and have received many compliments on it.  I like my clothes to be a
little baggy (as shown in the picture) but I know lots of women like clothes to fit snugger.  Every time I wear it I get at least one or two
compliments . . . and requests as to where I purchased it.",5
796320,"Wow.  The shirt I received is NOT by Simply Southern at all.  It is 100% cheap, slippery polyester fabric, with cheap white threading half on and half off the shirt.  It was listed as in stock, in the USA.  Instead after I bought it, it took weeks to get here and came from China and is SOO obviously a knockoff.  NOT EVEN close.. in any way.  Sad, because it was my daughters Christmas present.  DO NOT ORDER.  NOT A SIMPLY SOUTHERN shirt.",1
113480,"Wore this to a themed wedding. Fit well and I am an adult woman. Only downsides were I wish this had the same vibrancy of color on both sides. The straps for my fingers ripped by the end of the night, but could easily be pinned back. Decent for the price and purpose.",4
177267,"I bought this bathing suit in sz large, because of the other comments regarding sz. I am typically a small-med (5'5"" 130lbs)
Despite it's size, the bathing suit is really cute, (top is not padded, and was a bit narrow for my chest) and I received lots of compliments on it. I'd buy it again...for the price, you can't really go wrong. One downside is that no tracking was provided, so I had no idea when it was due to arrive, and the arrival window was very broad. Regardless, the suit arrived in time for my trip!",4
277801,I love the way it fits around my body but the stitching has started coming out bad to a point I can't use it anymore I've been using this off n on for about 3 months maybe I just received a bad one but it's completely useless as of now.,3
525993,"Another stunning set that exceeds my expectations!!! This one is absolutely worth every penny! The sellers always get it here before the estimated delivery date, which is why I love to purchase my A&A from them, also they sell for less than other sellers, PLUS free shipping! The colors are so beautiful, with the most intensely blue beads! I was NOT disappointed!",5
381463,"Bought it as an early gift for my mom who desperately needed a carrier for her new laptop. I received this the next day and I'm very pleased with my choice. It checked all my boxes by being professional looking, classy, casual yet durable. My mom is very pleased as well and I plan to purchase another for myself. She is a small business owner and I'm an administrative assistant/student. This bag will serve both of our needs elegantly.",5
569180,"Perfect for the Seinfeld fan!  I bought this for Father's Day for my dad who regularly quotes the series.  We're heading to the beach in a month, so it will be an awesome vacation shirt!  This t-shirt is a heavier quality and the blue color is is a lovely pastel.  I like that it has the year ""97"" on it- other Summer of George t-shirts do not have the year of the actual series/episode.  The t-shirt is worth the price and seems like it will hold up well with many washings.",5
806853,This dress has some stretch to it. I could have gone down a size but I'd rather take it in than receive it too small. It's a heavy weight fabric and will need to be steamed out out the package. I bought it for Disneyland's Dapper Day and am super happy with my purchase.,5
111122,"It's a bathrobe, and it functions as expected. The brown one even makes you look like a Jedi.

The cloth is super-absorbent.

I expected the stitching to fall apart but it seems to be holding up fine after many wash/dry cycles. There were some loose threads when I received it, but they all disappeared after the first wash/dry cycle.",5
444637,"This is my second time purchasing from this seller & I am once again a very satisfied customer. Wasn't sure what I would wear with these when I ordered them, but didn't care they're so cute! Package arrived on time in a cute leopard print box. They are very lightweight but don't feel cheaply made (although you can tell they are not as sturdy as they would be if they were name brand). Can't wait to rock these & I will definitely order from this company again.",5
848715,"The pictures are pretty accurate. The shorts aren't too short, which I appreciate. The style and fit are the same in person, but the color is more of a sky blue than the blue in the picture. I personally like the color better that way. The quality for the price you pay is so much better than I was expecting. It's not see-though, even when I wore a black bra. The only gripe I have is that I wish the sleeves were more flared at the end, but all in all it's an excellent purchase.",5
193005,"can't wait for it to warm up so i can wear this little ditty. it's really cute and fits well. i'm 5'7 115lbs and ordered the smallest size possible. i wish it was a little longer but i struggle with that dilemma all the time, so nothing new. there is an empire waist seem that will probably be better covered by a thick belt. but very chic and romantic, cute with skinny jeans and flats! my advice: buy it!",4
805809,"Better attention to detail than many costumes. If you're curvy and on the fence about what size to buy, I found it to run a little large. It's a little stretchy and looks better after washing since the faux fur looks matted down when you pull it out of the bag. I paid around $40 for it, so it's a great costume for the price. The mask is the best cat mask I've gotten with a costume, including some that were twice the price.",5
166772,"These capris are the absolute best! I have two pairs of capris and a pair of pants. Being 5'4"", I struggle with pant lengths.. these fit perfectly. They pass the squat test for sure! If I had a lot of money, I would seriously purchase the capris and pants in every color! I wear these every where.. kayaking, running, and strength training. They are not see through like some others. They are comfortable and supportive; but still light weight. I wore them kayaking the other day on a sunny, hot day and was fine. Never felt hot. So happy!",5
116108,"If the look in his eyes was the measuring tool, the dress is a hit.  Clings nicely without announcing where my belly-button is.  Clings without feeling constrictive.  Light, and easy to pack.  This is going to be my go-to little black dress for travel...when HE is with me ;)",4
344844,"There are so many things wrong with this garment I don't even know where to start. It is very very thin poor quality fabric. I'm talking like the stuff they make child's Halloween costumes out of.  The measurements aren't true to size. I ordered a 3X and it would be a stretch to think that it would actually be more like a large. It is also very short, would fit more like a crop then a wide leg floor length like depicted in the picture. I ordered this thinking it would be a fun date night outfit so disappointed.",1
269350,"Great suit for Great Price! I bought this for my daughter to take to Europe. Such a cute suit and fit in well on the beaches there- a bit too risqu here in the states though :) Good quality for such an inexpensive suit. Covers all the important bits. Arrived super quick. Product stamp does show, but who's looking at that :)",5
423601,"The item pictured is not the correct item. I ordered it and it came as a square one-sided key chain. I can say this, the seller was TOP NOTCH making sure I was satisfied. Apparently Amazon has the wrong picture to match the actual item so it is not the sellers fault!!",4
845578,"I owned the red version of this shirt already and bought the dark grey one because I liked the red one so much. Great fit for women, it has curves where they are supposed to be. This shirt has no chest pockets, but some small pockets on the sleeves just big enough for a pen.  It's tailored enough that it can be tucked into jeans, but not so tight that you cannot wear it un tucked. Love it!",5
880660,"Upon initially receiving this, I was in love with it. I loved the color and the design. After wearing it for only a couple weeks though, the rose gold plating was already starting to wear off and looked dull and tarnished. I did not wear it to the pool or beach, but I did leave it on when I showered. If you purchase this, I would recommend that you take it off to polish it every day. This is not one of those anklets that you can just leave on day and night. :(",2
120390,"Love that I don't have to use disposable swim diapers.  Beautiful pattern and love the ruffles in the back.  The snaps on the side are so nice when removing it when its wet.  My daughter is 16 months old and 23 lbs. and I had to get the 3T size and it is still snug and leaves red marks and the leg openings, hasn't been too much of an issue as she's not in them for more than 1-2 hours.",4
34907,"The picture shows a thin frame but the ones I received had wide frames. Several years ago, I ordered a 6 pack from the same seller. The vertical measurement of those lenses was much narrower.

The 6 pack I recieved this week are being returned. The lenses are way to big for reading glasses.",2

The dress rides rides up my hips and back and scrunches up in the middle. It is very comfortable but rather short. If you have a slender frame I think this dress would be perfect for you but otherwise...",3
644344,"Decent construction. Shade is more yellow than the orangish color shown. The main item picture shown makes the lens/frame shape look a little pointy, in reality they are very typical, average sized aviators.  When I put them on I noticed the lens quality was quite nice and that they seem to be polarized, but its more subtle than most I have. Either way,. good bang for the buck.",5
604035,"Lovely dress.. I'm about 4'11 - 5', not very big / small in size, and I bought a small. The only part that didn't fit well was the top, which was a little too large on the shoulders - but that can be adjusted. It fits well otherwise, and reaches on the knees or just below.",4
92536,"I bought this as my first GPS watch. There is a bit of a learning curve to figure out which buttons to push to navigate the features, but with a little trial and error I was able to get it to do what I wanted. I'm 5'4"" and have small bones and it's pretty big on my wrist, but it's comfortable enough. The GPS is works well. I've only had it lose signal once, after which if found the signal again almost immediately (I live in an area with lots of trees).",4
430834,"the coat does have a slim fit, so if you got a belly, you may want to think twice.  There are two large buttons on the collar which look a little out of place.  Also, there is a lining inside that can be removed (buttons).  It is also a little long too.",4
184835,"The bag is great, just the right size and number of pockets.  The problem with it is that the metal is very cheap and the minute I pulled on the long shoulder strap, the metal snapped and it became unusable.

Also I got the Lumpy Space Princess one and it's pink, not purple. I know it's a good price, but it kinda isn't worth it if you're looking for something superb.

Obviously I will still wear this...I mean I paid for it, right? But yeah, it's disappointing. I try to pretend that it's purple but everyone I ask says it's pink.",3
682511,These socks are the most amazing baby socks.  A friend introduced these to me by buying them for my newborn.  With our daughter her socks kept falling off.  These socks actually stay on and don't cause any indentation on the leg either.  I wish I had thought of these!,5
20067,"Bought this for my 5mo, and I love it.  It's very soft and light. And provides lots of shade for his head,neck, and shoulders.  I bought 6-18 mo since my kids usually run large in the craniums- and this is a good fit.  The hat has a toggle adjustment to keep it  fitting well.  Great product!",5
864520,"It is nice design, but the size of sleeves did not fit: the sleeves are too tight, hardly can move arms; also the front part is too short, especially when I raise a bit my arms - so have to return. Give 4 stars as overall it is nice and would fit someone else.",4
8563,"I bought a pair of these for my son in June, size 12, about 2 months ago I noticed the side of each shoe is separating from the sole, where the little toe is. So he got about 4 months of service from theme. I am buying 2 more pair direct from Vans so if the rip, I can send them back. I am also buying in a larger size..",2
340104,Awful. Why does the picture show a kid? The hat is huge! Even too big for my big dome. And the Hair part doesn't go all the way down the beanie so there's a band that has nothing on it. This also took forever to arrive although it did get here sooner than promised. I do not recommend.,1
848457,Sucks to have to get something altered because it's so incredibly big. I ordered the smallest size possible and it's still maybe two or three sizes too large. Is there a company that makes vintage for petite women?! I have to budget extra money for alterations each time I order a dress. :/,3
607583,"The label should be ""Joe's Vietnam""... because that's where this shirt is made. Well hey Joe, if you wanna sell Americans, maybe you ought to employ AMERICANS.
In any case, the shirt fits as expected, and appears to be well-made with no defects. The material feels the same as that found on a Dickie's work shirt.",4

36873,The image gives you the impression that a child could wear this wig. The child in pictures lookes between the age 10-12. It's no way a child older than 2 can wear this wig. This is a toddler wig. The cap is very small. If you read the great reviews they all reference their child being 3 years old. What 3 year old will keep on a wig. Good luck with that. What a waist of money. I had to return it at my expense. A complete lost,1

Overall pleased with the dress.",5

I have had them a few months and already the upper checkered material has come apart and separated from the sole of the left shoe. This doesn't prevent me from wearing them, and I still do, but it is disappointing since the rest of the shoe is in like-new condition. It seems almost like a defect specific to just this design since I also have an all black model slip-on just like these which I've had longer and this did not happen.",3
414513,I just received this bag and so far I love it. The color is a little deeper than in the picture- it's actually nicer. The bag looks to be very high quality- sturdy and the leather is soft. It has a lot of room with 4 zippered external pockets plus the main compartment with an internal pocket. The straps are slightly padded and very comfortable. It's a lovely bag and so far I'm very happy with this purchase. If anything changes I will update this review.,5

I know some people personally like when the shoes are a bit tighter or a bit looser so it's all in personal preference.",5

547749,This was a gift for my mother-in-law and it is actually too big for her.

We are going to see if we can alter it in for her at the seams.,5

I would really really suggest purchasing this ring.",5

Also the elastic in the waist band was way to small for the waist and causing it to bunch up. Also they had an awful chemical smell as I took them out of the cellophane bag. I would not be able to recocend these to anyone, even if they're only $8.",2
788934,"I reviewed the wrong dress below.  This dress is pretty, however, is poorly constructed. The strap hooks were not sewn on well
and came off immediately while trying to put the dress on.  I had to pin the straps around the neck and bodice with safety pins.
Afterwards, while trying to remove the dress, the zipper jammed and I was unable to unzip the dress. Eventually, I did have
to cut myself out around the zipper.
I'm requesting some refund on this gown because I invested around $170 in it and couldn't wear it
properly.
I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS GOWN!!",1
628117,This dress is STUNNING! I bought it for a wedding and I'm so pleased with the material. It's rich and thick and such a beautiful dress. I'm 5'9 and it drags when I'm bare feet so I'll definitely be wearing this with heels! What a great dress for the price.,5
142877,"Material is a bit thin, but it looks very nice. However, there was a black streak of dirt or ink smeared on the scarf inside the packaging. This was a gift so I didn't have time to send it back. I carefully tried getting the stain out and was only able to lighten it. It's not too noticeable and the scarf can be manipulated to not show it. Careful packaging may have prevented this. It was a hit with my 12 year old daughter though.",4
570667,"I like the fabric, I was surprised it was nice and warm and decent quality for the price. However they did not fit. Not even close. I'm 5'1"", about 200, maybe 210 lbs, I carry all of my weight in my bust and abdomen, and these weren't long enough to get past my thighs. Very disappointing. I guess I'll freeze!",2
811522,"The top fit perfectly, but the bottoms are a bit small. I will probably mix the top with a different pair of bottoms I already own. I love the top so much it is worth the money even if I can't wear the bottoms!

I received the product for free or at a discount.",5
452802,The pin looks absolutely beautiful! Got it for a friend who is a major Ariel fan and she loved it to pieces. The gold and jewel accents on it are especially pretty to look at. Can be worn or used for display. Either way it was a very good buy.,5
67897,"Loved this bag. Nice leather in Gray. Excellent quality. Too small for me. Unfortunately it looked silly on my mature and full-figure frame, and being it was my first try with a backpack bag, I found it too awkward to position on my back. So, I returned it. Would have kept it if I hadn't looked like a complete dork wearing it.",4
375382,"I was so excited to receive this skirt. In person the print isn't as crisp or sharp, more blurry and the material is of a low quality. The stitching at the waistline was odd,as well. I don't usually complain about stitching at this price point, but it effects the way the skirt sits at your waist. I still like the skirt enough to keep it but it was a bit of a letdown",3
111105,"Very nice robe which I bought for my teenage son. He might have fit in the small/med, but I wanted it to last him a few years which it looks like it will do. Pre-washed: there was some fluff, but not more than other terry towels I have bought. I am quite pleased with this purchase!",5
703832,"Ordered March 19 and arrived April 02 for $54.35.  Material is thin and falls nicely.  The should is narrow, therefore the shoulder pads are in the middle between neck and where the arm begins.  I am a true size 14,  I would say this jacket is about a size 10.  I wish it's a bit bigger.",4
27297,"At first I thought ""these are great"" but then after awhile they started bothering the outer right side of my foot so I took them out. It feels at times like I am walking with a small golf ball under my foot in the middle to the outer right side.
I will try and get use to them since the Podiatrist recommended them.",3
785899,"The overall quality of this bag is very good. The outer material of the bag is sturdy. As for the inner lining, it is also strong. There isn't any loose threads. The only thing that I wished for is there is an option for a bag that is wider in the bottom. Other from that, this is a good deal for the price.",5
565758,"The t-shirt itself is of good quality.  It is a decent thickness, the graphic seems to be holding up well thru washes, and the shirt maintains its size after washing.  This also got lots of good chuckles for my wife who is a teacher who wore it during a Tshirt day during their school's spirit week.  She says her kids still chuckle and go ""Sshhhhh"" as an inside joke to her.",4
307415,"I don't know what is up with these shorts. Not sure if these were previously ordered by someone with a ton of cats and dogs and then returned, but i ordered the black and navy blue shorts and both have a ton of fibers/hair on it. I mean if this was a returned item sent to me, amazon sucked at checking it. Debating returning them unless amazon wants to send me a lint brush. Makes matters worse they are running a tad small.",1
665710,"I'm writing to tell you the product I received is nothing like the photos. I'm 5'1"" and the pants are too short. They are tapered at the ankle, not a wide leg all the way down. The waist band is also way too large. If I try to wear them lower the inseam hangs way too low. They should not be selling this product as represented in the photos. They are misrepresenting the product 100%. I am completely dissatisfied with this purchase. Do not buy. I contacted the seller...we'll see what they say.",1
233741,"I was always going into a dark restaurant and could not read the menu or even worse the bill.  ThinOPTICS has solved this problem.  I always have my cell phone with me and with the new ThinOPTICS and phone case I always have my reading glasses with me.

I highly recommend this product.",5
232959,"I love this Crabby Wallet!  When I first layed my eyes on it I thought, there is no way I could possibly put all my cards in there!  To my HUGE suprise I could! and more!  I'm a chick that doesn't like using the huge and girly looking check and credit card wallets.  This suits me just right!  Not too manly and not too girly!
  Thanks Crabby Wallet! Many Blessings

""I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review""",5
298629,"This was my second order. I bought one of these a couple years ago and it worked perfectly for me. I am able to keep my business cards, credit/debit cards in it as well as my ID with no issues. The fact that it is real leather and so inexpensive is perfect because it stands up to a lot of use. The reason I had to buy another one is the front edge (where the cards go) leather is folded over and mine had come undone. It still worked, I just got tired of folding the flap back in.",5
251311,"I was hesitant to buy sunglasses online, but I'm very pleased with these. They fit well (woman with slightly big head, hat size 7 1/8). They're comfortable and the perfect solution for driving or reading at the beach. I considered to get blended bifocal sunglasses at my eye doctor, but for the amount of time I need them, the price is way too much. These are a perfect solution. They even come with a stylish hard case and a cleaning cloth.",5
55175,"My son, 4, was starting to grow out of his other crocs and kept asking me for a new pair. I saw these on Amazon and decided to give them a try since the price was so good. Not disappointed at all. The colors are great, the sizing ensures that my little guy will get to hang onto these for a long time and the price couldn't be any better. My son also says that they are very comfy. He has to wear them everywhere. Would definitely recommend.",5
160818,"I absolutely love it,I want to buy some more. The only thing that would make it perfect for me is if the strap length"" although is the best I have found so far"" where if the length could be around 4"" longer if possible. Like I said love it,would like more of them. Thank You for your product,and speedy delivery.",4
674553,"odd thing about these, they came as 2 pack, white ones are comfy and roomy.  black ones are soooo uncomfortable, the straps on top are tight and dig in to tops of your feet.  So, I want to keep the whites and return the blacks but I don't think it works that way.  Also, this is not my first pair of Tony's sandals, they really do have a nice arch support considering they are flip flops.",2
176990,I've been looking for a bathing suit for A LONG TIME THAT WOULD FIT ME!!! I have a long time for one that would fit my long torso PERFECT!!! I will more than likely be ordering  a few more just because of the way it fit so well. I LOVE IT!!!!  I have a little extra in uptop and down below! so If you have curves you need THIS!!!!,5
353661,"Terrible product quality.
I've been using another product with which I was so satisfied.
Bought a couple of these bangles for my family members and with in 2 days of wear the magnets started to fall out.
They are tiny little magnets and are easily lost and it's hard to stick them back.

I guess the price says it all.

Wouldn't recommend. Waste of money.",1
475691,"Returning these.  Love Kendra Scott and love the style of these earrings, but - the turquoise stone in these are just flat plain color.  I anticipated a more 'granite' look with veining per the picture.  Will maybe shop in person for these to ensure I get the look I want.
Otherwise, nothing wrong with these earrings.  They were in perfect condition and shipped quickly!",3
481386,"I love wearing this out in public! I get so many complements and they are a good conversation starter! They're kind of snug but overall the sizing was good. I would definitely wear a skirt, some shorts or a long shirt with it as it is see through... But other than that, great product! I would definitely recommend.",5
159311,"If you wear a small this would be good for you. The wrist parts are really small and since i'm really petite this fits well. If sleeves are normally too long for you this will fit perfectly! there's a lot of extra room in the bust and stomach area, but in the sleeve area not so much.",4
554593,"Great quality.  A bit stiff/large when first bought, but it broke in fairly quickly. Beautiful color and quality is great.  It surprisingly looks and feels like leather..

The logo on the front did wear off fairly quickly, but only reveals the darker cork beneath, so it doesn't look bad.  Interested to see how well it holds up!  So far, I would definitely purchase from this company again.",5
743410,"Seems like it could be a decent, cheap windbreaker but MY GOD is it tiny. I'm on the heavier side, usually wear XL shirts. Read the reviews here and saw that people recommended going 1 size larger, so I went ahead and got the XXL. If I could zip the thing up, I would have asphyxiated myself. I simply can't wear it and had to return it.

If it would have fit, I would have liked it.",2
80580,"While these are cute, they all broke within a week. I do understand they are plastic, but the regular beaded necklaces seem to last much longer. My daughter likes to use them for dress up. So while I think they would be decent enough for adult use, I wouldn't recommend them for kids.",2
447831,Got this anklet for my fiance.  It blew her mind when she opened the box!!!  This thing has some serious BLING to it.  It is a perfect fit as it can stretch.  It looks good as an anklet and a bracelet.  Definitely perfect for more dressy occasions.  The CZ are bright and eye catching.  Seems to be well made.,5
171369,"The other reviews said it was too small, so im about a medium, and ordered the large and it fit perfect. the metal clasps were really uncomfortable. i have a sewing machine and just removed the clasps and sewed it shut. fits great, comfy and cinches me in really well. for the price, you cant go wrong.",4
698580,"This deserves a written review, since i was so skeptical before buying, since it didn't have one. Im very pleased with what I've received, i was worried it would be to small or it wouldn't have a hood or the material would be crappy since its coming from China or it would say pink queen somewhere on the jacket but i was wrong! And it arrived early. It was worth the 60$ and the month wait:) i haven't gotten the chance to wear it on a rainy windy day yet but I'll leave another review on that later.",5
531929,"The shoulder/ top part of the shirt was a little too close together, it rode upwards on my arm pit a bit, but the rest of the shirt in length and size was fine. It was so cheap, and I needed a camo shirt for a mud-race anyway so I was okay with it.",4
120629,"Great item!!!! No leaks in the pool!! They run somewhat small but they need to be so that nothing comes out. My son started to wear size 6-12 months at 4 months... He was about 13 pounds but they were marking him. He is now 7 1/2 months and 19 pounds and 6-12 months fit perfectly. Buying the diapers with the clips on the side definitely help... If they were the pull up ones, they probably wouldn't fit!",5
631869,"Light ant breathable. There could be a seam sewn around the leg opening I don't see these lasting long due to that one fault. Only used for sleeping, the sheer is well sheer, but I believe any color you eventually will be exposed, so if you wear them outside of the bedroom underwear is a must",5
806797,"Super Adorable! This shirt is absolutely toooo cute! I recently gave my friend's son this shirt and the fit was perfect! He is 3.5 and I got the 4T. He received so many compliments when we were walking on the street. The best part: he didn't want to take the shirt off :)

 I am very grateful to have purchased the item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",5
416293,"Great hat, fit a tad snug, but stretched a bit after wearing it for a day or two, and now it's just right. Only gripe is that it has all these unnecessary patches sewn on, which I feel detracts from the look. I'd be more okay with it if the patches were from its time as a truck tarp, but there's no holes under them, they're clearly sewn on the make it look more ragged, but it takes more away from the look than it adds, IMHO.",4
827671,"I'm in love! It looks and fits great. I love it so much I'm ready to buy another. It's fits me perfect and I'm 5'3, 163lbs with medium bust. I normally wear a size 10-12 or large. This suit gives me confidence to be at the beach again after becoming a mom of two.",5
384329,"Ok, I don't know anything about earrings or these things-I'm not judging so leave me alone!  I'm using them for something else and bought these for the skull part.  The detail is very good, they say its bone.  I'll have to go with that since I can't prove otherwise.  Hopefully I'll be able to make them work for my project.  As earrings, or whatever they are light and flaired in the front and back with a smooth center section. The skull part is 3D.  Looks sharp. If that helps. I'm sure you'll look dashing.",4
157700,The SMELL???!!!!  I had to throw them away because the smell wouldn't wash out.  It's a chemical smell that has come with several items I've purchased from Amazon that apparently come from China.  I wish I could weed those factories out when I search for items I'm looking for.,1
289398,"I expected a bit more. The designs are cute and will give you a laugh. the material is somewhat stretchy which is an good thing because the band seems small I wear a size 8 shoe and the heel of the sock was just after mine. don't know how they wash, but  I don
't think there will be a problem, the material feels ok. For the price Its worth it. May get a set for myself!!  Verified Purchaser",3
502632,"It's cute and I like what it says.  My BFF will love it.  I was surprised how small the pyramid is but my daughter said she likes it small because most people don't want a big pyramid medallion on their neck. It is the size of the tip of my pinky.  Like I said,  I think the recipient is going to like it.",4
184657,"I struggled with one rest zipper when it arrived, it took some real strength and whathaveyou to get it open, then closed, open then closed. It finally worked out whatever kink it had. Love the bag because it matches my muddy girl 9 mm pistol...carries great but we ultimately altered the two hand straps to make it a cross body carry so I have easier access to pistol. Fabric great, seems very durable...lots of easy access pockets inside.",4
125245,"Nothing fancy, nor fashion. Plain looking. The material is kind of thin. Perfect for summer time. I bought it for playing golf under sun. It covers my ears and back neck. It serves the purpose.

Based on the other reviews, I bought a XL. It is just a little bit big, but OK for me.",4

I buy everything in medium, now that I've gained weight and the smalls are more form-fitting than I like.  But this, even in medium, fits like a small and has very little stretch.  When I lose weight (!) the medium ""might"" fit well enough to wear, but, for your own sanity, buy one size up!  Because of the drawstring belt, there should be no waist-band gap...",2
546278,"I'm a medium but I suspected this product would fit better as a large, and that turned out to be definitely true.  I looked at a number of cardigans before this one, tried a few, but this is the only one that's just right.  Nice and lightweight, excellent lines as it falls, a comfy-classy look.",5
434000,"I've been looking for shorts like these forever! The're amazing. I got the black ones and I wear them under a supershort handkerchief-cut skirt for salsa. I got them in medium (I'm a size 7 in jeans) they fit great, and they don't have that weird sheen some spandex shorts do. Overall, very very happy with these :)",5
489954,"Too small, but it fits my girlfriend! She's like a My-Size Barbie, coming in at like 5'9, so at least the coat didn't go to waste. She rocks the s*** out of this thing. So... If you're a 6' male that clocks in at about 210, broad shoulders and a belly that says you and bacon are old friends, just skip it and buy it as a winter overcoat for your wife. You will not fit in this thing. It's a good lookin coat, though.",3
281954,I just received this and from the moment I opened the package I knew it was a fake! Its not authentic RL and pins are used to fold it which when removed leaves obvious holes! It does not even have a care tag on it. The color is as expected and material isn't bad its just for the price i paid it should be authentic. Disappointed!,1
609947,"I bought 3 of these sets - Cinderella, princess, and mermaid - for my niece who loves jewelry and she absolutely loves them! She's 6 years old and appreciates each set she has. They are durable and put together very nicely with stretchy materials for easy wear and removal. I highly recommend them!",5
254187,"Great looking light saber.  The latch broke pretty easily and the switch sometimes is not easy to find, but for the price, this is the perfect playtime kylo ren saber.  The side pieces do NOT light up.  The end extends out and you can lock the sword in the closed position (but be careful as that piece can break easily)

Pros:
Looks good, nice detail
Lights up
Cheap

Cons:
Flimsy locking piece
On/Off Switch hard to see
Side Pieces do not light up",4

Overall, I like these gloves. I may purchase another pair later for casual wear.",4
308335,"I like this shapewear for the following reasons: 1) it is sexy not like others which are kind of ""grandma"" panties; 2) it doesn't roll down after some time during the day; 3) the wires at the back make my waist look even smaller; 4) it lets me breath so I don't feel like too tight.",5

Prince was a genius and one of the greatest performer-musicians of all time.",5
46728,I already owned a grey pair & ordered the black. They are very easy to carry in a pocket. They are very comfortable to wear & fit securely. I have always had problems with headbands sliding up & exposing my ears; even some hats don't protect the ears very well. Love these ear mitts!!,5

The finish has held up well, no fading

32643,These are my fav flip flops.  Love to wear them around the house and if I happen to run out with them on I don't feel like I'm walking barefooted.  The straps were a little loose on this particular pair but otherwise the quality is good and the straps don't feel flimsy.  I try to buy them on sale so it's a good deal when I find them.,4
440890,This is a great shoe for young children.  I like that there are not any laces to fuss with.  My child can easily slip them on and off.  The pattern is fun and subtle.  The shoe runs true to size and comes in half sizes which is hard to find in this type of shoe.,5
485885,great hat. just the right weight and fit. it is a light wool tweed wearable in all seasons.  the brown is not too dark so it coordinates with almost every earth color. i have had several favorable comments about the hat. i wear in conjunction with a woolrich light brown tweed vest and chiinos.,5

I received the bracelet after 2 weeks of purchase, so I was really surprised when I opened my mailbox to see it sitting in there.

The only thing that bothers me, the bracelet is too big for my wrist, so it turns around, I even have it on the bracelet clasp and it's still too big.

Ever all, it's such a cute bracelet and I'm very pleased.",4
834164,Not a 3 star. Not a 5 star. It's my own fault though. I thought this was a classic fit but it's a custom fit. The custom fit looks great on the first wear but one time in the wash and it shrinks up to the size of something I'd find in the boys department. If you're OK with hang drying your clothing I'm sure it would a good choice for you.,4
653289,"Almost exactly as pictured. Only difference is the dark green on the necklace is actually light--except for when the light green is outlined with dark; that dark is true to color--but I think that makes the necklace even more lovely, because of the swirling patterns within the lighter green.

Otherwise, it's a tried-and-true purchase, definitely one I'm glad I made!",5
836013,They definitely are worth the price. If it was possible I would make the regular glass in the middle a little smaller. The edges are a little too far away from the middle of the eyes and it makes for less of a light show. Still some awesome glasses though.,5
107756,"The costume is cool but extremely short- I am 5'8'' and it barely covers my bottom, I had to buy leggings. The thigh highs that come with the costume roll down your legs anyway. Also, I weigh 135 lbs and thus bought a medium and it was somewhat big on me.",3
58782,"This was a dream of mine - to own a real feather fan - This is plastic, but appears to be ""real"" dyed feathers. The tassle pictured is not on the fan I recieved, but it is impressive, just the same. It will be an alluring addition to a costume of mine - I expect to use it often!",5
402641,"Disappointed. I didn't expect much for such an inexpensive costume, but the sleeves came with black stains all over them (possibly bleeding from the vest?). It should at least be clean. As an aside, the hat is pretty bad and the red sashes aren't the same color as the red skirt. I'm 5'3"" and 110 lbs. and the Small/Medium was somewhat large on me. I would have kept it and worn it without a hat if it hadn't had stains all over the sleeves.",2
681378,Buyer beware this product will not fit you if you are a taller individual and don't count on this seller mentioning that in any of the product descriptions.  So besides me paying basically $30 for a proiduct from them I don't have this costume is really awesome.  5 stars for the costume 1 star for 7th avenue costumes.,1
784593,"This is what I was looking for.  Black, simple, flowing, long enough to wear with a pair of leggings.  It is not fitted, nor snug around the body, so if you are looking for that, this is not the dress for you.

This is comfortable enough with a pair of leggings that I feel like I'm wearing PJs to office, but looks good enough that I still got compliments.",5
201462,"I am not very far along but I need to unbutton the top button of my jeans.  This band covered, smoothed and held everything in place.  The only problem was, that I could not get it to stop rolling when I would sit down. I have heard nothing but good things about the Bellaband from my friends, so maybe I'm not using it right.",4
7270,"I, a woman, love the fit of these jeans!  The lower rise is much more comfortable, and all the pockets are very handy.  This is my 2nd pair of these -- the 1st pair had just the right amount of Loose Fit (loose, but not baggy), so had to get another.",5
761395,"This quickly became one of my favorite dresses. The material isn't see-through but still light enough to wear in Summer. It is also a very flattering shape and cut; I really like the tie/wrap feature. It's not quite a true wrap dress but I like it better because if you catch a breeze nothing is flapping open, but you can still tie it tighter and such in the front. Anyway, I love this dress!",5
640943,"The material is very thin, not too flattering, and not realizing this was from China, my size was too small. It is very tight and shows all the details underneath the garment. The waistband is very tight and scrunched, and there's some extra fabric poking out of the seam. It would be appreciated if there was attention brought to the size chart. Cute though.",2

You should never hesitate to do business with Metal Masters and their obvious high standard of customer service and satisfaction.,5
750796,"Material is so soft. I ordered Medium and fits perfectly. The guy on the photo got nothing on me. I'm sexier I swear. lol I wish they make this in black or gray etc. It's worth it.

The fit and cut of this shirt is for women. Changed my ratings to 2 stars.",2
21468,"Perfect beach hat for the kid who hates to wear hats.  My one year old would constantly rip any hat off his head when were outside, but this hat solved that problem.  He can not easily get it off due to the adjustable head drawstring and It's lightweight material also keeps him from over heating.  The brim and extra material in the back keep both his face and neck protected from the sun.  Would definitely recommend!",5
272922,I really like this a lot. The needles are super sharp which makes things hurt way less. I like to pierce my ears a lot and doing it by your self I super hard but they have clamps so you can hold still. The only thing is the clamps get stuck and then the earring falls out. So having someone else might help a lot. :),4
580441,love.  it looks perfect looped twice around my neck.  this will look great with knit tops to add some additional warmth (I am always cold).  this is my first infinity scarf and I'm a convert!  I expect to be buying this in more colors as finances permit.,5

868156,"This ""dress"" is a joke. It's a poorly made sack. There is so much material at the top of the dress it literally looks like a plastic garbage bag. If you rip out the lining and gave it to Wendy, the talk show host, there would still be room. Ridiculous. That's money I'll never see again....",1
846542,"This 3 pack of barlettes are super cute I love them. I got them in an XL and they fit me really well I got 3 different colors a light blue, a light mint green and a really nice peachy color.  I really like the lace detail on them. The material is really nice super soft and comfortable they don't give you very good support but I think these would be super cute worn as a crop top. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",4
70558,"good for children about 12 yr. and under. they fit way to tight for my melon, and the construction of the sunglasses feels way to fragile. also the look of the actual finished product is way off from what you see online. I'll never shop for sun glasses online again.",2
264964,"Definitely my favorite pajamas to put our child in. We call our child our little astronaut. They fit well, appear to keep the kid warm enough, and the zipper functions well. They've not fallen apart throughout many machine wash/dry cycles and they don't have any obvious workmanship flaws. I'd buy 'em again, well.. except kids grow fast, so I won't.. but... you get what I'm saying.",5
728245,I received our shirts today and the fit is exactly as I expected. The material is a like any typical cotton t-shirt  thin but not see through. The lettering looks as if it'll last some washes and it was delivered in 4 days. I am very pleased with this purchase. Also requesting to have the text put on the backs of the shirts couldn't have been easier. I would definitely buy from this company again.,5
845903,"WAY BIG!!!!!! I looked like I was wearing a flour sack. The color isn't quite the same as the photo. Think bright royal blue. The ""cups"" for the breasts are not cups at all. I pretty much looked like I had the saggiest (is that a word? probably not) breasts in the world. I'm small, I know that, but this thing was a tent.",1
401615,"I must admit that I was a bit skeptical when I ordered this ring, being that it was so reasonably priced, but it's lovely.  It's dainty, but not flimsy.  The stone is nice and for the price, this is a great ring.  I got the peridot, but I'm going to get another color as well.",5
398396,"I can not believe two things:

first, the item is too large! I buy a medium one, but it came like LX!
second,when I return it back with $5 shipping, it came back again with a label said that I am late for returning! It came to my house in march 17, and it return at the company at Apr 12. It out of return time??

I had better read the all the review first, I can not believe this kind of company exit so long!

never buy anything from them!",1

604861,"I brought this for my daughters 5th grade graduation. She is 5' 4"" and weighs about 133 pounds. We brought an x-large and it fit just right. The only problem I had was that the cut seemed off and it was a little too short. She wore shorts under and you could see the leg part when she moved but it wasn't that bad. She looked amazing and she loved it.",4
794987,"This is a decent set of single flare tunnels. They all came with o-rings but the rings ranged from 2g to 0g and even some 00g. Interesting. But the tunnels are all 0g and fit well, they have a shorter flare that makes them very comforable to wear. The finish is not perfect but three sets of tunnels for this price is a pretty good deal.",4
722672,The product arrived packaged well however it could be a bit longer to hang as pictured.  It is a bit noisy when you are first putting it on but upon wearing it is definitely a conversation piece.  I would have given more stars but the stiffness and awkward craftsmanship at the neck takes away from the chic.,3
32795,"Love Hav's but don't remember sizing to be an issue in the past.  I regret that I didn't listen to other reviewer's and was too afraid of ""sizing UP"" because a women's 10 or 11 (I am a size 9) seemed ginormous.  If you are a true women's size 9, SIZE UP to a 41/42.  My heel hangs over slightly on the 39/40 which is supposed to be a women's size 9/10.  Nope.",3
707270,"Very nice suit.  Bought a 40S when I normally wear a 38S because of the reviews of it running small.  The pants fit perfect but the jacket is a little long in the sleeves. I'll get it tailored and won't be a problem.  I'm sure the 38S pants would have been too tight given how well these fit.  Great quality material, if I saw on someone wouldn't have guessed it was under $100.",4
2386,Ordered these for my daughter and they were way too big. I decided to save them because they're so cute. Now that they actually fit her she got to wear them twice.. As I was tying one shoe the string snapped and they can no longer be tied :( they also turned her feet orange both times she did wear them and it took major scrubbing to get them clean so beware!,2
96298,"I love this pin! I wish it came with the violin bow, just to have it displayed with the violin when not being worn as a pin. The back of the pin that holds it in place when on clothing is not as snug. I am scared that the violin will fall of of my clothing because it's not too secured by the backing. Overall, beautiful with such great attention to detail.",5

However, my 2yr old is able to get the backs off, we've had them a month or so and she has lost them multiple times. Sometimes I find them, sometimes I don't. I would not recommend these for kids. They are too easy to twist off.",1

It is the first time that I've been able to tie my tie and have normal length of the tail still there. This tie makes it possible to do other tie knots besides a half-York and still have enough length to look right.",5
869182,"Color is the same as picture, length is as expected (just above the knee, I'm 5'4""). I normally wear size 6 in jeans and a medium fits fine.

When it was received I noted that in the picture the watch had a simple black face, but the watch that I received had a black face with lots of small detail.

I paid a little more to get it shipped from Amazon thru prime than directly from Allegra K, I don't know if that impacted quality of the shirt.  I am very happy with this shirt.  It's slightly translucent, so a flesh colored bra or a camisole underneath is advised.",4

The material is thin but it didn't bother me. The cut of the bottom is like a bathing suit (this is not short) I wore it without a stockings/leggings but its still modest. I love the cape it gives me a lot of coverings but the arm cups are a bit big for my arm. I feel like a real Wonder Woman with this costume.,5

I would not have purchased had I known.",3

735544,"Didn't fit at all, I am a very short person with a very short torso and it still barley went past my butt if I pulled it down as hard as I could. It's more like a sweater than a dress. I was very disappointed because it would have been cute if made longer like the picture.",1
295618,I was a little weary of ordering a choker because I was worried it would be too big since I have a slim neck however I was pleasantly surprised. It came in a plastic bag with the brand Cornucopia printed on it and inside there are two individual bags with the chokers. It's nice to have an extra choker in case one breaks or stretches so I'm glad I ordered this in a pack.,5
693964,"Every buyer seems to get a different dress. I was very unhappy that my dress didn't come as pictured. It does not have the Flower designed on the front or that cream color so much a ugly printed on flowers on a lighter colored top. Also it had a rip in the front, Buy at your own risk. Some girls seem to have gotten what was pictured but most do not.",1
198288,"I think this is a super cute suit and it's the best knockoff, but it's WAY too small. I ordered a S and I'm 5'7 and 124 lbs, and it barely goes on me. I ordered a M instead, and I'm hoping this fits better. Otherwise, it's the cutest suit ever.",3
690774,"This robe is perfect. Super soft material, nice quality.  Bought size 14 for my 11 year old, and it fits well with room to grow.  Throws it on in the morning or after a shower, and likes that it has a hood. Great price, really happy with this purchase.",5
499076,"There was a printing issue with the shirts I bought (see Divergent Factions T-Shirt Women's Cap Sleeve review), but they contacted me immediately, offered me a refund or a replacement, and got it to me in two days. Still in time for my daughter's party. AMAZING customer service! The shirts I got are great!",5
44553,"I knew these shoes fit a little snug so I ordered an 8 since I wear 7.5 and I love them! They are gorgeous and comfy. They do not hurt my feet to wear, even though I rarely wear heels. They're sturdy, easy to walk in, and go with everything...dresses, slacks, shorts. I would highly recommend these, but please order the next size up. I'm going to get the pinstripe pair next, then the reds one!!!",5
408350,"Firstly, I'd like to say I ordered this by accident, tried to cancel, to no avail It will be going back. It is a very pretty skirt but the sizing runs very small and the sequins are not attached as well as they could be and only go around the front half of the skirt. Maybe the sizing is junior sizing. I am a size 4 and couldn't get a small over my hips.",3
437692,"I ordered the queen size of these tights just to be safe and they run SUPER small.  They're really long and narrow without much stretch width-wise, it's pretty unattractive.  It's almost like they were built for someone who's 7 feet tall.  For reference, I'm 5'8"", 150 lbs.",1
345488,"The jacket is perfect, and I LOVE how it looks - but it RUNS A SIZE SMALL, so make sure to ORDER ONE SIZE LARGER THAN YOU NORMALLY WEAR! Other than that, it's a great material, I love the cut of it, and the arms are a perfect length. A great purchase overall, and I'm really glad that I bought it! It's everything I have been looking for, and more!",4
874214,"I purchased a size up so that it would be extra flowy since I'm curvy, but it doesn't flow at all. It fits me like a long tank. Definitely not made for plus sized or otherwise curvy women, at least not if you're going for the flowy effect. Still and awesome top.",4
77683,"Runs very small. Pre pregnancy size I was between a size 2 - 4 and so far only gained 18 lbs. nearly starting my 3rd trimester. When I tried it on, the Velcro belt only closed at the very end with no room to expand. Assuming a medium would fit just right fastened half way, but with 3 1/2 months to go, I think will exchange for a large and hopefully that will work.
Shipment was super fast. Got it within two business days.",4
359817,I wear a size 14 shoe so I ordered the XL.  The socks are huge.  I put one on my foot without so much of an iota of stretch to fit as it should.  There is no way the socks I received are fit for the intended purpose.,1
677919,"I just received this a few days ago, and it's a great picture of the ship I was on in the Navy, called the ""USS Hancock CVA-19"".  I had a T-Shirt with a picture of the Hancock in Disneyland, back around 2001, but it only showed it as it was in WW2.  This shirt shows how it was upgraded, and I was very sad that the Hancock was destroyed back in 1976.",5
403252,"I was very pleased when this item arrived before the expected date, and even happier when I saw the quality of the linkage in the necklace.  I wanted this to wear a pendant on and it is the perfect chain for this purpose.  I wouldn't hesitate to order from this group again.",5
148677,"I purchased this to sleep, I am not pregnant; its difficult to find nightwear with a bra type shelf. I usually wear a sports bra and a nightgown. I was hoping the material was soft and would easily slide around in bed. The material is not, it is thick, stiff, has a great bra type shelf. Also has an annoying side seam which will drive me nuts while sleeping. This is not a good choice to sleep for the finicky sleeper. A good day dress at home. Not worth the $$$.",3
581948,"I always wear a beanie when I run or workout, but I had to stop wearing many of the beanies that I have (damn you Chargers), so I bought this beanie, so that I could swap out the patch with literally anything that I want.  I always buy XL flex fit hats, and this fits my head perfectly.",5
141411,"I love the purse... However... the smell or should I say ""stench"" is so bad that I cannot use the purse. My husband and I have tried everything to get rid of the smell but have not had any success. Although the price was good I can not recommend this. I cannot use the purse the smell is embarrassing. Money wasted in my opinion",1
419134,"My order came on time and everything was there in the package. I love wearing these and am comfortable. The only problem I had with them was the o-rings irritated my lobes and made them itch, so I just switched the rings out with different ones. I haven't had a problem since.

Good product, easy to just put in and go.",5
69033,"I like the shoes, but I wish they had info. on sizing. My son is in size 5 usually, but in these he needs a 6. They are too small. The tags they come with actually say to order a 6 for his age. That would have been helpful to see that when I ordered them.",2
175651,"Eye holes are too small for effective vision if I were to try to get around and about. I will probably try to enlarge them. My intended use does not require much mobility; I intend to use it for ""monster"" figure poses -- to photograph for use in later drawing and painting of story illustrations.",3
316819,I never had so much trouble with trying to return a product.  It was not sewn completely and to send it back I had to pay for the return.  I think when a product arrives flawed Amazon should pay for the return postage.  I just eventually repaired the hat myself.  I will never again buy from this company!!!!,1
402462,"I always buy them, they are priced competitively and are great base layers. I'm 5 7"" 135 lbs and mistaking ordered XS, thus sent mine back for size S and it's a perfect fit. I can't travel to cold climates without them, they keep me warm and toasty. Absolutely love this brand, it's the best, only better at twice the price would be Patagonia.",5
261748,"This is perfect for my 3 year old grand daughter.  Just note that if it breaks, all the pieces will be loose and easily ""eaten"" by little babies.  She has a 9 month old brother crawling around, so these are kept away and only used to go out.  Not at home.  They are adorable.  The lady bugs are adorable.
Service was great.  Delivered promptly.",5
457360,"This is a checkbook cover, yet the way the seller listed the product, it's asking me for ratings for shoes. I find this to be a perfect alternative to the cheap plastic checkbook cover the bank gives you, and since I can't find Star Wars checks anywhere, at least I can keep them in a Star Wars checkbook cover.",4
126880,"I ordered theses suspenders for my son to wear in a family wedding. My son is 16 months old, 32 inches tall, and weighs 24 lbs. They arrived quickly and were as described/picture. The suspenders fit him very well. They were easy to attach to his pants and stayed secured throughout the afternoon. We got numerous compliments on how adorable they were and how handsome he looked. I would highly recommend this product. We would consider ordering again if the need arouse. Overall we are highly satisfied with the purchase.",5
659150,These shoes are the cutest. They go great with her Easter Dress. I'm glad I read the other reviews... I ordered a size smaller and they fit perfect. They are wide and that's perfect too be ause my Glam Baby has a wide foot. They DON'T look cheap for the price. Thanks..,5
16101,My stepson wore it on the day of Bat Mitzva since ladies were not permitted to wear Tallis.  My granddaughter loves it and uses it in daily prayers.  Thanks for timely shipping so it could be worn on her special day by her stepfather.  I think that it helped create a better bond between Stepfather and granddaughter.  Thank You!,5
282586,"I love this bag. It is perfect for me to take my swimsuit and gear to the Y swimming pool. Our friend put a velcro patch to close the bag opening, and this is a good feature. The bag quality and the designs are awesome.  I am four years old. ANNA",5
204926,I'm small so I don't mind the fit being a little bigger. X-small would have been great but the color is better than the picture. The flowers are almost a blue gray and found blue-gray with black panties at another store. So overall I say 4 stars for almost perfect but nothing is perfect!,4
417131,"This is a great all leather belt. The composite belts fall apart very quickly.
A big factor in my rating is the fact that it is made in Canada!
This isn't quite as described, there is some decoration on the belt. Not much, but it isn't smooth all the way around. It is hardly noticeable in my black belt.
It is a design of holes about 1/4"" diameter with brass inserts in them, and it is repeated several times. It looks good.
I would have bought this anyway if I had known.",5
514786,"Very high quality garment with tactilely-pleasing fabric.
The denier (and thus feel) is different between the lower and upper halves and both feel great.  I've never seen hosiery with this feature and it is done seamlessly (literally) -- like the rest of these tights, very well constructed.
My girlfriend says they are some of the most comfortable and best-fitting hosiery she has ever worn.",5
788657,Probably the nicest overseas amazon merchant I'll ever deal with. If you order anything from them that doesn't fit just message them directly and let them know. They are SUPER nice and ready to make you happy with a deal or a refund/ exchange. Very relieving as the clothes do run small so sizing can be a challenge to get just right. Size up 3 or 4 sizes if you want added room and length. Material is soft and beautiful. Well worth the price.,5
252943,"The main piece slides too easily on the headband, but that's easily remedied.  The headband clings without too much pressure, so I don't get a headache from it.  My husband said it is attractive, so I may buy another color soon.  The size makes this ""hat"" easy to pack for a journey.",5
224260,"i was very surprised by the quality of the material . Very good quality better than what you would get @ most costume stores . I was also very surprised by how well it fit, I am very narrow on the top with 36C & and smaller waist but Ive got some junk in the truck , the dress fit really cute and with some boy shorts under it will totally work for my Halloween costume without being too revealing . Loved it ",5
290858,"I bought this item but the material is very cheap and felt like it would get loose on me on the first wear.  The top it much shorter in person.  I would not recommend it to a friend.  I am about 165 pounds and curvy,  5ft 7. bust size 34B.  i purchased the medium.  it fits but as i mentioned earlier the top is really really short.",1
581115,"Love the idea of this product.  They are great for sunny stroller rides when you don't want to have to put both sides of the canopy up and cover baby's view.  Beware if your baby has chubby thighs--they will run small in that region.  My baby's thighs are beginning to become thicker now (though not chubby), and they are becoming more difficult to pull up.",4
232096,This workout waist slimming trainer is AWESOME! It's comfortable & it does stretch some so you may want to get a size smaller or email them for an acurate size best suitable for you. The whole order process & the time frame for delivery was great. I sent a few emails asking questions & received a response back immediately & with positive feedback. I have no regrets & I hope everyone who's looking for a comfortable workout waist slimming trainer make this their purchase.,5
110675,I can not rate this item because I never received  this necklace. Hoping to get it soon.  I wanted for a gift for Christmas for my niece  I went out and got her something else. Hoping I get it for her birthday that is coming very soo,1
75672,This was really useful when I was still able to fit in my shorts and pants. Not only would it cover my unbuttoned pants but would cover my tummy when I would wear my regular tops. No incidents of it folding down/up/ It stayed in place everytime I used it. The only downside is it gets hot when wearing it during summer.,4
106904,"It's pretty. The elephant looks like it is pictures. The chain itself could be a lot nicer. It's not really a chain as much as a cord. It seems very breakable? The hook thing gets stuck, so I have to be careful with it, but it's still a nice necklace. My friend will be happy with it. It also shipped VERY fast. Great shipping. Especially on such short notice during the holidays. It came in this cute little pink box with a silver bow on it. Lovely packaging.",3
190926,"Apart from an annoying habit for the receiving clasp to come loose from the band when opening it, great product at a great price. If I set the clip reciever so that the watch wears slightly loose, the problem vanishes, though I prefer a tight watch. At a few bucks, shipped, I'll deal. It might just have been my particular unit anyway, as some reviewers think it's just fine.",4
72291,"These shoes are adorable. My only frustration with Crocs is their sizing. My daughter is between a 9 and a 10, but the 8-9 are too small and the 10-11 are too big. I would prefer if they ran one size at a time like most shoes so I could buy her the size that actually fits. Other than that, the shoe is great!",4
158307,"This is typical american drivercap of good leather qualitiy without lining.
It fits  rather wide than long faces, where it comesdown to the ears.
The whole makeup is much larger than other caps.
I would very much appreciate the leather tarnish instead of this glossy surfave.
It is what it says - a Driver Cap.",3
76226,This is a great piece to have in your pregnancy wardrobe. I wore this throughout pregnancy and even after. The band works nicely while you're in transition in and out of pregnancy. It helped to extend the wear of my regular non-pregnancy bottoms which essentially saved money on having to purchase pregnancy clothes.,5
272948,"not quite sure how sterile the jewelry is due to the fact that they all came together in a small plastic bag. needles are sterilized though.i don't recommend self piercing even though ive done it myself twice but its a good,inexpensive kit for those of us with zero income or self esteem issues. i pierced my belly button out of fear of judgement in a piercing shop.",4
737263,"When it arrived I was quite excited but when I took it out of the package the ring was flattened. Although I was able to open it back up It does not fit well and it could be just me but it looks more vibrant in the picture. I am a little disappointed with the craftsmanship, I do not believe it will hold up for long but I will wear it for as long as it last.",3
611496,they came and look like chiwawa dogs. they do not look at all like a cat. my daughter was upset she wanted it to look like the picture.  and most the trouble is trying to send them back. they only want to pay back half of what i paid. and i ordered 2 of these.,1
224802,"The hat seems to be well made, however a little disappointed...the goggles are a baby blue color instead of the silvery color in the picture. Seems weird that they wouldn't keep it the same as that is what I was expecting and paying for. Good thing it's just for Halloween.",4
219303,"Not sure if it was a sizing issue but I had to return them.  My daughter is 5 years old and on the small side, yet she couldn't get her fingers through the holes.  This caused a melt down and I sent them back.  The gloves themselves seem like great quality but now I won't know for sure.  I hope this helps?",2
167769,"I thought these pants would be great when I put them on thy fit wonderfully, however, after 2 washes and 2 yoga classes the color is still bleeding. After every time I've worn them my hands and feet are completely pink and what's worse is today they completely stained my favorite cloth yoga bag!",2
28947,My original thought was... I've worn out my stock inserts so I need a replacement. The shoes are still good. I had no idea that an insert could make such a huge difference. I run a lot... over 100/week. I spend a lot of time on my feet. I've only used them twice so I'll update this after they're broken in but simply couldn't wait to tout the quality and difference these puppies make.,5
798360,"Works perfect. We just moved in to a new house with a pool so I needed goggles for me and my family. This is great to use, doesn't fog, fits snuggly, and easy to adjust. Made of very high quality material so it doesn't scratch easily. I have used this a few times before I wrote this review and still works fine. I received this item on a discounted price for my honest review.",5
132960,"The earrings are gorgeous, petite, and very well made.  However, the backs are very hard to attach to the earring posts due to their small size.  My wife had to use backs from other jewelry to attach the earrings to her ears because of the small size, and, she had a hard time manipulating the backs onto the earring posts.  She kept dropping the backs on the carpet making it difficult to find.  A different back needs to be recommended.",5
793597,"I am a 00 in shorts and a 32A in the top but I took a chance and ordered the swimsuit anyway because it is very cute. The bottoms fit, but I had to tie them very tight to wear the knot I made had some of the swimsuit bottoms in the knot if that makes any sense. The top fit as well, but probably would have fit better if I had bigger boobs ahah, still looks very flattering though. 10/10 recommend this bikini, very cute.",5
157975,"WAY larger than i was thinking it would be. :( But, it is very nnice and the quality seems (especially the chain) to be very good.
*To compensate for the chain length, that let the piece hang all the way down to just above my belly button - by doubling the chain up twice around my neck (and twisting it around on itself.) NOW ITS RIGHT WERE I WANTED TO HAVE IT AND WEAR IT AT! :d",5
73429,"Omg this wrap saved my back and core after the baby. I noticed a huge difference in how sore I was when I came home compared with the other two.  This was by far v the hardest time I had healing since she's my third and I had my tubes tired.

839440,"A sweet little skirt made of a strong cotton material. Hits below the knees as you would expect a skirt from the 50's to do. The print and color is rich. It fits as expected. I am 5'6"" 128lbs and ordered a medium. I will add more pictures. I am happily surprised with the quality of this skirt. Super cute to wear to weddings and other occasions. I received this skirt at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. I am very happy with this skirt.",5
242347,"Solid, solid, solid choice if you are looking for something that looks similar to white gold, is beyond comfortable, won't scratch like gold, and won't tarnish.  At a fraction of the cost, the only thing not to like is listening to my now wife tell me how she thinks my wedding band came out of a cracker jack box (I can assure you, the only thing cheap about it is the price, the quality is 5 stars).  Save yourself some money and get it.",5
788847,"I could tell from the pictures the top would be a hassle. But it definitely was in person. Too many adjustments and straps and it STILL was too large. I was disappointed because the bottoms were so cute and fit perfectly. I ordered a size Large. I'm a 34C, 5'4"", 150lbs",3
548638,"This item is much to small it was suppose to be a xxx l, but it was actually a size small. I had one of my friends try it on and she is a size 6 and it was to small for her as well. I will tr to sell it or maybe put it in the closet. The clothes from your store run very small and I wear a size 16. That is the reason I can't wear this vest. It is a nice vest over all though.

Thank you

70782,"These shoes were cute and arrived about 10 days after I ordered them. However, I ordered a size smaller then my son wears (ordered 3) and they were still about a size or even a size & 1/2 too big.  The only problem I have is in the advertising, there should have been an explanation of the sizing as these were purchased for his school year.  he will not be able to wear for at least another year or year &1/2!",3
316015,"UPDATE: I originally really liked these.... the problem is they stretch a lot as you wear them. The other problem is they smell terrible. I figured after they were washed a few times it would go away but it doesn't. It is gross. I was planning on buying more of these but I just don't think I can with the smell. Also, These are comfy but they do run small. Im Normally a 10/12 and so I got the 12/14 and they fit decent with a little gap around the waste. I normally swim in a 14.",3
55464,I could not be happier with these shoes. I typically wear an 8.5 but got a 9 and it fits just fine. They are the perfect mix of cute school girl and badass punkster. Also easier to walk in than most high heals because with the platform soul the incline is really not that steep.,5
340634,Bought it on June 18 but both zippers are not zipping already. Also the back of it is flexible & not good for your spine. Tried to return but the site is not letting me saying it is too late now! If I only knew it would stay only for 2 month I'd never bought it!,1

The only negative thing would be that the ankle does stretch out after a while and then you need new ones.",5
320277,"Product arrived on time, looks like what picture shows. I rated it 3 stars for two reasons. The chains on each strand twist around each other very easily and is hard to fix unless you take it off to undo the twisting. The second reason is the chains easily tarnish with normal wearing of the necklace, within 2 days of wearing it, the chains were no longer the vibrant gold color as shown. Though you if you don't mind the tangling and discoloration happening, it's a ok piece of jewelry for the price.",3

161859,"oh this product is just so great i'm having a hard time wrapping my head around the joy!!!
usually, in a case like this, you're paying for style, comfort, and necessity.

will i enjoy my outfit?  10/10",5
233807,Its actually pretty hard to find spaghetti strap onesies! My daughter was a flower girl and the dress was sleeveless. I didn't want the dress to rub on her skin but I didn't want a regular onesie under the dress so these onesies were perfect.  I used them often under her tops and the cute lace detail added to the outfits.,5
639159,I usually wear US size 4 but I ordered US size 6 and it fit perfectly. The shipping was really fast too. I really liked the style and I was very excited to try it on but when I did it looked pretty but somewhat cheap and the material was slightly itchy. There were few threads that weren't trimmed correctly but I guess it can be fixed. Overall it's OK for the price,3
781761,This bracelet is better than I expected. I bought it for my boyfriend and I. It's very comfortable and durable. Some bracelets I would take off when I'm sleeping but this one doesn't bother my wrist at all. The three middle beads are beautiful. Vibrate color and the art within the bead is abstract looking. I recommend buying this for your loved one. My boyfriend was very happy to receive this bracelets. (Not to mention the packaging was cute and saved you time on gift wrapping!),5
843968,i love this purse organizer after getting really mad about digging in my purse all the time so i decided to order this purse organizer and i must say i love this thing. it has so many pockets that is very versatile to use and everything is organized to my liking. some cons i see is is if you have a lot of items its gets heavy to a point where it can rip but other wise i love my purse organizer thanks. i received this product at a discount rate for my honest review.,5

819482,Love this suit! I'm a pear shaped body so I bought the large expecting the bottom half of the suit to be on the smaller side (usually I'm a size medium) the bottom was still a little snug but the top was too loose. I liked it so much I decided to keep it and try to get it altered to fit me. Hopefully it'll all work out:),4
353843,"I loved this soooo much. I didn't buy it as a navel ring. I have in my lower region ;)
Anyway, I bought one and put it in but didn't realize the bottom pearl was removable as well so I didn't tighten it. Well it fell out in the shower that same day. However, I did love the way it looked so much that I bought another one to replace it. Now both balls are tightly secured and I'm happy that my little clam has a pearl ",5
373560,"These are super cute! They are the EXACT same quality that you would get at a local tattoo/piercing shop, except they are much cheaper! They are 16G, so that's something to be aware of since a lot of people look for 14G.

389167,"I love this bag. It is the perfect size for what I need.
And my mom was so impressed with the quality of the purse that she is thinking about buying one for herself.
The color is a little darker than what the picture is. The pockets are spacious and the zippers are sturdy.
The added bonus is that if the bag does get dirty it can be washed in the washer. I did detect a very faint smell of plastic when I opened the package but a few spritz of febreeze took care of it.
Over all I love it.",5
302479,Very lovely ankle bracelet.  I was excited to receive it earlier than the estimated delivery date.  It is a nice gold color and accents my ankle.  Living in a warm climate sandals and flip flops are worn most of the time so ankle bracelets help dress up the barefoot look.  I am completely satisfied with this purchase and will be recommending this to my friends and family.  I am so happy I purchased this ankle bracelet.,5
851426,"I just had a c-section and losing for dresses that are comfortable until I heal. I ordered three of these after receiving the first. Super flattering postpartum and fit as expected. I am 5'5, 120lbs pre-pregnancy and after delivery 140lbs. The small fit perfect. Great to dress up for work or ladies luncheon or wear with flip flops. Won't disappoint!",5
634466,"These run small. I'm a 26 or usually a 4 or 6. I ordered the large. They are small-ish. I might have been able to get into a medium, but they'd be super skin tight. These are VERY low-rise and short. The quality seems ok with the exception of the zipper. Overall, worth the price.",4
545235,"These hats are so warm that they can be worn with a lighter jacket (for less bulk) on some fairly cold days.
I got this hat for my husband to wear because he has such a big head and this came in a large enough size for him - he loves it",5
66674,"I am very pleased with this purchase. First of all, its a fantastic deal. It came quickly, and nothing was broken or stripped. I was surprised that every single ring was different. I mean, some are very similar, but no ring is exactly alike. I'm sure some of the plastic balls will bust, but what can you expect with plastic tongue ring balls? Plus, now I have 100 replacements.",5
689245,"But this last minute for a trip to the beach. Absolutely love it! Super cute, plus the waste adjusts so that it doesn't have to be the perfect sizing for it to work. Cute enough to wear to lunch directly off the beach. Definitely buying more for next summer. Price is right!",5
119354,"I got the item earlier than what it said when I ordered it,but anyway,,i like it but when I tried it on last night that's when it happened,i put it on,and it was working fine,then just before going to bed,of course I took it off,and then it somehow snapped,well one of the metal connectors got loose, so I had to look for it and put it back,but I have to buy pliers just to tighten it!",2
581187,"I have had this for awhile and really like it because it was different love the hounds tooth print, I have even found a hat to match.  Just wish the sleeves were a little longer.  This is not something you can wear in the Mid West during the coldest winter months.",4
662670,"These aren't the pants pictured. These seem like they made by children in some factory. The top is NOT fold-over. There's a slim piece of elastic in the waistline, not flattering and not fold-over like yoga pants at all. These are too short on me and I'm 5'4! I ordered a Large and these would fit a 10-12 year old girl.",1
448882,"This dress made me feel like the prettiest girl in the world. It was beautifully made and fit like a dream. I've worn many evening gowns, but this one turned heads like crazy. I loved it so much I didn't want to take it off. The staff at edress it ensured that I received in time for my ball and their customer service was the best! I will continue to do business with them. Thank you so much!",5
811440,"I love this top! It fits true to size. I got a lot of compliments wearing it to work. I paired it with a pants as well as a black and white pencil skirt. It looked better with the pencil skirt. Only one issue I have with it is, its shorter than I expected. This can't be worn with a low waist jeans. This is mostly a skirt/ pencil skirt top which you could dress up or dress down.",4
161461,"The watch is fine but my brother got it damaged. :\ They don't really care about delivery I guess. Arrow that counts seconds is all messed up, going up and down.

I even took to the watch maker and he told me better not to mess around with it. So I'm dissapointed.",2
768721,I'm confused about these Chinese measurements. They are quoted in CM and you have to convert to inches for your measurements but it still doesn't add up. These Chinese measurements are too confusing something they're small another time they're too big. The color is also way off it looks more like a deep royal blue. I was disappointed.,1
358827,"These are cute but probably not worth the money compared to the cheaper mittens from Kushies. The velcro on these mittens is designed to keep the baby mittens from falling off.  This is really not the problem we have had using cheaper baby mittens with our baby, it's that they're difficult to put on to the baby's hand.  We thought looking at the image that the velcro would enable a larger hand opening, but we were wrong. If anything, these are more narrow and more difficult to get on the baby's hand.",3
867852,"I got a variation of this outfit, but not the one pictured. The pants were striped, so now I have a striped top and striped bottom. There is also no aqua in the top, therefore the pants don't actually match. Ive been satisfied with this brand each time before, but I am disappointed this time.",2
359381,"Quality excellent, size ""Large"" wasn;t. You should list sizes by calf  circumference AND shoe size.
I only wore 1 pair of the 3 pr I ordered: the size was ""Large""and I Did manage to get ot on, with difficulty. The foot part was 2 sizes too big.  At the end ot the day I had a terrible time getting them off because they were so tight at the top of my calf (I
m hefty but not obese)  I bought a different brand, ordering by calf size, and I am looking forward to their arrival.",3
645744,"My daughter really likes these boots because they are super cute and easy enough that she has no problem getting them on and off herself (she's 5). The only reason these aren't 5 stars is because her playing on the playground had already scuffed off some of the brown coloring on the toe after just two wears. Not a big deal as the structure of the boot is still holding. Otherwise, a great boot!",4
310704,"Its to small which is too bad im 205lb 5'7""  n i got a 2x. In the pics it looks like it really long but its not as long as i thought it was gonna be which is disapointing. Great quality tho! I couldn't find a size chart so i went off of the coments and its to small like 4 or 5 inches to small :/... n i didn't know it ships from china which would make since why its so small i normal am a large not a 2x..",4
219389,"My daughter is 5 and my son had a plain black pair of these that they call ""Shark"" gloves because it looks like shark teeth I guess with the fingers sticking out.  WHen I got these for her - she was so happy.

They are good heavy material so winters in Iowa are not an issue.  They are not waterproof though - so don't expect that.",5
72004,"So cute! Two things to be aware of: 1) The bow tie is a little difficult to put on. 2) Don't go by their (the seller's) weight on the sizes. Our son is 3 months old and around 13-14 pounds and the 3-6 month is just slightly baggy on him.  Other than that, the material seems to be good quality and it looks just as adorable as in the pic!",5
869050,This would have been a five star rating if the sewing to line up the stripes were matched up. Also the black thread hem looks a little tacky against the bottom stripe being that the bottom of the skirt ends in a white stripe but then has black thread running through it.,3
275287,"This belt is ""The Cat's Meow"" !!!  It took all of 5 minutes to unpack, figure out how it works, size it and wear it.  It is really neat, excellent quality and far sturdier that I expected. Fair price, fast and reliable shipping along with a superior product. It really doesn't get any better than that.",5
47814,"I was a jester in a play and these tights looked great for my costume.  The colors were brights and they were durable enough to last all performance week.  If I went to my local costume shop, they would have been priced 2-3 times the bargain I found here.  Now, I'm glad that I have them for the next Mardi Gras.",5
341975,Obsessed with my mesh body suit! I am 5'4 and about 150 pounds W/ small waist and (D cup) I got a medium and it fit perfectly! I would not say it's to small but it does fit very snug! It does have some stretch to it! Wish the clips on the bottom were not made of plastic but over all I love it and came super fast!,5
665128,"I wore this once to a festival and got many compliments, its cute but I wouldnt wear it unless I going to the beach or to a festival, the material is kind of plastic-y but other than that its true to the image, I definetly suggest ordering a size or two up if you want the proper fit.",3
355988,Cute shirt it's a little on the smaller side tho but that just means to go up a size or 2. I usually wear a medium but I ordered an XL cause my bust is big and I don't like my tummy showing in perticular so if you want it to show go one size up if you want nothing to show unless you lift your arms go 2 sizes up your normal size.  I'm 5ft2 125 pounds 36D bust 28 inch waist and 40 inch hips (:,5
689777,"I love this dress! I really loved the design and wanted one with sleeves. The material is nice and thick. The waist is higher than I expected, but still cute. I will say that if you are well endowed like I am, the bodice is pretty tight, so you might want to wear a cami underneath or just expect to show off the girls. :)

559892,"The turtleneck itself is REALLY nice construction/material-wise. The colors are pretty, it feels great. However it runs 1 - 1 1/2 szs small. The only way it would be as baggy on my (I am a L) as the pic is if I got an XXL, which is not an option. I'm going to try to wear it as is, a little small & see if I can get away with it without sending it back.",3
625315,"WE LOVED THIS!!!! we used it to announce that we were having another child, and it was pure awesomeness. waiting for everyone to actually ready the shirt was a blast!!  wee announced this to my grandmother on her 77th birthday which was also one heck of a gift for her. bought the shirt in bigger so that daughter can wear it longer ( we hope!!)",5
20319,My son has a big head. At 8 months he was at the 80th percentile for head size. We ordered the size for 2 year olds and it works great for him. He hates wearing hats and always tries to take them off but needs one for extra sun protection. This stays on with the strings and... he forgets about it in a few moments because the material is so light. Love it!,5
552690,"I am very happy with this hat. I live on the Great Lakes so you can see the need for warmth. It certainly has that. I can throw this hat on to walk the dog or dress it up with a button or broach for a more fashionable look. Either way..dressed down or dressed up, it works and its warm.",5
33364,"these were the longest pair i have tested so far, i have thick thighs.  these came over my knee by at least two inches.  no quite as far as i was hoping but not bad.  i only have a 28 inch inseam but my thick thighs make some socks a challenge",4
303086,"At 5 ft 6 inches and 135 lbs, I bought a large to ensure I got the floor length I wanted. I had to take off 2 inches from the length, but it was too tight around the waist and below the breast. Had to put in 2inches of fabric. Doesn't look like in picture, the top is actually white and doesn't have the detailed look. The skirt is total chiffon without a lining so I had to put a lining in. Delivery time was amazing. After alterations it is a nice dress.",2
661052,"I got these ties for my husband and teenager to wear. My husband has to wear a tie to work everyday, but I don't think that these ties are great for work. They are perfect for everyday use and even a night out. I love the fun designs and knit patterns.
The stitching is nice and they seem as though they will hold up for many years. I do wish that we could choose the colors and mix and match combinations, because I didn't really like the light colored tie in this set.",4
69109,"These shoes are great! They are snug, so a little difficult to get on, but they won't slip around on baby's foot when they get wet. We took them to the beach for three days and they still look and fit very good. I may buy the next size up for the end of the summer.",5
654579,"I ordered a size small and large because im normally small but it said order up two sizes, they are both the same size! But the arm holes on the large are bigger! Weird!  The print is pretty, i ordered the blue floral print, the fabric is thin, not of highest quality, you get what you pay for. The small fit me well, not too tight and dress hit at knee,  i will wear a brown thick dress belt to define waist. My measurements ; 32 bust, 125lbs, 5'2 and petite. I always wear a small.",2
22291,"Nice lightweight material.  I ordered white to keep baby cool.  I like the drawstring adjustment at the back, and that I can tie it on him.  I also like that it protects his neck.  Nice big brim, too.  Will be perfect for at the beach!",5
834236,"The shirt is slightly smaller than I anticipated and the way it's printed feels kinda cheap. Anytime I wear it everyone (other guys) says how awesome it is..most girls pay no attention to it haha or its so awesome they don't know what to say. I'm giving it 4 stars because it's a awesome shirt...I wasn't expecting crazy mind blowing quality, it's just a funny ass shirt.",4
856683,"sleeves are too short waist is too large. I am not sure why manufacturers always think that woman of size always hold their weight in their belly's. Sometimes we are more evenly proportioned. and we always, when ordering long sleeves, want our sleeves to go to our wrists, not leave a couple inches extra accentuating our issue of needing extra fabric.",3
876772,This dress is super cute!! It came in & I took it out of the box & the first thing I noticed was how thick it was. It not thick scratchy & uncomfortable but thick & soft & surprisingly light. It's very well made & a great deal for the price. I did receive this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest unbiased review & I have to tell you I was expecting something thin & cheap. I was very impressed with the quality of this dress & it's well worth the asking price.,5
723914,"It's super cute. It's summer time right now so it's too hot to wear so I bought a larger size suitable for the fall and winter season. I'm sure my son will fit it by then.
I received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",5
98041,"I didn't pay attention to the reviews before I bought this shirt. It definitely doesn't drape the way it does on the model in the picture. I'm not a fan of the workmanship since the seam on the front of the shirt is already coming undone. Basically, I have a small hole in the front shirt... The sizing does run large. The medium fits like a large. The color is not a fuchsia but more of a mauve. Not really even worth the money - around $12.",2
490359,"I wear a size 14 jeans so I got an XXL size thinking I would get a size bigger but it was  still too small. I would suggest getting 2 sizes larger. It is adjustable in the back so I can wear it with some skin showing but even with that it looks AMAZING on and would recommend it to everyone, just get a bigger size!!",4
166378,"The material of these were ok and not really to thin. The band is very thin and made loose rather than a tighter elastic, and because of this these kept sliding down. There's nothing I hate about leggings worse than to get a pair and have to go around tugging them up all the time.",3
674721,"My daughter loves this jacket! We ordered a large, and it fits perfectly. (She normally wears size 12-14 and is 5' tall.) Nice color and very fuzzy and soft inside. Just what she's been wanting. Was going to wait and give as a Christmas present, but she's outgrown her other coat and weather getting cool. Not too thick or heavy. Just right for school.",5
829986,I don't think I have ever gotten so many compliments on a costume before!! I am 5'7 and 140 lbs so a large was a good fit. It was a little loose but better loose than to tight for me! It is such a fun costume to wear. I wore Spanx Thinstincts Open-Bust Mid-Thigh Bodysuit under to suck in all the goods. It works with just nude underwear too. If you love sea creatures and the comfort of wearing basically a pj onesie...then this is the right costume for you!,5
338550,"I bought XL and they are TOO SMALL. I am 5'5"" and weigh 135 lbs. XL should have been on the big side, which is what I was going for since I have three children and am working on my figure. I couldn't believe that these were too short. They also don't fit like a compression tank should, there's no hugging in the right places...just a loosely form fitted shape to the shirt. Boo hiss.",2
392181,"Very nice bag. The zippers are a little rough and cheap, but I'm very pleased overall.

Edit: The zipper broke after six weeks. I don't even use it every day. I don't over-stuff it. The zipper split and, though I was able to move the pull it back to the open position, when I tried to close it again, it split immediately. The rest of the bag seems fine, but the cheapness of the hardware is very disappointing.",1
58319,"Bought these dress socks in 2012, only worn them maybe 10 times (I'm usually a casual dresser, short socks + sneakers) but the elasticity isn't great and they keep sliding down my calves and bunch up around the ankles. Maybe it's also because they're slightly too loose (for reference, my shoe size is 6.5 and calf circumference 14"" on one leg 14.25"" on the other). You get what you pay for; I'm going to invest in better socks now.",2
420521,This dress looks great (you can't even tell it's a nursing dress) and makes nursing super easy (especially in public...not having to fight with a bra while trying to keep a cover over you with a squiggly baby is nice).  I bought another one in black b/c I liked this one so much.,5
21522,"We love the i play brand!  We have always purchased out swim diapers/suits from this company so when it came time to buy a hat for our new little I came straight them!  The hat keeps the sun off her face and neck and when her head was tiny, we could pull the drawstring tighter.  Very lightweight and seems to breathe so her head isn't terribly sweaty in the heat.",5
526504,"It is a little too big but thats what I wanted. The fabric is very soft and light weight...which is what
I needed. I have nylon nightgowns from another company but they are thicker and can be too warm
for our Fla. weather. The colors are very pretty and just like the photos.",5
408554,"It's real brass and has a nice weight to it, as well as some scrolly details -- I run a homeschool educational co-op and gave it to my Registrar just for fun. :) Shipping was fast. My only complaint is that the pin is really thick, also made out of brass I think -- so she couldn't put it through her clothing because it would have left a big hole. Otherwise,nicely made.",4
77260,"Let's start with what I liked: The fabric.  The lace is not at all scratchy, and has nice stretch to it.  The sizing is right on.

Now what I didn't like: The crotch lining is a wink and a nod at best.  And the cut of this is... well, for something labed a ""boxer short"" rather than a ""boyshort,"" it's overly friendly to my butt, and I didn't care for that.

They do look nice, and I imagine I'll wear them for special occasions... but they won't become a part of my daily wear staple wardrobe.",2
85973,"I ordered one size up because I like loose pajama pants-I would recommend it. They are very long and the crotch is low but all in all they are perfect for lounging. However, the material is very thin and it wears through kind of quickly (the crotch region for me), but in the end it was a good purchase.",4
335282,"I bought this when I thought I lost my original tam. It's identical to, and the same quality as, the tam that came with my regalia (that cost a ton more). It fit, and looked great. Of course, after wearing this one, I found the missing one, so now I have 2.",5
539193,"The PJ's looked just like the picture.  They felt wonderful and washed up well.  But I was not able to wear them because the bottoms were way too small.  I wear a medium and these were sized at XL, but I could not get the bottoms half way up my legs.  I guess if you are a Chinese they are sized right.",3
326569,"I bought black. Made of jersey which is nice. Soft. Will be wearable after washing, because it smells out of the pkg. Sizing is off at least one size. I normally wear a 20 so I ordered a 3x hoping for loose.. No way, snug as heck. I'm keeping it because I like the cape but will cut it off a few inches and wear it as a top with a black skirt. Go 2 sizes up unless you are wanting to show every bump and curve.",3
445658,"I was 100% sure that I ordered Pink and Gray combination, but I received a Peach and Gray. Althought it was little bit damaged (there were few stitches missing)  I didn't returned it because the peach matches one of my handbags. I have similar scarf, that's why I thought the quality will be same. It is soft, but not as much I expected for 15 dollar scarf. It came very fast.",3
3148,There is a information problem in general for the size of this insert.  I had to cut it in half to make it work.  Now I have two. The inserts are getting a little beat up already.  The fix would be for me to get the wallet that these inserts were made for.  Otherwise the product was shipped promptly.,3

225971,"At first, it was very ""fluffy"" and made my bottom look huge. But a lot people commented that they loved how I dressed and that I have cute skirt. I started to develop love for my skirt. It was a little snug on me, probably because I have a ""muffintop"" haha. I ordered a large, I believe. I am 5'6"" and around 150-160 lbs.",4
409076,"I have to say, I just ordered my second one of these. We've had it for three years and it's still amazing!

298595,"Received in a timely fashion and wallet was as described. Color is very nice and it does hold a lot of cards.  The fold on the expansion part is a little odd though, and it seems if you don't set the cards in just right, they stick up.  It may just be that the leather needs to break in a bit.",4

If you give them your right measurements they measure just right nothing else at all. I'll give it a 4 out of 5 , I would give it a 5 if the boots was Black just like Eren boots.",4
447830,"First off the anklet does have good bling.
The problem is the bracelet is far too big to be an anklet. I bought it for my wife and it just falls down to her foot.  The elastic should be tight enough to have it stay on her ankle.
She has a normal size ankle she is not a twig but she doesn't have cankles either.
If this would fit right it would be 5 stars for the price.
I read other reviews that said it was too tight, wondering how big the are.",2
304190,I love these sports bras. The only downside is that they run small. I normally wear a small in a sports bra but I read the reviews and ordered a medium. The medium fits but is still pretty snug. If I order more I will try the large to see if that is a better fit,5

The crotch of the bottoms is really long and doesn't provide the right coverage. Maybe that's what they thought high wasted should be, but it's not wearable.

The size is an issue that can be very simply aided. It might fit perfectly over another beanie.

overall, I am impressed and satisfied with the product. It also arrived earlier than stated, right before Christmas!",4
192534,"They came packaged nicely and were easily adjustable and cute. However, after a couple days of having the gold one in, my nose started getting irritated and then it started hurting. When I took the ring out, there was rust on the end of the stopper. I won't be wearing these or buying more from this seller.",2
825091,"Color is very  light, and the fabric very thin.  I didn't feel comfortable wearing this. Every detail of my bra could be seen. Although the fabric is very thin, a darker color hides the details under the tunic. I purchased one in navy and I do like it.",3
831568,"This is not the same bracelet as shown.  There are NO cubic zirconia gems.  It is simply plated gold.  Also, the size is NOT for women.  It is a tiny bracelet that a little girl might wear.  I am so disappointed in this item and feel like I've been duped.  Don't waste your money!  I will be sending this back.",1
6247,Pants fit as expected and they are extremely comfortable.  I removed the hammer loops and I love having a small pocket on each side of the pants.  This is one of three pairs of Carhartt pants I have purchased and they are all wonderful.  I wanted to get away form cargo pants and these definitely hit the mark.,5
336657,"Gave it 3 stars, the outfit is cute HOWEVER the smell is truly unbearable. I am going to try and wash it to see if it goes away but after the first wash it still has that strong chemical smell. Disappointed because the outfit is nice but with a smell like that I am not going to be able to wear it until it goes away.",3
450166,"I had high hopes for this jacket when I first ordered it. It has a nice finish and blocks the wind but seems to short at the waist. Seems like it rides above the belt line, too short. The zipper seems to be flimsy that allows you to zip in and out the liner, does not go back in easily.

Likely made for the smaller Chinese market and not meant for import.",3
132358,"At first when I looked at it, I thought it was too large. But, it is perfect. I have already washed it once. I hung it to dry (which I do with most tops) and it looks just as good. I am going to order more in different colours. Very comfy and easy to wear.",5
23586,"Easy to get in and out of western boots. I wear a wide shoe so I wish the middle and toe part could spread to fill out the boot. Never the less boot keeps are hard to find and are holding the boot's shape.
Nice well-built wooden product. I would re-purchase. Good price too!",4
707357,I always buy stride rite and paid more than I should have for these to get the right size but I'm a little disappointed with the quality. After a few wears the fabric around the top of the sole is coming off and for what I paid I didn't expect that to happen after a few wears.,3
868656,"I got the ""ash"" color, the Android and ""apple"" are the iron-on type and its shininess makes it so the apple doesn't really come across well.  The one I got doesn't have much of a stem either, so it looks more like a burnt meatball.  The Android should definitely be 50% larger.  Quality of the hat is nice, but I'll never wear it because I'd rather not keep explaining what it is supposed to be.  The photo looks much better than reality.",2
29999,"Don't know what it is but these hats are the perfect ball caps for my head. I don't usually like wearing hats and an very picky about them, but these are great quality. I have lots of colors in them now. I had some of them embroidered. Wear them all the time. I especially like the little distressed look.",5
791908,"I am always worried about fit when buying on line, but this large fits well.  I am large, a 16-18 usually and this shirt is just right: Not tight, with darts in the front and back to fit it to a woman's figure.  The material has a nice hand and washes well.  Looks great right out of the dryer, no ironing needed to look sharp and professional.",5
854949,"I really wanted to like this, but it was way too small for me.  I ordered the size I normally buy and couldn't believe it was too small.  You all always in the past have been really good that is why I continued to order from you.  But I may try it ordering again.",2
263725,"Great product. I have several in rotation on my Seiko divers!

Addendum
My watches now fall off without notice. This is alarming to me. I treasure my watches and cringe at the thought of one dropping and breaking or God forbid, going down an abyss.
The prong slips out unexpectedly from the buckle, especially once it gets wet. This is unacceptable.
I just received new Natos from another company.",1
860205,"I'm very happy with this one piece,for the price its pretty sturdy fabric.
I'm 5'6 and 135lb I got the Large as I have a larger torso and pretty big on top. 34DDD.
It doesn't leave much to the imagination but I don't think its made for women fuller on top but it has removable inserts and the straps are adjustable, so with some adjusting it works and I feel quite secure.",5
336184,"The tag on the side is the worst it is big and stiff so it makes weird lump on your side. I removed it and BAM a hole appeared right there after 2 washes, no I do not dry in the dryer. I won't re-order this one but I would by from the company again.",4
835582,"This is yet another piece of amazing costume jewelry from a manufacturer who does excellent work. It has good weight to it hangs properly, the dome over the graphic lends an illusion of depth of field, and the photo simply doesn't do justice to it. The artwork is beautifully and subtly shaded; it has incredible detail for a basically black and white illustration. And I received it from China in two weeks. If you like the photo you will love this necklace, as I do. (And no one paid me or gave me anything to write this review.)",5
4545,"The robe is the correct color, feels fantastic but it is huge.  My wife is 5' 4"" tall and 115 pounds.  She wears a Small in everything she has.  The shoulders would fit a linebacker and it wraps around her twice.  If they had an extra small I would return it.",2

I have a belly, am 36 C, and a big bottom as mentioned and I am thrilled with how it fits. It's really cute!",5
144643,These earrings arrived with the paint overlay peeling off of them.  Where is the quality control?  The rest just looked like a cheap mess with crooked posts and dull coloring.  Thankfully I was able to return but I wouldn't recommend taking a chance that these will be worth your time.,1
216588,"Although I like the black fabric under the brim and the shape is pleasing (unfortunate, though, that it's only one sizeit was too small for me), this is not that great of a hat. If you find a bunch of these in a store maybe it would be a better buy, because you'd be able to pick and choose to find one that's not all dried out and cracking, or folded and screwed up. The latter is a byproduct of Amazon's random shipping, but the former is definitely a quality issue with the hat itself.",2
560923,"I love this dress. I am 5'4 and 130lbs, and it fit perfectly. I think it would fit US sizes XS to L, unless you are super tall, because I think that it would be too short if you were more than like 5'8. The colors are a lot more vibrant than I expected. I love it. I am so happy I bought it.",5
211593,Ordered size based on US size description and fit was as expected. The quality also as expected for the price and it being a chiffon top. Did take a bit longer than most amazing products to ship but that too was expected based on tentative dates given by the seller.,5
241210,"Purchased this for my wife as a backup wedding band to wear when working out in the garden,yard, etc. This ring is a surprising value and looks and feels like it would be much more expensive. The fit was spot on the same as her wedding band. I would recommend.",4
150772,"I really love this dress. The material is very nice and comfortable. It does strech.
I would recommend to buy it a size smaller because it does come a bit big. I got
a Large and I think I should have gotten a Medium. I still kept the large because its
not that loose on me. But I would recemmend to buy a smaller size for sure. I will be getting
this same dress in black but will for sure order a medium. Nice dress for anykind of ocassion

It fits okay but the material is of very bad quality and does not hold its shape. After only one wash as per their instructions, the border started curling upwards. I wouldn't recommend buying this to anyone.",1
669862,"Comes from china, had I realized that before I purchased it I wouldn't have bought this.  All the clothing from china runs extremely small.  This did fit but is really poorly made, the liner is really short and stops at my waste.  I will have to wear shorts with this.",1
169645,"OMG!! I bought this watch for my musician son's birthday. He loved the steampunk look to it and the music notes on the watch face. It has a nice looking band that is like a leather bracelet. He was very pleased and it looks really nice for the cost!!

439957,"Not very happy with the top on this one. I'm 5'8"" 135 and a Vicky S cup size 34D. Ordered the large. The shorts fit perfectly, but the top is too big. I had to pull the string super tight to get the cups lined up where they need to be, and since the string is only on the front half, the sides are bunched weird. I'm sure a smaller top would fit better, but then the shorts would be too small. I would also NOT classify this as a push up. Just a cover up.",3
476112,"Grips well.

However the strap it's replacing had a slider in the back that I could adjust to either be tight to help hold the glasses on during vigorous action (wave runner, for example), medium, so that the glasses would rest high on my chest when off, or loose, to hang lower, which is the only option for these.  I suppose I could put a knot in it to simulate medium and a rubber band might suffice for tight, but that seems like ""tape on your glasses"" nerdy.",3

I read that my problem may be my foot arch. I searched the internet for information and decided to purchase this product. Boy, was I impressed with the results! In 24 hours 75% of my back/knee pain was gone. I ordered a second pair to install in another pair of my shoes!",5

It still has the tags on it.",1

86395,"So the outfit itself is cute, however, the hemming is all crooked on the bottom of the skirt so it runs along the white part. I have to unhem it and redo it or take it to someone so it looks better.  PLUS the skirt is not blue and gray as it depicts in the picture, it's white and blue.  You get what you pay for I guess.  The item came alot quicker than it stated it would.  So that's good.",2

669566,"This was a cute idea but the product is a total waste of money. The fabric on the shorts and the plastic material are very cheap. I put the shorts on and it immediately ripped right below the butt. So I got out the sewing machine, sewed it back together and within 20 minutes it ripped again. It would be better to charge more and have a product that would last through the party.",1

670456,The US sizes and UK sizes are different which is what we use in my country so I winged the order but it fit just a bit snug on the arms but otherwise it was great. The top was not as denim as I expected it was the softer lighter denim and not that used on your standard jeans in the 80s but it worked,4

That's quite a large jump in sizing, but I really liked the shirts.",4

Overall, the material of the dress was a little stretchy, leading to a nice hug to the body, and came down slightly past the knee.",2
305070,I love this hoodie. It has to be the best hoodie I have ever had. It is a great fit. As a taller person it is hard to find hoodie that get longer without getting wider. I am 6 foot 3 and got a xxl and it fits perfect. I love how soft it is and that it is not bulky like a lot of other goodies. Overall I think I have told my wife how much I love this hoodie every time I put it on.,5
201690,I would like better packaging so I can keep them organized in my wardrobe. like a glass box or something so they don't get lost instead of the flimsy cardboard box they come with. I use them often tough. I use the two lighter ones more much often than the others. BTW the material seems it could take a beating. They are well built.,4

I hoped so much that it would actually look like the picture and fit well. This company was beyond prompt! When I opened it, it was so beautiful. When I put it on, I almost cried. It fit perfectly. I cannot wait to wear it for my most special day! I feel beautiful in it. Everyone I have shown adores it. The price is outstanding and amazing considering the service and dress I received!",5

The posted picture does not capture the color brilliance of the greens, oranges and especially the background turquoise contrasting colors.

I received multiple compliments.",5
45925,"I usually wear a small and after reading the customer reviews, I decided to purchase a medium and Im glad I did. To me the medium fits as if it is a small. Im 5'4 and 120Ibs. It is very form fitting so if you're wanting something somewhat loose, I would even consider a large. The material is really good quality and the shipping was fast. I received mine in 2 days and only paid for standard shipping. Mine shipped from a city in Kentucky. It glows in the dark really well also.",5

It came in a short amount of time i would say about 3-4 days good thing too i was rushing to get my cosplay finished before anime expo 2015. It also fits for all sizes and im not a skinny or slim person i so thats a plus. The apron looked like it came straight from the anime/manga i love it and it has velcro so its pretty adjustable.,5

After trying it on once, more of the lights came out of the holes in the sweater. At the actual event where I wore this, only four of the lights remained in their original place. Also, there is no pocket or holder for the heavy battery pack so that kept dangling free inside the sweater causing some of the lights to fall off.",1
299364,"Great suspenders.

The combination of somewhat stretchy material, using Velcro to adjust size & the plastic grippers have perfected suspenders, finally.

The stretchiness of the straps keeps them on your shoulders while sitting.  I've always felt very uneasy sitting before this change.

The new grippers never fail.

The Velcro lets you make fast, easy adjustments as needed.

Perfect.",5

If you're small like me I would say go for it.",4
866032,"Love these shorts. Not a fan of the long shorts as they are far too restrictive for the type of workouts I do.

522915,The actual look is different then the real charm It is not pretty at all. It's a clear color with the design but the back up is not white which make it very unattractive. I have being fooled.  The charm  is a clear crystal color with the design on it. While the computer shows a white glass with the colorful swirl but the real charm is a crystal clear Murano with the swirl design. Not pretty at all.,2
313532,"As described and looks great and was priced very low so all in all I'm happy with it, just with the back/bottom was a little fuller, as you can see in the picture its not a full bottom, but at the same time not a thong so it's takes a bit getting used to. but still a nice purchase",4

The blue: horrible fit all around. Bottoms too small, mid waist band was bigger then the top and bottom, maybe if your an apple it would fit and the top was sewn crooked. Besides that it had a white lining that shows big time. The white I would buy again ... The other two mehhh.",4

366524,"You pay for what you get- but this is definitely a nice jumpsuit for what you paid. In the picture, it looks as if this outfit is made of cotton, however, it is more of a rayon- polyester type of material.
The material gives, which is good for those of us that may be fearful of the outfit being too tight around the thigh and stomach area. I was very comfortable in this outfit and received many compliments. To maintain it, I would handwash it or have it dry cleaned.",4
461052,"This black & white striped cover up is beautiful! The material is very soft and silky. It feels and looks much more expensive than the price. This is a bargain! It fits perfectly around me and knotted at the top to create a cover up, although there are plenty of ways to wear it. I used it for a recent cruise and I received many compliments on it. I highly recommend, and I will be purchasing more in different patterns!",5
233768,"Got these as a gift.  Love that I can grab my phone in the night and finally see my phone even when I have no idea where my readers are.  They fall off my nose when I smile, and I always smile, but as long as I can stay serious...these work like a charm.  So glad to have them!!! Great invention.",5
526621,"I had looked all over for long flannel nightgowns without buttons down the front. This one is not only button-less, but also warm, full fitting, and comfortable. I never did like anything up around my neck at night so the v neckline is perfect. And length is perfect for a shorty like myself. I got 4, one in each color. Well worth the price.",5
315117,It is a circus act trying to get in it but once you get it zipped it looks amazing! I'm an XL in regular clothes so that's what I got and it's a bit of a struggle to get on but not bad. I have 2 kids so I have the mom pouch but this makes it all go away.,4
773238,Tried this with skinny jeans and 1) at many angles it made me look pregnant 2) I normally appreciate a long top but this is too long for me. Hardy shows any of my booty in my cute skinny jeans. Fun sleeves but returning as they are not worth the price.,3
459787,"Doesn't look anything like the picture... it hits way to high and not on the waist, which isn't very flattering.  It was also a lot smaller than I'd expected it to be.  I will never wear it but it wasn't worth the price of sending it back.  Another casualty of online shopping I guess!",2
333051,It looks just like the picture. I purchased the black. Wore it to a themed tea party bridal shower. I wore a bright dress with bright pink lip stick to give it some pop since it was a bridal shower not a funeral! I received lots of compliments. Very well made and looked elegant. Price was excellent! I did not want to pay too much for something I may not wear again and this was perfect! Shipped within a couple of days!,5
340371,"I did not know I was going to be receiving a surprise thong with this. Anyways the garter is a big big being a size 16. Other than that the quality of the material is good, and it looks just like the picture. definitely sexy and would totally buy again.",5
816778,"I think this dress is great! However, I did NOT listen to previous reviwers and ordered my nornal suze medium. That was a mistake. The fit looks great on my figure but was too tight in the arms and I couldn't even get the zipper all the way up. I am 5'6 150 lbs and the dress can right above the knee on me. I love the vent in the back.  I will return it and order a large this time.",5
67762,Great costume! I found neon blue fishnets at the dollar store to complete the blue tights look since they are not included. I ordered a medium thinking it would run small (since costumes often do) but this one doesn't. I usually am a size 4 or 6 depending on the clothing maker and I had plenty of room in the Medium and probably should have bought a small.,5
136656,"I bought this product because I wanted some retro bottoms to a retro top I already bought. I ordered a large even though I am usually a medium. The bottoms fit great! The top did not fit, but that was to be expected as my chest is not as large as my backside. The quality is good. The suit is cute. The shipping was quick. Overall, a good experience.",4
793481,"The dress pictured isn't the dress I received. My dress looks very quickly and cheaply made. It came with strings hanging off of it, loose pearls, it has a black spot of the front of the dress and the back has a section where there is no bead work at all. Not a happy customer at all. Save your money...huge disappointment!!!",2
283074,I read most of the comments on this bathing suit and most people sized up. I am 50 and weigh about 148lbs. I usually wear mediums but bought a size large in with this bathing suit.  I went one size up because Im usually a size up bust wise. The bottoms are a little loose in the tummy area but not too bad. Definitely worth the price and its so cute for women with curves right?,5
559797,"This sweater runs small !!!! Glad I took the time to read the reviews and ordered the sweater in XL,normally I wear a MD . The sweater looks fine on and its pretty. Just wish they would adjust the product for US sizing.  Took a whole month for the sweater to arrive .",3
354465,"This suit was a failure. I ordered a large, since everyone says it runs small, but it's still very small in some areas, while somehow running large in others, for an overall dumpy, barrel-chesty, unflattering effect.

I started the return process; seller promised to refund 50% of my shipping costs. Shipping it back to China costs around $30, so even half of that is more than I paid for the suit. I'm not about to waste any more money on it, so it's going in the Goodwill pile.",1
694101,They are not that ideal for a newborn as the slip off. I bought these because the ones with elastic never stayed on but we are having the same trouble with these. They need more velcro so you can tighten them a little more on tiny arms and hands. They will def work once our little one gets a bit bigger,4
256971,The color was a perfect match to what was advertised and the fabric was a good quality especially for the price. When I put it on the bottoms fit perfect and looked nice. My only complaint is that the top has zero support to hold up my huge 36G boobs. I think this would be perfect for someone with smaller boobs.,4
830056,"Very cute dress. The jersey fabric has a nice drape and not tissue thin. Well made, the stripes line up on the side seams. Washes well, although do not dry in the dryer because this fabric will shrink. Don't go by what size you usually wear, follow the size chart provided and the sizing is accurate.",5
593047,"My only complaint is that in the stock photo, the shirt appears to be a lighter shade of green with a darker shade around the neckline and in person it is actually a bold green with the ninja turtles being the same color as the rest of the shirt's fabric (the outline of the turtles is just darker, so they are still distinguishable).",4
165553,"Comfortable and stylish for dressing up or working out at gym ! I am 5'7 at 151 lbs I usually wear a medium and they fit true to size, won't slide down. . Love love love! Purchased heather gray fit perfect in medium-purchased black and they were a bit snug. A definite size difference in black I will be ordering a large.",4
348670,"I'm a CNA so taking gloves on and off all day kinda makes this ring uncomfortable for me since the band is same width all the way around. However, it is beautiful and I wear it all the time! It arrived earlier than expected and looks just like picture. Have gotten lots of compliments!",5
394211,"These bras are so comfortable and give me the coverage and the lift (without an underwire) that I was looking for! Although I've purchased multiple nursing bras in various colors, patterns, and designs these have quickly become my go to bras. And the price is AMAZING! I've spent much more on bras that have been a complete waste of money and let down (no pun intended. hehe!). But speaking of let down, they have also saved me a ton of embarrassment because they are thick enough that they don't show leakage when I've forgotten my nursing pads.",5
680724,"Too small so I ordered a bigger size.  The quality is amazing and they are so light weight.  My son said the cushioning inside were ""awesome!""  The memory foam works wonders.  They appear to be narrow in width, which is what I wanted.  The best shoe ever!!!",5
735696,"Totally cute! I got this for my girlfriend who I met online.
She is from Ohio, and I am from Nevada.
We finally live together and this shirt was PERFECT for her and our relationship because we were in a long distance relationship before we moved in together.
She loves it and cried when she read it!
The size was a size too big, but it's okay because it's 100% cotton, and is expected to shrink. :)",5
479243,"This necklace was not right for me. It looks wonderful but unfortunately it is quite stiff. I put on just one Pandora charm. The necklace laid flat if I kept my hands down by my side, but the minute I lifted my arms up the necklace flips up. It's a shame really because it it really does look beautiful.",2
387822,"I picked up the light blue for our simple courthouse wedding, and I paired it with some blush pink heels, so cute!!! I'm 5'6, 128ish pounds and a 34C. Even with a padded bra the medium fit fine. I also ordered the navy dress tonight as my now husband loved the light blue so much. Also the model must be pretty tall as the dress isn't that short at least on me. Can't beat this dress for $22!",5
674734,The tie is beautiful and looks better than the picture. I was very happy when I received it and would recommend it .  Shlax&Wing always have outstanding merchandise and I always enjoy ordering from them.  A company the always has great customer relations and service. A great company with integrity.,5
633115,I am very upset with this product and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they have a small figure or bust. It was too tight in the bust (I am a 36D) but I expected it to be more loose. It was tight in the arms and it was just a terrible buy in my opinion for my body. I ended up selling it to a friend.,1
514468,"I bought this for my mom for Mother's Day and she loves it.  It's a unique charm to add to her Origami Owl necklace.  And it also came with a free pearl charm for her necklace as well.  As both coffee fans and Starbucks fans, we think this charm is adorable!",5
669933,Horrible dress. It fit way too small and the zipper on the side broke while trying to put it on. The sizes run smaller than actual size. I bought a large and it fit like an extra small. And I'm not a big person. I actually wear medium but purchased a large to fit over my bossoms. Will return for refund.,1
712641,"A little smaller than I thought. Would suggest to buyers to buy one size larger than they wear. Also I was expecting a cotton shirt all around, the outside is silky which I'm not a big fan of. My first time wearing it its already pulling and getting messed up where the guys black shirt is. Might want to mention that to customers as well. As far as the print that was great, really enjoyed it. The thickness was a little less than I expected but no complaints on that.",3
536547,"Four cami tanks for a good price. They seem to be no better or no worse quality than most cami tanks, but the price point is far better. Only note is that the white is pretty transparent, even with the shelf bra, so you'll definitely want to wear an actual bra with the white one!",4
138736,i love the print on this but it's a little shorter than pictured.  it's a one size item and i wish it were offered a little larger because i like the length in the pciture- but it's good quality and i still wear it. it's not too-too short so it's long enough but i just wish it had been a little longer. DO NOT put it in the dryer though- line dry this one :),4
12954,"These are great for those who have planters fasciitis or other foot problems.  I had a serious problem in the arch of my foot, and my husband suggested trying these Orthotics.  They are firm but not hard.  And they don't have the type of foam that absorbs foot odor.  My husband has used these for years.  I just started using them.  My only suggestion would be to buy a new pair with each new pair of shoes.",5
17690,"Wanted something simple and sparkly and perhaps to layer with other jewelry.  These were fairly inexpensive but don""t look it!  Have worn a few times now and love them although I will say that they seem to be slightly on the tight side, VERY SLIGHTLY.  Maybe its just the warm summer months though....",5
177354,I needed a dress for my baby shower and seen this was very cute and looked comfortable. When I received the dress it was indeed comfortable but the fabric was too thin to wear to the party. If it was made with a slightly thicker fabric it would have been perfect.,2
784196,I LOVE the feel and quality of this outfit! I bought this as a gift for my niece and am so impressed that I think I will order some other clothes from this company for my daughter! The fabric is so stretchy and soft! Do they make this in adult size!?,5
415080,the design is correct but it is not centered and on the whole side of the shirt. It is down more and to the left. It will have to do because I need for a Christmas present and it took forever to ship which left me no time for exchanges! So its just ok but I am not really happy :I,3
339493,"It fits true to size. Like others have mentioned, very small pockets. Not a fan of the shape very much. I like to zip a vest like halfway and show my cami underneath. When you do this with this vest, the top doesn't spread, it looks as though it is completely zipped.",3
820577,"I bought this wallet chain as a replacement strap for 2 purses with bronze hardware. The chain is a nice aged bronze, well made, the links are soldered making them more sturdy. The chain thickness is between a #2 pencil and sharpie marker. The extra clips are great for purse or wallet charms, ID holders or keys. Very pleased with the purchase.",5
696153,"This is a beautiful case but it is very hard to.press down on the side buttons to control power buttons and volume control. Also the phone charger port cover is not good. Once used the port stays open and does not close; it hasn't broken off yet, but it will soon due to poor quality.",2
735906,"As in the present, we don't use them yet. However, the size of the tags is large enough to be detected easily. Also, they look so cute that they catch people's attention for sure! Anyway the product seem to have a great quality. The cost is worth for great quality!",5
444456,I normally a size 5 but after reading reviews I decided on a 7 .. And I couldn't even get them on they look like they were made for a toddler .. But that would be my only complaint they seem like they would be comfy if they were the right size,3
46374,"I was surprised about the quality of this frame, it was pretty flimsy, not tight at all, some cheaper frames that I had felt better than this one. Does not feel it should cost that much. I would have kept it though if the style worked for me but it was slightly different from what it looked like on the picture.",3

----Update 12/22/15----

All I can say is this is an awesome band! After wearing it about a month it hasn't come off my wrist. HIGHLY recommend this company. It is far superior to the last company I ordered from. Get lots of compliments on the watch as well.

If you are are in fence on whether or not to get this for Seiko 007, just go ahead and order now.",5

Overall, i'm happy with my purchase and the fast shipping.",4
15419,"We spent $35 at the doctors for the identical brand, but actually a cheaper version.  Needing a second pair, and not wanting to fork over another $35, we went on line and found these.  They are great and the price even with shipping was a fraction of what he was charging.  Highly recommend.",5

5159,"These are my first pair of Carhartts. They fit a bit snug at the waste, but loosens a bit after some wear. The fabric is strong, but not harsh to the touch. Beware of the technology pocket!

Also I couldn't see in the picture, but the legs have ""I'M A DREAMER"" in gray randomly on the sides, and it was honestly an unexpected surprise.",2
713543,"The coat has a ""suit jacket"" fit rather than a casual fit. My husband needed to adjust his expectations, but once he did he loved it. The only other negative is that it had only one inside pocket as opposed to the two advertised. Also, the zipper is on the left, which bugs him a bit.",5
340435,Bought this to wear to a festival coming up. This is perfect sized and fits really well on the head. Also is super bendable in order to form to any hair style you may want to rock with it.

I love the little gem and decorative metal framing it. unfortunately, I have lost mine :( but it is great and I am considering buying another one in another color and hopefully my other one will turn up :)",4
663830,Sadly this suit is a bust. The tie was different. The vest was different.  The material looked nothing like the images.  Very thin. Almost like a costume tuxedo. Size was way off. It was huge! Was hoping my husband could wear it for our vow renewal ceremony but it would look like we got it at the flea market. Better off renting one. Seller is in China so doubt I will ever get my money back. Wish I had read the reviews first.,1

I always find that they run a little big at first then they seem to grow out of them before they fit in the next size right.

Reason, the windshield blocks the rays. Transitions don't work on the amount of light in an area, but the amount UV light/radiation hitting the lenses.

These were cheap, so if they scratch, break or get lost, they're easily replaced. To meet the low price, they aren't made with the best of thickest material.  But they work.",3

405741,This skirt never fit my first lady apparently.  We recently went through the lingerie cabinet and this skirt that I though fit her well was in the trash pile.  I asked why and she said it never fit.  Xl didn't fit her 16/18 frame and booty.  Oh well,2
561101,"SIZE ALERT - This is coming from China and is in Asian sizes.  DO NOT GO BY THE SIZE CHART which is provided by Amazon.  I am a US Men's Large.  This shirt is WAY WAY too small.  If I had known it was coming from China, I would have ordered an XXL (Asian XXL is USA L).  VERY DISAPPOINTED - I am going to attempt a return but given the international nature of this product, I expect trouble.",1
187406,"It is a good quality product but my husband was a large man and usually he fits into an XL with no problem, but because this shirt runs small he did not feel comfortable in it. My suggestion is to go a size larger than what you think you are.",3
474494,"My daughter absolutely loves this dress! It is beautiful and very well-made, and the fabric is very high quality. I was originally worried about it not arriving in time, but it actually arrived a month earlier than the expected delivery date with plenty of time to spare. Thank you so much to Honeystore for this stunning dress!",5
701013,"Got what I expected, material was kind of thin, but kept him from getting too hot since Mother Nature decided summer shouldn't end in the south just yet. Boy was happy, didn't cost as much as some of the local Wal-Mart selections, didn't disintegrate within 5 seconds of opening. I'd buy again.",5
631538,"Overall the costume was what I was looking for expect for the size. I ordered a size medium (typically I'm a 6/8) but the size fit like an x-large. The sleeves, waist and length all need to be taken in. For the future I would have ordered an x-small or at least small.",3
836376,"I ordered a small, I'm 120lbs size C in bra.
It was very sheer, thin material(3expect for the price) and fit a little more loose that I had expected but I still like it.
I ordered a black shirt and they sent me a grey one. Took about a month to get here.
For the price is good,",3
443869,"When I ordered this item, I wasn't sure about the size. How surprised I was when I received it. This wallet is so roomy and easily holds all my credit cards; plus has an extra pocket on each side  for my driver's Id and gasoline card. Would definitely recommend this Vera Bradley product to a friend.",5
355859,"I hate this that shirts runs very small -  granted there is a warning on the listing, however...  I ordered 2 sizes up - just to be on the SAFE side.  what a JOKE..  a women's  XXL -  will fit my 12 year old son.  Just be aware, when they says - slim fit - runs small.  it runs EXTREMELY small.  It has a great feminine neckline.. and nicer than most ""unisex"" athletic style raglan shirts.  guess they need to make XXXXXL that truly equals a XL, hahaha.",2
358529,"I've had two pairs of these. The smaller ones worked very well for us. When baby outgrew them I bought a larger pair. The larger pair cut my baby several times, rather than preventing cuts.  The first time I thought it was my fault for not securing the velcro properly. However, it continued to happen even though I was diligent about securing the velcro properly. My baby woke up this morning, gloves secured, with a 1.5 inch cut on face from the sharp corners of the velcro strap.",2
382320,"Was really excited about the bag. Outside is great, inside the material sounds like paper and has ugly color and writing on the inside material. Really disappointed with that, but only paid 12 bucks for it so it was still worth it. I get compliments on it a lot, I just don't show the inside. You get what you pay for. Still cute",3
687291,"I bought a large (I usually wear a 12 and am 5'1"") and it fit really well.  The fabric is light but that is fine with me as I am wearing it under an open weave sweater.  It is not see through on me because it does not pull overly tight.  I plan to buy other colors.",5
851420,I ordered this suit for an upcoming trip. I am usually a 12 on the bottom but 8/10 on top. I ordered a large because the size chart indicates a large is a 12/14. I think it may fit my 10 year old. The tag on the top indicates a large is a 6. Sizing is completely off.,2
817345,"This bracelet is truly lovely. Ill cut to the chase...

Pros:  The colors, details, materials are all terrific. The magnetic closure is easy to use & felt very secure.

Cons: Unless you have small wrists this is going to be a bit tight/snug. Since there is a sturdy metal/magnetic closure on it, there is simply no give in it.

Bottom line: BEAUTIFUL but small.",4
454028,"This is a well made belt.  It will stand up to heavy work and still looks nice.  It does run large, though.  I ordered a medium according to sizing charts and have 14 inches left over after buckling.  The belt is thick enough so it cannot be passed through a belt loop twice.  So, I go through my work day with a piece of belt flapping against my waist. This being said, if I could purchase this nice belt in a smaller size, I would do so.",5
82303,"This nighty is lovely, even if the pink is lighter than shown. My problem is that A) I did not know that the cups were mesh as well and B)The cups don't...cup. Maybe If I lose a cup size or so I could properly wear it, but as of now the pretty cups are on top of my bosom. Would still recommend to B-cup size ladies or smaller.",4
701629,"What can I say about an inexpensive woolen beret? It fit just right, it matched the color in the ad, and it's clean, and neatly shipped. I would recommend any color from this selection. There is no leather rim, as in Basque Berets. It is just as simple as you would expect it to be.",5
190341,I GOT THIS DRESS IN A XXL LARGE AND IT STILL FIT LIKE A MINI SKIRT. I HAD TO WEAR BLACK TIGHTS SO IT WOULD NOT BE NOTICABLE. MIND YOU I HAVE BOUGHT A NUMBER OF DRESSES IN LARGE THAT REACH THE KNEE AS THIS DRESS IS PICTURED AS DOING.,3
102342,"They are really nice shirts.  my husband lets say is a little short & ROUND.  And sometimes I have to order 1 size larger then I really need and they hang off his neck and shoulders.  These shirts seem to be a little on the longer side and are long enough to cover the roundness.....LOL
Also the necks seem to lay flat not that rolled sloppy look.  This is the second time I order these.",4
586093,"Loved the colours this bag comes in. The ombre styles are very trendy. Initially received a lot of compliments after using it a few times,but then the straps started stripping in less than a month of having it. Really disappointed since I Wanted to order more colours in this style.",1
596482,"When I say somewhat small, I mean for American sizing. I'm aware I was ordering an item from Ireland, so I knew they might run smaller. So they are more like a medium in MENS for America sizing. But I really like them! Great color........they are not soft to the touch, but I think if washed they will soften right up. My boyfriend can not wear them, so I will give them to my son. Super cute. Fast shipping.",4
628535,"These things are minute.  My fault for not reading the dimensions.  They will fit on the upper part of your ear if you are lucky.  They don't stay on for me.  They're lovely to look at... with a magnifying glass.  They seem well made.  Seriously, if you have worn cuffs near the top of your ear before and they work for you I recommend these.  If not, stick to the normal-sized ones that fit lower on your ear, and always read the dimensions before ordering.",3
94794,"Nearly perfect product.  It looked great!  I splattered it on by throwing spoon fulls of it onto a dress shirt, and it looked great!  The only thing is it turned sort of pink-ish and didn't look too much like blood, but that could've been due to how I smeared other parts of the shirt with it so it'd dry faster.

Really good!  Just be careful with it in terms of skin contact, and don't use it on a piece of clothing you care about.",4
47735,"These are very uncomfortable,  they slip over your ears like ear covers, there is not a band that connect the two together and had I understood that from the very vague discription I would not have ordered them and I sure would not have paid as much as I did just to try them. Don't waste your time.",1
45036,"Material cheap but expected,  hat is extremely bent can bent it back (maybe with a heat gun)  shirt kind of  small  while the pants could fit on some one twice my size the gun hoslter? Wouldn't even call it that just a vinyl pocket
I would post a picture of how bad the hat it but don't know how to put a picture  up,  sad can't even wear the hat..",2
61832,"After my c-section, it felt like I had no abdominal muscles.  The binder I got in the hospital was way too large.  This one fit really nicely and made me feel put back together again.  I wore regular underwear under this item to hold a maternity pad in place but I'm sure you could affix the pad to this underwear as well.
I didn't wear it for more than 6 hours at a time to allow my body some time to relax.",4
97368,"This is a nice shirt, I received what I was expecting.  I probably should have ordered a size down, at least, as this is rather big on me.  The material is thick, and the color is what is shown.  Overall I'm happy with my purchase, but this will be a lazy day shirt or a ""fat day"" shirt.",4
688736,"Cute concept and shirt, however im usually a medium in shirts but i figured cause its japanese sizing (atleast it seems so) that id order a larger to be safe. The shirt itself wasn't tight , fight fine. Howver the sleeve was way tight and i could barely move my arms. Cute but yeah too small",2
348543,"This is such a pretty scarf. The color of purple is not quite as vivid and deep as is pictured but still lovely. Have received many compliments. These scarves would be the perfect gift to give for a birthday or perhaps a co-worker or associate for a ""job well done"". I plan to purchase more.",5
619232,I could deal with the fact that the dress gave me a uniboob because it was definitely a size or 2 too small but it was still cute after squeezing into it. The problem was that after wearing it a second time the outer layer of the skirt came apart at multiple different areas on the seem of the skirt where the stripes connect.,3
198016,"beyond what I expected to recieve. Real neoprene top and bottom, colors look just like the real triangl colors, and overall great quality. They were shipped in a box so the neoprene had barely any wrinkles. I ordered the size large (36c bra , size 7 jeans) and everything fits perfectly. I'm ordering tons more for this summer",5
268212,"This purse is not purple---it's a dark brown with a hint of burgundy.  The zippers are bright, fake-looking gold with large teeth spread far apart.  All in all, this is a very cheap looking purse which I'll be returning.  It's always good to check to see if items are made in China; it's been my experience that most things lack quality and aren't  anything I want to have.  I forgot to check this one before ordering.",2
521872,"This product is definitely cute for a Halloween party but it is really not worth it.  You will get a headache trying to blow it up (a pump or something is recommend if you have one) and the air leaks out like crazy.  It only fits about one case of beer/soda, so you really can't use it as your only cooler. I would recommend spending more money to get one of the larger blow up Halloween coolers.",3
149091,"LOVED the ring!  The quality was good considering the price I paid for it. My daughter was very, very happy with the gift. I really liked that the seller emailed me asking if I liked the ring and if I had experienced any problems with it. Customer service is so very important for return business - I would definitely use this seller again.",5
831667,"It is a lovely dress,is just not for short people I got it for my daughter prom, she is 5'2"" with curvy body. It was very tight from waist down and way too long. It's really beautiful and does worth the money, but just for this issue we Returned it :(",4
67871,"This bag is an exceptional value.  It has a roomy interior, side pockets, another pocket for my phone and, most importantly, a pocket on the back (good for passport, money, or other valuables).  I had a Coach bacpck/purse combo and it was too heavy for me, even while empty.  This one is big enough to carry an iPad, walet, cosmetic bag, sunglasses, tissues.  I live it!",5

At first i laughed Really thought they sent me a mans shirt
I thought ok i will just sleep in it But then the arms ran sooo small soooo
I ended up giving it to my neice",2
310979,"These are long enough even for me, and I'm 5'10"".  I ordered a size up because my size didn't have free returns.  A size up makes them more like sweats (translation - very comfortable), which is actually what I was looking for in fleece leggings.  They're too loose in the knee, though, and this caused some bunching up.  Still deciding whether to exchange for my size.  If they stretch any more they won't be OK for anything but at home.",5
838475,It's pretty. I wear it almost everyday is it's still bright and shiny. It has a good solid weight and feels good on my hand. I also like how it looks on my hand. I have short fingers which make it hard to get rings that are too small or too over powering. This fits the bill. will definitely be coming back for other items.,5
111481,"RIDICULOUS.... I ordered this product TWICE and BOTH TIMES it was missing the grey/silver mask.  I ordered it the first time and contacted Amazon.  they apologized for the mistake and offered a refund.  I placed the order again and selected overnight shipping.  Received the package on a Thursday (the party I needed it for was on Friday).  Surprise, surprise... the same mask was missing again.  The description when I purchased (and currently as I'm typing this) shows that the package is to include TWO masks as pictured.",1

There are times I can't carry it when I do need to cart around more than it's slim styling can handle which is a shame, but I still love the thing.  Thank you Bellroy.",5
28923,"I purchased these for my daily shoes in the hopes they would feel good and help with arch support. Unfortunately for me, they did not work and they caused problems in my hip area. I returned them to the company and requested a refund which they sent promptly. So while the product did not work for me the company that makes them stands behind what they sell. So if you are looking for something similar to this the money back guarantee might make it worth it for you to try them out and see if they work for you.",2
428060,"I bought several CZ silver bands on Amazon, from cheap to moderately priced and liked this one the best!  Looks the most realistic with great clarity and sparkle in the stones.  Comfortable to wear and a nice match to my engagement ring.  No one can tell it's not real.  Sometimes these CZ bands are too wide and features stones that are too big to be believable.  Can't believe with my expensive taste I picked the least expensive one!  Hopefully it will stay this nice....only time will tell.",5
695027,"So super comfy! I am not someone who dresses up frequently and my wardrobe usually consists of jeans and sweatshirt. After trying these on when they came I did not want to take them off! The fleece if so soft, they are comfortable, and they fit perfectly. I can see them being worn with a tunic on a date or being worn under other clothing to stay warm. Look no further for some great fleece lined leggings.",5
671089,"This skirt had so many good reviews, I decided to try it. I didn't like it. I bought it to wear in hot weather, but the material is not breathable at all. The shape is also not as pictured - mine poofed out right under the belt line and went straight down like a brick. Same diameter at the hips as at the knees looks very square. The pattern was pretty, but I returned it. Thankfully, no issues with return.",2
89918,My four year old daughter wore these adorable classes with her 50's poodle skirt costume. These classes were good quality and a perfect fit. She loved them so much she wanted to wear them on a daily basis. Now I'm upset because I hid them from her so she wouldn't take them to school and now I can't find them.,5
567711,"I really like the color of the dress, however, this dress is not ""knee length"" and it's definitely not something that I can wear to work as is. I also didn't know that there was a split in the back of the dress. Since the dress is so short, the split is a little high up my behind. I'm a true medium, but I have a lot of butt. If that's you and you don't like your back side showing if you bend over, then this dress is NOT for you.",2
854885,I love this. The fabric is nice and soft. It is made of swimsuit material. The color is as shown and looks amazing. I love The pattern. It is easy to put on. I could see if someone had very large shoulders/arms that it might be too snug but I don't know. The edges are stitched well and have a nice seams. I wore it without my swim suit top on and am thinking about wearing it as a dress. It is so cute.,5
239391,"This ring is the most beautiful stainless steel ring I have ever purchased!!! The design is exquisite and the quality is by far the best out of any ring of this type (and I have tried MANY!). My profession is rough on my hands and this ring holds its shape and the stones have remained intact and secure!!! I am very pleased with this ring and feel like I have FINALLY found ""The One""!!!! If you are searching for this type of ring, ordering this one first will be the best decision you could make!!! <3 <3 <3",5

525181,"It was a nice bathing suit but the logo was not the same as pictured. I get very annoyed when I buy something on amazon and they ship something ""close enough"". Something should be done about items not being what was pictured.  Anyways,  I am keeping it because it was still cute.",2
341972,"I sway from Medium to Large with bodysuits, but ordered this one in a medium because I read a review about it being big, but I love it. This was a nicer quality than I expected. I've worn it twice and it's held up so nicely and has yet to snag like other mesh things I own.",5
644426,"If you are hesitant about making this purchase...don't be, just buy it. Trust me you'll thank me later. I am so pleased that I took a chance and ordered this veil it is gorgeous!!!

353538,"Finally! some shoe laces that withstand the heat and spatter when Im welding. These shoe laces (a pair) are perfect for my work boots. They are long and fit perfect through the eyelet. Im a welder by trade but also do lots of construction work, so my boots go through a lot quickly",5
665791,these are so fun! I have so many people come up to me and either tell me how much they loved these back in the day and where can they order some too or many think it's a tattoo until they get close since I have a few tattoos. :),5
462434,cheap and ill fitting fabric. size chart was pretty accurate. not as white as the picture shows. the pockets puff out and have that weird slit in the middle. the collar doesnt hold up well. and the brown pocket makes it look even cheaper. i would consider ordering other items bc ive bought items ive liked in the past.  liked them... not loved them...,2
712839,I ordered the medium and it fits me perfectly as I'm 5'2 and 150 lbs. Looks exactly like the picture and flatters my post pregnancy figure.  The mesh and lace are nice in my opinion.  I don't care for the panty though but we both loved it as soon as I tried it on.  The band is stretchy too.,5

420935,"Soo beautiful and sparkly. I see these going for around $13 in stores, so this was a really great deal. Especially since I already had some necklaces for this pendant. It's been awhile since I've bought this, and I still wear it. I've just bought two in different colors for friends.",5
785850,This is a really pretty purse. I like that the liner is gray and not black - for easier seeing into it. I like the satchel handles and that it zips and has an easy clasp. The drawback to me is that it is really stiff and with arthritis in my hands makes it a little harder to search. For most folks it should be fine.  Perhaps it will get more flexible with use. I would like it a little smaller and with a wider opening. But it is really snazzy looking! :),4
210214,"Cute dress so I decided to buy it in two colors, a red one and a white one. It took about a month for me to get it in the mail, seperate shippings for both of them. First one I got which was the red one fit fine and was cute. Second one which I got in the mail was nowhere close to looking like the red one. The lining of the dress was longer than the lace, they sent me an extra large, it was just ugly.",2
164187,"I gave them 3 stars because they were actually pretty cute, but the quality is pretty poor. The nose pads rest in the corner of my eyes and one of the nose pads came missing a screw so that fell off soon after removing it from the package, but what can you really expect form 8 dollar glasses. As far as comfort, even with the poor placement of the nose pads, they aren't that bad. Everything that was wrong with them is a simple fix so I'll keep them.",3
253525,"I ordered the ivory/beige color which looks smart with the black edges. The lining inside is black. This wallet is a win considering the purchase is online and I didn't handle it first. Really well sewn, nice quality leather, and easily (EASILY) holds my Google Pixel phone which has a small case. One large zipper section and one small zipper pocket inside and whole thing closes up neat. The tassel comes unattached, you can clip it on if you like or not. I would order another of these in a different color.",5
250718,"I got a X-large. Thinking it would fit. But it runs small. It probably need like a XXX-large or XX-large to fit. I wanted to use it while at work to slim my waist. I would return it, but two of the hooks came out when trying it on for the first time. So I didn't.",1
166344,"These pants are too small.  I'm 5-8, 200 lbs.  They are ok, but the bum is too tight ( I know, I know, I'm working on it).  I decided to keep them, because I'll be able to fit in them pretty soon, right?  I do love the wide band at the waist.  I'm hoping to love them when they fit!",3
708618,"Loved this suit! We got so many compliments on the suit. Took our 6 month old to St John USVI, didn't need a drop of sunscreen when we paired this suit with Sunday Afternoons Play Hat. Suit was fairly easy to get on, loved the sturdy snaps at the legs for diaper changes. Suit dried easily, fit as expected and covered her completely. Highly recommend this product for anyone taking a baby to the beach that wants to avoid the use of chemicals.",5
768376,It came a week early and it looks a lot like the picture! Only thing is that it's not as big as it looks and the material is more stiff and not as flexible then it looks in the picture but  okay with that! It's very comfortable and I could wear it in the autumn or early winter!,5
655821,"The pattern on this is really cute and adorable.  Its sheer like described, and fits loosely. Overall, the floral print is ideal for just about anything and makes a cute addition to my boring tank top.  Dont have any negatives because so far its great.  Wore it twice with no issues.

I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for my personal and unbiased review.",5

Lots of storage and the handles are beautiful decorated. I can't wait to wear it out! Great price and fast shipping. To say the least, I will be purchasing at least one more in a different color in the near future.
Update: I loved my brown purse so much that I purchasd the burgundy one!",5
402501,Wasn't expecting it to look as good as it does. I got the xl size I'm 6'2 200 pounds and it's a little big but nothing crazy.  The helm is definitely cheap probably worst part of the costume but it doesn't look bad. Overall for 50 bucks I think it's a real fair deal.,4
864747,"The bathing suit itself is pretty cute. The bottoms were a bit smaller than I had originally anticipated. I din't mind too much but if you are looking for a full coverage bikini- this is not the one. I only used the bathing suit when laying out and tanning not yet for swimming. Overall, good bathing suit for the price.",3
708243,I'm wearing mediums 8/10 but knew this would run small being that it's made in Asia. Buy two sizes up. So glad I bought this dress. I'm using it for a Morton Salt girl costume. Also this dresses style is so adorable that I'll be wearing it for other occasions.,5
861405,"Beautiful dress, and my daughter really liked the stormy blue color. Fit as expected, maybe a bit big in the bust area, and corset back is a plus. We returned because she decided that she didn't want to go with a strapless gown, but this is a beautifully made gown for the price. Also, for reference, its a bit long. Shes 59 and it puddled on the floor",4
403046,"So pleasantly surprised!  The dangling crystals don't even show up in the photo here, and they are by far the nicest part of this!  So much nicer than shown.  Very pleased, looks great with my wedding dress and headband.  Do NOT spend $50-$250 at a bridal shop---this is just as nice as any beaded tulle veil found in a boutique at a fraction of the price.",5
237835,"I'd say it was a pretty good looking ring, the only problem was that it was too big. I had my fiance who hates wearing jewelry, sized at my jeweler. These rings may run big because i know he didn't lose weight. Just be aware of that if your size is an in betweener. I should have bought the 11 and a half instead.",4

527379,"I liked the look and fit of these pants when I first ordered them. However, I have only worn/washed them a handful of times (maybe 3 times) and the material has gotten all pilly.

441601,"I got this ring as an engagement ring for my fiancee (we kinda went against tradition and got engagement rings for both of us :D ). For the price, this ring is amazing! Yes, there is a line where the ""engraving"" doesn't exactly meet, but if you wear that part towards the back, you'd never be able to notice it. I got the ring very quickly after I ordered it, and I am very satisfied with it. He absolutely loves it, and he says it's incredibly comfortable.",5

The coat is light weight wool and would be nice in the fall however the fit is off. I generally wear a small, but ordered a size up.  The medium is nice fit in the body, but a bit snug in the arms.
I'm disappointed.",2
422081,"These are a little on the expensive side in my opinion for the quality.  They're not exactly everyday slippers however so that's not the end of the world.  They're a little oddly shaped.  They don't stand up like you see in the picture.  The material in the feet has no structure so it's a little deflated looking and the pointed tips fall over.

I couldn't find any other adult elf slippers so these were the only option, and for a random cute thing for Christmas they're perfectly fine.",3
49813,This item is cute.  I didn't return it because I ike fishnet but the way it appears on the model is not the way it actually fits.  The item is not full.  Instead it clings to you.  The only way it will fit loose is if you wear a 00.,4

785986,"Thought this looked cute in the pics but it's horrible. I burst out laughing when I opened it. I ordered an XL but it was soooooo short and wide! I'm not sure anyone could have worn this, not even with tights or a swimsuit cover up. The print on the material was poor quality too.",1
365653,"The claw was way to big, but i did love it, i live in Florida, so i bought  it to keep from  doing my own hair everyday, its quite  humid  here, so just wanted to keep my own  hair from constant blowdrying, the said part it lasted around  4 or  wears, you get what you pay for, but if you just need it for a special  occasion it's  fine",2

They are a little bit snug, but I think the next size up would be too big.  I haven't worn them for an extended period of time yet so I can't comment on comfort but my guess is that they won't be super comfortable. Very cute.",4
247251,"They are nice and soft, making the comfort level quite good. They do shrink some even when you hang dry them, but since I mostly sleep in them with pajama pants it's not a big deal for me. If I decide I want them under a sleeved shirt with jeans I'll buy a pack in a size up and they'll be fine. They were shipped lightning quick, and you can't beat the price. They are also tagless which is a huge plus as I despise tags scratching at the back of my neck.",4
178825,"I guess I can't complain, as the other reviewers were spot on about this product.  The thigh holes are a bit small, and the waistline is a bit big, doesn't have any kind of elasticity, therefore it kept slipping down a bit.  I don't foresee myself wearing this very often in the future...  I guess you get what you pay for.

Side note: doesn't work very well as a set being a large hipped woman with tiny bewbs.  The top was WAAAAY to big in comparison to my hip size that I needed to order.",2
605862,"The oiutfit itself is fine. I had in error received the wrong size. I am currently working it out with the vendor to receive a larger size. I will caution that European sizes are different from UK and US sizes. If you normally take a medium, it may be best to consider a large or x- large as they do run somewhat small....",4

The shirt fits perfectly. It does not run small so order the size you need.

I am pleased with this purchase. It looks nice.",5
455058,Reading these reviews aren't encouraging for a plus size woman and they're too conflicting. I saw this same blouse online for 8 bucks on another site. I'm wondering what the quality really is. I hate cloth shopping but I'll have to stick to shopping at retail stores for this headache.,2

I'm 5'5"" about 150 usually a medium & size 8 in pants so I figured getting a bigger size cause of my hips but it was a mistake, should of gone with a medium, would of exchanged it but the medium wasn't prime so wouldn't come in time for me.",4

I don't think of my chest as very large but I have natural 34C cups and when went for a run this morning I did notice them bouncing around wherever they wanted and causing havoc!

It fits nicely, too, and is true to size.

I do wish the cuffs at the wrist were cut smaller, so they wouldn't catch on handles and corners.",5

Just for sizing help- Pre-pregnancy I was 139 lbs, 5'6"", and now I am about 149 lbs at 22 weeks pregnant, and the medium fits me perfectly. I believe it will definitely last throughout my entire pregnancy.",5

The case is also extremely bulky and cheaply made. The Plus is already a massive phone and the case just makes it too large to get a good grip around the phone. The case also doesn't fit the phone very nicely, there are giant gaps for the volume buttons and charging hole. I recommend just bitting the bullet and buying a real lumee, the cheap knock off isn't worth it.",1

Plus I'm 5""2 135lbs, and the dress fits great, no need for any tailoring. To make it even cuter, I only tied one of the ribbons on one side to make an asymmetrical neck line. Love the orange belt too! Very worth it, its a unique dress.",5

I was very impressed. I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",5

116847,"They were a little long, however most things are for me as I am 5'3. However they are perfect because of that fact. I originally bought them to use as a cosplay (Leafa from SAO), and was shocked at how nice they are. I almost feel bad for turning them into shorts and false thigh highs.",5
731659,"Took a while to ship, but my main concern is that it came with many wrinkles in the leather itself due to how long it was packaged. I'm sure they can be removed with the right ironing/steaming technique however. It's not very slim fitting, but it's a great jacket nonetheless. I'm a 5'10'' skinny guy and a small fit me great!",4

But they are so thick that that even in my looser fitting shoes, they take up so much space that my feet are screaming for relief.  At the end of the day, it's more comfortable to wear my shoes without these inserts.",3

Here's her comment:
""Fit comfortably and look really cool. Looks stylish, feather light weight, high end quality!
I am so ready for my summer XD!!!!""

I got pulled away by her, so I tried on myself while she wasn't around; it is super light and comfort and the design is really unique and modern.
I highly recommend this sunglasses.",5

It's a unisex cut,  not a women's cut. 2.) The fabric is stiff, hard and scratchy and 3.) The screen print looks like a cheap iron on and it's discolored.

Polished finish has not been altered by the sand, the sea or any other factor you might find on such trips.

-The top puffs out a lot, and it's not a good look.

I wore this for a work presentation and it was very sophisticated but relaxed especially with the built in pockets. That was my favorite feature on the dress. The cut in the front was a little low for me so I just wore a cami underneath that gave the look a little contrast of color.

539141,"i love this dress but it definitely requires a slip underneath. You can see thru the top just enough. It also fits snugly. I would order again in other colors just a size up. I am 5'5"" and 130lbs and typically wear a size 4 so I ordered a small, but I think a medium would have fit just a bit more comfortably.",4
151038,"I got these for my husband, and was surprised they fit more like women's pants - a little tight in the leg and short in the crotch. Considering the photo shows a male model, I expected them to be cut like men's pajamas.  He typically wears a 32-34, so I ordered him a medium. Turns out I should have gotten him a large. They're just for wearing at home though, so he doesn't mind. They are very soft, and a good weight - lighter than typical sweatpants but thicker than standard pajama pants.",4

I was happy and surprised to find out that these rings came from Benchmark.",5
524443,Beautiful!!!!! I was worried it would be too large but its just right. What a unique piece of jewelry. It reminds me of warm summer days walking through the woods. I will definitely be buying at least one or two more. I stumbled upon these necklaces by accident looking for something for my daughter and I am so glad I did. The only suggestion I would make would be to show these necklaces on actual people. I almost didn't buy it because it looks huge in the pictures.,4
67556,"I received this ring about a week ago, and I am completely smitten! I have received an unbelievable amount of compliments. I am a nurse so it gets put through the works and is still holding up beautifully. The tag that was attached to the ring on arrival stated this ring was one $129.00- it truly is a steal.",5
789914,"I love these pants!  I have a curvier/athletic figure so most capri's I have a problem being too tight in the butt and too big in the waist, so then they like to slide down.
These stay in place great when I am running, and when I am lifting/doing squats.
I got the large, but might have been able to fit into a medium.  I prefer to have a little extra room though for my booty.
For a size idea, I am 5'7"", 154 lbs, I fluctuate between 22-24% body fat, 34C on top, 28 inch waist, and 41 inch hips",5
334213,Disappointed in the quality of the leather. The leather is just a thin piece on the top but the rest of the belt is padded with man made materials. For the price I expected the belt to be made only of leather. The design is nice and the buckle adjustments are quite easy and feel quite secure. Overall I feel as if the buckle design and quality makes up for the lower quality leather of the belt. Overall an attractive product.,3
502810,"I was looking for an inexpensive pair of sunglasses for vacation so I thought I would give these a try.  I have two issues when it comes to sunglasses, the fit and always losing them, ha!  These arrived today and they fit just fine, which I was thankful for.  I also must say that they look far more expensive than they are which is nice.  So I now have a nice pair of sunglasses for vacation and if I lose them along the way, Im not out an arm and a leg to replace them.",5
128627,The jacket fits well although it's a bit long in the arms (for me). I wish the hood could be hidden when not used. But I like that it has a mesh lining inside and is long enough to cover my backside. It doesn't have the same kind of shape as the Switchback jacket though.,4
335583,"Pictures are deceptive. The earrings will not stay up on your ear like the picture shows. You can turn them up as the picture shows but there'snothing to keep them in place. It would be great if there was pliable metal flap that you could clamp it to your ear at the top to keep it in place. If you want these, plan to wear them hanging down!",1
581769,"I received this product at discounted price in return of my honest opinion. This necklace is very pretty; a solid, quality product. It does not look cheap by any means. I like the ability to change the length with the chain and clasp. It is easy to put on and remove by myself, I do not need any help. I think this would look super cute with casual, business, or formal wear. I like that I can use it in any type of event. I do recommend this product.",5
590291,"love love this. i wanted a low profile and non leather product for my wallet. I do not have a real wallet but a small purse in a canvas bag with certain essentials. so a wallet that can fit my d/l, insurance card, 1-2 credit cards and my nursing ID was perfect. I do not carry cash usually, but it can fit 1-2 bills folded twice over.",5
856289,DO NOT BUY!!!! I wish I could give negative stars! Sizing chart is completely wrong on product! It states that Large is 36-38 and XL is 40-42 inch waist size. Later in the description it says XL is 32-39. Both are completely wrong! I'm a size 36 but got the XL cause I wanted something baggie... these are easily size X-Small or possibly female sizes.,1

592782,"BE AWARE: THE LARGE IS INADEQUATE FOR THOSE WHO WEAR ABOVE A SIZE 8.
I'm a size ten that normally takes a large. However, with a D Cup chest the top is way too small. The bottom also shows way too much skin for comfort. On top of that, when I opened up the package and tightened the straps, one of them popped right off completely. Very flimsy material. Was very disappointed. The best place to put this bikini was the garbage. Would not recommend.",1
158261,"It is very flimsy and soft.  doesn't look like a cowboy hat at all, actually it looks like a fedora!! Not like any Stetson ""Cowboy Hat"" I have owned.  The picture is very deceiving and the description is vague.  Don't recommend this hat, it is not shapeable either.  Not worth the money.",2
196215,"I really haven't had a chance to wear this jacket yet but when I tried it on it fit well, nice and roomy and light weight yet seemed warm.  I got it in dusty raisin which was a little dull in color but it is ok.  Over all I think it's going to be a nice jacket.",5
775869,"I ordered this dress in good faith that I would be satisfied with the product. The dress is entirely too big and too long, even in four inch heels. I was expecting to be able to return the dress for a full refund since the dress was for an event that happens only once a year. Instead you want me to return the product for something else, when all I needed was a purple gown for October 1, 2016. I am very disappointed.",1
595504,"I love it! First of all, I was concerned about whether the hat would be black or grey. After reading the questions about it, I decided to take the risk. Turns out it is nice and black to match my jackets. I love the fabric. It's very comfortable, has a nice shape, and is well made. It wasn't easy to find this exact hat. Now my dream of playing Eponine on Broadway is one step closer to coming true!!!",5
227597,"I bought these necklaces mostly as oil diffusers, so I wasn't concerned about what was inside, but as another reviewer noted 'it is an ugly clump of stuff inside' or something similar.  What is in there, even though it does glow nicely when charged, is a really ugly clump of stuff.  They could of at least glumped it in there neatly. A pretty piece of felt makes it look nicer, and the design on the lid is very pretty.  I will buy more of them.",4
533697,"It really is SUCH a beautiful ring! I have worn it every day for a week now. No green fingers, and no missing stones. For $12, hot dang! I am a happy camper!
Full disclosure: I also got mine as a deterrent for ""pesky"" men. But I have found that I love it's much anyway, I will wear it on my middle finger until it falls apart!",5
294225,I ordered a 2XL sizing up from my usual XL and they were way too small and just from pulling them out of the packaging you could tell that they were not a solid color at all they are more like tights than leggings. Very disappointed currently asking from a return.,1
6870,"This cut is for below the wais by design by Carhartt - and as such they fit as expected. Nice loose fit on the legs.

Do remember to check Carhartt's guides as the ""Regular"", ""Relaxed"", ""Loose"" aren't just the diameter - they affect where the belt sits. Above, at, or below the natural waist.

With a few more chest pounds than I'd like I need the belt just below the natural waist . This ""Loose Fit"" is designed to sit right there.",5
74778,I love this skirt.  I wish I had found it before I bought a similar one for my daughter for 3x as much.  The tulle is soft and not itchy.  The skirt portion is a bit shorter than I had hoped but it still worked perfectly with little shorts under it.,5
794794,This low cut V neck long sleeve top is comfortable and very stretchable. I ordered the medium and it fit me well. I just didn't expect that the neckline would be that low. It just showed too much cleavage for me that's why I  didn't take a picture of me while wearing it. I would still say this will make a nice casual top. The material used is just right and pretty warm. I received this top at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review. These statements are solely my opinion based on my experience.,4
320326,Love love love. This is chiffon material so there is no stretch to it. So if you have bigger arms order a size up. I'm normally a small and ordered a medium because my arms are bigger and it's perfect for me. I have big boobs which normally chiffon fabric doesn't work at all but since it's low cut it works great. Definitely recommend,5
505104,"Very soft and comfortable material and I like the length, it's not super short like some, I'm 5'10 and it sits below my waist. I'm 140 lbs and normally wear a size small or size 4-6 in almost all brands, I bought a small in this and it fits well, not too tight or loose. The only thing I didn't like was that the arm holes are big and sit low so it shows your bra and the unpleasant armpit fat!",4
322489,"This is a beautiful dress...But I normally wear a size large, and ordered a 3X because of the reviews..And it is still too small on top. And I am not big chested at all. Bad bad sizing! Do not order, as it will not fit, no matter what size you buy!!",1
422910,"looks as it does in picture, came fast, the lighter really works , its a cheap zippo , but for the price you cant even buy a good one for that, the rest is made very good tho. you can but a diff zippo in it, if you don't like the cheap one that it comes with. loved it would order from them again",5
101354,"These are one size fits most, but are a little on the small side. They fit perfectly for me, but I usually wear a 26/27 pant and am 5'4"" 125. I love the way they look and have gotten lots of compliments. If you are any larger than an 8 though, it may be a little tight on the top waist band.",5
10015,"Although these shoes are comfortable and easy to put on and take off, they destroy the integrity of almost any outfit I put on.  Anyone with fashion sense will advise against wearing these out.  They are more like house slippers.  You're more likely to get laid wearing Crocs.",2
4406,"The pricing is right for the quality. The fringe falls out & stretches. The size chart may not be accurate, little too small for me, but I made it work. I would not order it again, but it did serve its purpose & I threw it away after my event.",3
793813,"I wore this bra under a regular strapless bra, under a bridesmaid dress last weekend. It definitely provided the extra cleavage I was aiming for. After a few minutes, you don't even notice that you have something sticking to your skin. It stayed in place all night. I would highly recommend this product!!!",5
180893,"I can always fit just about any size large clothing. This jacket was more than just a little snug I couldn't even get halfway up my arm. I am in the middle of a PCs move from overseas so I decided to gift a friend of mine who is
a size 6. The jacket was very snug on
her and barely fit to the point where
she could not zip it. The sizing is completely off!!!! I am so dissappointed.",1
460617,"It's nice, it's not as warm as it is in the description. The cut at the back isn't perfect, it didn't fit great at some areas. It's definitely not a winter jacket if you're living in areas like 30F-40F. However, it's stylish, I like the length of the jacket and sleeves.",4
135803,"I got these for the friends who hosted my baby shower and they loved them. I knew I wanted to get them something that felt more personal, but I didn't want to break the bank. These were really affordable considering I had to buy 8! I really liked that. They feel pretty substantial in your hand. I definitely don't think they seemed cheap or ""foreign"". I was really happy that I chose to buy these!",5
534165,"The colors and print are lovely (I got the ""sky"" version)!  For the price, this is exactly what I expected. Unless you have an allergy, I'm not sure why you'd care what this was made of. It's soft and drapes nicely - plus, it's thin so it will be easy to wear even in warmer weather.  With prices like this, you can buy a TON of scarves!",5
403092,"This wool blend cap is perfect for warm and cool weather.  The material is soft but durable.  It is also a perfect color for combining with a number of different clothing styles.  I must say, I am highly impressed with this considering I usually look for known brands that cost twice as much.  I will be purchasing more of these in the future.",5
156358,"Product IS NOT RFID proof. I placed my I.D. inside the wallet and a scanner at work was still able to read it. Also the wallet no longer stays shut after I try to close it. I only had it for about 2-3 weeks. Normal use, pocket kept. This is a terrible product.",1
262213,"Where were these when I was a child!! I had stopped wearing posts over 20 years ago because of the constant loss of the backs of earrings. I mostly wear hoops but still wanted a pair of diamond studs. Paid extra for the screw backs and what happens...lost earring. Didn't even feel it come  out. With these locks, I don't have to worry. They stay put period. Tried with heavy posts and even when I pulled a heavy shirt over my head the earring moved but the post wouldn't let it go anywhere. Loves!",5
625763,The basic hat is ok but the floral applique is applied with so much glue it is tacky. The glue actually stands up above the flowers and it's all you notice. Will wear it around the house doing yard work but would not be seen in public in the gaudy thing!! What a disappointment this purchase was! Buyer beware of poor workmanship!,1
425589,"I ordered size 8 initially but it was too big. Size 6 fits well. I like the dress very much it fits well, on the picture the light parts look white but they are more like cream or gold. The delivery time was great however the package looked bad. It looked like the dress has been taken out of the plastic bag way too many times-I read there was only one left so I am guessing some one returned it. It was unpleasant to open the dress and see that the plastic was ripped.",4
626485,I ordered it xlarge to size up as was told so it fit very well  I was post baby when I tried it on I am saving this for my wedding vow renewal in three years lol but loved it when i saw it so I didn't wait to purchase.  I may have to have it resized by the time I wear it but that's because I plan to lose the rest of the baby weight and then some perhaps.  Beautiful dress,5
108755,"These are no better than the cheap plastic/metal round backs that I get with my jewelry. I have several Kendra Scott studs and I was hoping these would hold them better and I see no difference. I would like to return these, to be honest. Too much money for what they're worth. I don't get why so many are impressed with their results.",2
201150,"The quality was amazing and showed up early, but i ordered in in a size ""L"" for Large, but it came in something close to like a size small, i am deeply saddened by this and that i won't be able to wear my cute new outfits. but other than its size its spot on.",5

Only had them a week.
I they hold up for 6 months. I will give them 5 stars.",4
63664,"This outfit fits perfect!! And yes it does run a bit bigger than the true size. My size is usually 4-6 so you would think that you would choose a size small but you would actually need a size xsmall. All in all this fits perfect and I can't wait to wear it on Halloween!!  Whats even better is that it came earlier than expected , before Halloween! Thank you!",5
752919,"This hoodie is not at all like a tunic. I am 5'3 and 120lbs and I ordered a small. I couldn't even get it down over my chest and I'm not blessed in that area. It is super short too. Just holding it up to my body, the bottom just reached my hips. Tunics are supposed to be longer than that. Was really disappointed.",1
176565,"The suit arrived a day before my projected delivery window. The size difference between here and where it's made caused me to purchase a bigger size than I normally do. The top of the suit fits me perfectly but the bottom is a bit big. But with the shirt, you can't tell at all. Really like this suit and can't wait to wear it on the beach.",4
320446,I like the versatility that this item gives you. Great organization and you are not left digging in your purse or bag for your keys or phone. Just use the handles to pull out of your purse for a quick change. Great for someone that changes their purse to match their outfit. Numerous pockets for all of your items. With a large center pocket that will fit your Kindle or iPad. I would not recommend this item to be used alone. But a great organizer to fit into a larger bag.,4
701067,"These are very pretty if you only want it for jewelry. Makes a nice bracelet or necklace. However, I bought these hoping to use them for meditation and the beads are way too small for it to be comfortable while counting. Also, I chose the anchor but mine didn't come with one, solely beads.",3
864028,"The tassled edges loop together in knots when you walk.  It's possible that a less curvy woman wouldn't have this issue.  The fringe goes all around each leg.  The center became so entangled that I had to take a pair of scissors to cut them off.  Overall, it's a great look, but not quite as functional as I'd like.",3
556382,I purchased this to match my wedding set which has sapphires in it and my husband and I both love it. The sizing was right on and its comfortable to wear. The blue and white inlay looks great. I will say though it does reflect and catch a lot of light so some men may think it is too flashy. Overall a great but for us and we're very happy with it.,5

736724,"Worst pair of shorts I have ever had. The first time I wore them two buttons broke. One being the one above the zipper that helps to keep my pants up. Fixed that and wore it again, only to have another button break off and my keys went through a whole in the pocket. When I bent over to pick them up the back side ripped about 10 inches. Now they are in the trash.",1
250435,"We got this thinking the telescoping feature and metal would be a step up from an ordinary long plastic shoehorn. But it just didn't work for my dad (who recently got out of surgery). The metal spring is too flexible, so it doesn't work well to hold the back of the shoe in place when putting your foot inside. We ended up trashing it and going with a $2 long plastic one instead.",1

90444,"Im shocked.at how ugly this dress is.
The concept is cute.
The out come is not.
The dress is really poorly sewn together. My dog couldve done a better job. Te worst part is that the little waist ribbon doesn't do a thing. It always folds over and the sewn part becomes visible. It looks like someone was having non stop muscle spasms when they were sewing the two parts together.",1
718259,"thanks Dressystar for such amazing customer service and your prompt delivery. I received my shipment 4 wks before the e.d.d. couldn't be any more pleased with the material and over all look of the dress. it fit perfectly since Dressystar  allowed me to send my own measurements for a custom fit.
I must admit that the length was longer than necessary but that would be the only glitch if you could even call it that.
thanks again!!!",5

These are light weight, hug my feet comfortably and have a thinner upper so I can still feel the bag when I kick AND they have good lateral stability.

(I just ordered a pair to replace these inserts)  I did not listen to the comments from everyone as the arches are very high and there's not much cushioning with these inserts as they are very firm.  If you like cushioning & have flat feet, don't buy these inserts!",2
231620,"As others said, it was nice the first time you wear it, but after the leggins just ride up and feels like never ending wedgies.  Think a tighter fit/smaller size would have fixed this along with a longer leg length.  But as it stands I never used this and just wear a different brand that has longer legs and stays in place.",1
820876,"The dress is well made except that I am tall and the bodice was very short. I understand that it is supposed to fit high on the waiste, but if you are taller and larger in the bosom the dress starts to flare out more like an umpire waist fit than at your actual waist.  So it ends up looking very awkward and I am trying to find a belt to try to make it work, otherwise I will have to return it.",2
1424,"The chain I ordered was sent promply. It was great! The chain is on me 24/7 since it holds an Italian luck horn I wear. The chain looks great, and it has a good clasp. Perfect for holding my charm since I did not want to invest in white gold.",5
428843,Great Seller.  Nice looking earrings.  Love the way they close.  I think this design is one of the best type of closures in a hoop earring.  Easy to get on and off.  Comfortable enough to sleep in.  No allergic reaction.  This is the perfect size hoop for my piercing that is on top side of my ear.  Will buy again :),5
67918,"I bought this because I have a Samsung 10"" tablet and needed something sturdy to carry it in...where it would not be flopping around...and this bag is perfect.  I have used it...and I mean it is my every day purse and it is still hanging in there.  The leather is a good quality.  It's starting to fade a bit on the edges...but like I said that I use it everyday!",5

196988,Bought this robe based on reviews and price.  I was not disappointed.  For the price point it is beautifully crafted and the colors are amazing.  It is a bit large (I am a size 10) but actually like how it creates a flow to the robe.  I will be buying another for myself as well as some for gifts!,5
91942,I paid 26 bucks for glorified  spandex!  Are you kidding me? This is a ripoff not worth the money yeah they fit great and they look good and no they don't have that opening in the front as was asked is the add above the comments . Not buying anymore spandex billed as great underwear.,1
651287,"This shirt is not soft/comfortable, even after being washed a couple times. The button holes are too small, making it extremely difficult to button/unbutton. Size is too small compared to typical specified size.... seems to be a common issue among products from Asian nations. I ordered XXL (a US product would be an L for me), and it is still too small. But it fit the 10th-grade boy up the street, and he enjoyed the gift, though he commented on the small button holes, and on the ""scratchiness"" of the material.",3
563434,"This was on my son's wish list and he was SO excited when it bought it for him. He had surgery and I thought it would be a great surprise to cheer him up. It is a great looking shirt but SHRANK up at least two sizes when I washed it. Way to small for him now. What a complete disappointment!!! His cheep t-shirts don't shrink like this. This was a one time purchase for us, we don't usually buy expensive t-shirts.",3
90437,"Well it's not terrible, but it's not what I expected. The material is very VERY shiny and that was a deal breaker to me. When I saw that the bow was not actually connected I was a bit weird-ed out but the dress looked like a plastic blue and black garbage bag on me. It just wasn't particularly to my liking. It came early though:) That was a bonus",2

They look just as good if not better than any designer frames you'd get at an eyeglass store; and at a fraction of the price! But best of all, they have a very sturdy feel to them. Not flimsy or easily broken. I'll have to wait and see how they stand up to old father time, but they make an outstanding first impression right out of the box.
They may be cheap, but they don't feel or look like it. Great Buy :)",5

I wore them for halloween this year and got lots of compliments. I am an adult woman about 5'6"" and I was able to stretch out my arms fully while wearing them. My only complaint it that the elastic bands are a little tight around the arms. But if this is a really big concern you can always sew on some extra elastic to make some more room!",5

Initially, I bought a size 3 little kids, but they were way too large.  So, I returned them and ordered a size smaller, and they fit perfectly.  They are very comfortable... and cheaper than the ones at Nordstrom.  So, a win, win!",5

Very, very satisfied.",5

The item runs small and though I thought the 4XL would have been large enough - for most things she is a 1XL (14/16) - it was necessary to return the item for a 5XL. It is possible alone a 4XL would have worked, but definitely not with a blouse underneath. Otherwise, the quality is great and this is a very good value.",4
458804,"I checked the model number and it came back as an unregistered number. Considering the price, the quality it is promising, it smells like a fake.

124404,"I don't usually post reviews but this deserves one.  The costume is made of decent fabrics and is actually very well made.  It's got a bit of stretch to it so depending on your measurements (if in between sizes) you may be able to size down. I selected the size based off my largest measurement (I have an ""hourglass"" figure and went off the bust measurement) and then just took in the areas that were too big.",5

100962,"my husband has worn this brand in the past and was purchased through Sierra Trading Post. We thought we could find the similar ones here on Amazon, since STP didn't have the same ones he wore. These are an inferior product, with the fabric. You can definitely tell the difference and these won't last nearly as long as the original ones. they are nice looking, though.",4
623465,Good quality. Similar to what you might get at a store like Forecer21 - fabric is loose cotton as expected. Medium fits well. Buy based on how big you want the top to be because the waist has elastic and stretches. I was nervous to order this but it worked out well. I would order again and I'm going to look at other styles to possibly purchase.,4

Another pair that I used for cross fit/outdoor runs that lasted a little over a year (very vigorous daily use). All in all, these shoes are great for me. They're lightweight, and comfortable.",5

The TimeChant only takes a few hours regardless of sunlight.  It comes with a USB cable for power from any USB power source.  I highly recommend the TimeChant for solar watches.",5

163166,I'm not sure why some reviewers have had trouble with sizing. They were perfect for my daughter. She doesn't have skinny calves either. She's a soccer & volleyball player so her calves are fairly thick. I also borrowed them and my calves aren't nearly as thick as my daughter's. I found them to be very comfortable. They wash well. We didn't put them in the dryer. I allowed them to air dry to avoid possible shrinking. She has had them for 3 months and they are still just like new.,5

To clarify I have used the purse as an everyday bag. I theb returned the bag and purchased another as I still really liked the bag. Basically the same problems within a few days. I replaced the hardware and the bag is great. I just wish it would have been made with quality metal clasps and zippers.,2

This worked just as well, the cords held the seat completely in place and I even strapped my sons little carry on to it with no program.

I like the wide sun brim, I just wish there was a way to pin up the front brim when the sun wasn't in my daughter's face, but I'm sure I can add a piece of Velcro or something",4
723263,"It is a beautiful skirt  Love it I have not worn it yet saving it for my next cruise.  I am sure to get a lot of compliments.  It looks as pictured I thought the length was just right it does not go down to the ankles but this skirt does not need to due to the lace at the bottom  It is more visible to the eye hitting about mid leg. I am 5'6""",5
65871,"When I ordered these tongue rings at first I was quite skeptical because of how great the deal was, but i went ahead and ordered then anyways and was very pleased with my decision! They came right on time and even came with its own pouch. I had a few duplicates but I don't mind because how great of a deal it was! Ive also had them for a few weeks now and not a single one has broke. I definitely recommend!",4
478569,"I've been buying Hanes for at least 20 years, and love the Hi-Cut panties. I purchased both the 6-pack assorted and the 3 pack white and while the tidy-whities in the 3-pack were fine, the assorted were, well, assorted when it came to quality and fit. As others have noted, they were a thinner fabric than usual and the sizes were different when matched together. Interestingly, the Hipsters were fine and so, even though I don't like them as well, I may start wearing them instead, just for quality control.",3
532378,"This hat says baby boy, yet it fits my head (a grown adult),  I decided to keep the hat for myself cause I like the look on me.  In terms of a baby hat, you could put twins in the hat and there'd still be room left over.",3
101066,"So this is what it's like to wear really high quality underware? I'm hooked!!! Bye Bye Hanes. Hello comfort! These are so soft, supportive, and light that I have no complaints. They retain their support all day long too. Not like other types of boxer briefs that give up after a few hours. Thank you! These are awesome!",5
714357,"I'm very disappointed in the quality of this item. The only good thing to say is that each plug feels like its made out of stone and is the correct size. Now the bad. One of the white stone plugs I received had a chip/hole along the side that will cause it to become prone to collecting bacteria. Both of the brown stone plugs do not have the groove for the holding the o-ring in place, and the green plugs are much darker than what is shown in the pictures.",2
336034,"I don't understand why anyone gave this so many stars. It's a dress shirt made out of wind breaker material. Like literally. When you move around, it makes noise. It's ridiculous. And I had to order a size larger than usual based on others reviews (not that I'll ever wear it).",1
141121,"My bag arrived today, was excited to receive. There was no foul smell as others have mentioned in other reviews. The color was as pictured, the bag itself was as pictured but I thought it would be a little larger. I wish the handles were a little longer but overall its a great buy for a great price. I will update when I use it.... Its the inside that smells bad",5

556215,"Really beautiful blouse. Very good quality also. Just remember this is Chinese sizing. I am 5'5, 188 pound and I ordered an xx-large and it fits perfectly. So definitely go up two sizes. However the blue looks much lighter than the picture which isn't a big deal, it still looks beautiful.",5
347080,The dress is sexy as you no what ! But it has very minimum stretch i'm a size 14 and i got the extra large it was a little snug so it gave me the initiative to lose a few pounds I will be wearing this June 2nd 2017 on my 50th birthday I will be posting pictures. Fyi if you are a big busty girl this definitely will not work. I'm a 38b and i purchased the deep plunge bra because I don't like my little girls running free lol !,5
161724,I love this item. Though bodysuit is a better name for it it fits great and is super cute. I want one in just about all colors. I will definitely be purchasing from this seller again. The shipping came in expected time and it was seriously worth the wait and inexpensive.,5
140321,"These little earrings are just adorable! Cute for a little girl and for big girls too.  ;)
Very decent quality for the price- enameled metal. Great for any girl who loves cats and tiny things in general. I'm getting another pair so I can wear 2 cats or fishies at once.  <3",5
462511,"I love these shoes and got so many compliments on them! I am normally an 8-8.5 size, so I ordered an 8.5 to be safe. They are a tad snug, so I walked around the house in them with socks on to help stretch them out. I got so many compliments on them and was able to wear them all day without suffering :) This is a great buy, I'll likely get another pair in the blue.",5
417539,"We bought this watch as a present for my daughter, a Marine Corp pilot who was being winged. It is a fine watch, worthy of the price and worthy of it's reputation.  Our mistake was that it is a little to fancy for my daughter to wear in the cockpit of a marine copr aircraft. She though she might be embarrassed because it was so glitzy. Our mistake though, not the watch. It is a very fine product well worth what we paid.",5
145567,"I just opened the package and even though is small (my fiance has small fingers) it looks real clean and well finished. The Swarovski stone looks like a real diamond.

Many people have said that this ring won't turn black so in the next couple of months i'll be updating on that.",2
556040,Its falling apart and has been used for less than 2 weeks.  Was very excited to get it due to having the check register on the opposite side as most of them do.  Thought it was wonderful until you start putting it in your pocket and it starts to tear at the seams.  I know alligator should be a lot tougher than that..  Wow a month later and the whole thing is falling apart.  Horrid,2
178272,"Definitely take your measurements and if in doubt err on the side of larger but mine fits perfectly and is adorable. The only thing I might change (and will likely sew on myself) is that strap s on the top are thin and tend to cut into my breasts. I'd will be adding a wider sash type tie. Still, for the price it is better than I had expected.",5
139662,"I am 5ft 11 inches tall and a size 12-14. I usually wear size L in women's and size XL in juniors. I bought the size 5x of this hoodie based on the reviews and it fits wonderfully. I  have broad shoulders and a wide rib cage w/ 34D bra size. This sweatshirt fit around me without issue and has a little extra room when zipped up. The white lining is a very thin soft material, but still pretty. Overall, I would say the quality is on par with Forever 21 or H&M.",4
663527,"When these leggings arrived, I held them up and thought, ""Aw heck no those aren't going to fit!"" because they looked so small, but I put them on and they fit really nicely. They hug perfectly. I'm a little curvy in the thighs and butt and they don't feel overly tight. Love the top for keeping the tummy looking hot. The legs creep up a little bit and I think they'll probably be see-through in a few washings, but they are super cozy and I like them.",4
576216,"I opened the bag and held the shirt up to make sure that it was what I ordered. Next thing you know, my dog was chewing on something. I took it away from her and I realized it was one of the buttons that are up at the top of the shirt. I TOUCHED (key word ""touch""... not pull, tug, nothing) the other button and it literally fell right off! Super annoyed!",1

721908,"Not too pleased with this Wool Knitted Short Sleeve Cardigan, it just seemed to fit differently than what is showed on the model. To me it is much shorter, & the sleeves are a bit uncomfortable, kind of like tiny holes to fight your arm through. Maybe these just run smaller than what is stated. Now, the quality is very nice, it is made very well. If you are a smaller frame, I highly would recommend this cardigan to you. Overall, it is just not for me sadly. I received this product at a discount for my honest, unbiased review.",3
500950,"was pleased to see that Dragon palace actually delivered this bracelet to me - I ordered it with much trepidation as the last time I ordered from them, they substituted a different bracelet without informing me.  But this one came quickly (less than a week) and is beautiful - mixed tones of gray, sky blue and silver - wonderful with my other bracelets, and looks great with jeans too.  I like the wrap bracelets best and this one is lovely.",5
135973,"I ordered it about a week ago(Decemeber 7th), and it said estimated shipping and arrival to the U.S would take up to January 20th!!
But this was by far the fastest shipping i got for a really good price!
The sweater is smaller than it looks, but not to small! I thought it would be a bit more oversized (like i hoped) but either way it is very cute and warm!
Will buy from this seller again!
Thanks to the sellers and buy with you guys soon! :)",4
712748,"This is not what I expected.  The fabric looks very loose and flowing, maybe even like a sweatshirt, but it is more of a sweater fabric, and it truly feels like wool feels when you have put it through the washing machine by mistake. This one is going back.",2
303929,"Good quality material however, the fit is not comfortable. Ordered a med for a 34B (5'4 140lbs) cup size and its small! I'd recommend upsizing. It's a struggle with the initial zip up. Would buy again if I ordered a larger size and it be a comfortable wear. Right now, no.",2
578509,"I'm 5 ft 4, 147 lbs, size 10/12 and my measurements are about 39-30-42. I ordered a large originally but returned it for a medium. I'm short so the large was a little too long on me. I've ordered 2 of these leggings so far and will probably order more!",4
520197,"I love these pajamas!  I read the reviews and ordered a larger size than I normally wear, and they are a perfect fit. I have eczema and need all cotton, which these are. They're really comfortable. I feel comfortable wearing them around the house without covering up with a robe, which is nice.

I would prefer a pattern other than horizontal stripes, but the look is growing on me. Even with that, they're so comfortable I don't care.

I love the way the legs and sleeves don't ride up; no constantly adjusting them in bed. I highly recommend them.",5
608372,"After reading several comments about the fit, I sized up on this one. However, I find the item fits more or less as expected. So the size M needs to go back. Size S is a comfortable fit across the shoulder and chest, but a bit loose around arms and midriff. (As a point of reference, I'm 34-bust and 24-waist.) Material is soft and stretchy, but suitability for hot yoga remains to be seen.",4
474288,"This worked well! I got mine a little tight as I didn't read the sizing information. It also took awhile to receive. It unraved after the first time that I hand washed it. If you have a event to go to I would make the purchase as it does work, it's just not a very long lasting item.",3

351176,"This is one solid shoe horn.  And not that it's really that important, the color is awesome. It works really well and if you have a really tight situation it doesn't bend or feel like it's going to break at all.  I have one with a hollow handle and a plastic horn.  It is really scary to use because it gives and you are just waiting for it to snap.  Which is why I purchased this one.  It did not disappoint.",5
457791,"This product wasn't exactly what I expected it to be. I've ordered similar products from other sellers and the charms were metal. The charm on this product was however plastic which wasa little disapointing. The seller refunded me a percentage of the cost and I kept the product. Instead of keeping it myself, I gave it to my niece.",3
404443,"This is a very attractive purse. I get complimented on it frequently. However I have Only had it for five months now and the lining around the button is already tearing.  The button itself is a magnet that stays secure. But the lining is too weak to keep up with frequent use. The stitching around thCute but doesnt hold up.e outside leather is also coming apart.
I would expect more longevity  from a leather purse.",2
590039,"This is my second one. They run a tad large (like Woman Within styles). Totally love that it is full length so I can tuck my feet up under when sitting curled up with a book.  I particularly like this blue.  Oh! and the pockets, I love that there are two deep pockets.  It's well made, medium weight material, no problems.  I recommend this lounger.",5
72331,I purchased these for my grandson and he loves them. They really are cute on him and he says that they are very comfortable. I purchased a pair for his little brother directly from the Crocs website because Amazon was sold out of his size and the ones I bought from Amazin were $9 cheaper AND they arrived two days sooner than the ones from Crocs. Gotta love Amazon!,5
649282,"I realized I hate bikinis because of the strings, and ocean waves make me expose myself to the public, so I got these , and I love them. It's like a sports bra and spanks, so I wear them  to work out sometimes too. Also my boobs stay inside when I encounter ocean waves, which is nice. The top is thin, so if you don't want people to see your nipples, don't get them or sew some extra padding or fabric inside like I did.",5
45921,I really like this costume! However it did fit a bit snug on my legs.. I am 5'3 118lbs.. it doesn't have as much stretch as I thought it would being a spandex suit and reading all the other reviews.. But I still loved the costume and it wasn't overly tight to where it was uncomfortable to wear the whole night.,4
98661,"You did not.  I love the bag.  However the long strap which I wanted , end clasps are very cheaply made.  Have bent several times.  My husband rebent them closed only to have them open again.  At this time can not use the strap.  Very disappointed.",3

202631,"It arrived on time. It's a cute neck piece however, when I went to open it to wear, I noticed it was broken. It arrived broken. To be more clear, one of the links was not hooked. I couldn't wear it because the piece that was missing was a critical part of the necklace holding up (the middle portion). Without the piece being present, the necklace wasn't wearable. I'm very disappointed.",2

870654,"Do not bother buying this bathing suit! The sizes are completely off, much more so than other suits on Amazon. I ordered the 5XL and it's probably made for someone who is an 8/10. The top alone would hold a C cup at most and the bottoms were very disproportionate! And you can't return for free! To ship back to China would have cost me $125. Now I'll have to donate it to Goodwill. Thanks for nothing.",1

The stone size of 1 carat through me off, it was smaller than I expected and not as dark as I need to match some other jewelry items that she would combine them with when she wheres them. It was a great deal and the return policy is good. Looks like I will only be out the shipping back costs.",2
161989,I like this robe it is comfortable however it is very heavy literally.. It feels like an overcoat. It will be really good for winter but living in Florida gets to be a little too much for the summer. I ordered a short.

I like the fabric, it is free flowing, but somehow, not very comfortable to wear in the hot humid place, where I live in!! I like the length of the cardigan which makes it ideal to wear on dresses, but the arms were longer than 3/4 for me, I am 5'2'' and i have many cardigans which are 3/4 in length, but these arms are longer and I do not like that aspect of the cardigan.",4

And I love that it doesn't have any jewel on it so now my ring won't get stuck in my hair anymore and I won't have to take it off every time I shower!!
Best ring ever.",5
837805,"I ordered this suit to wear in Vegas for a company trip. I wanted something that was sexy yet modest. The quality of the suit is fantastic. Nice thick material. Does not feel cheap. My only compliant is the lack of support in the chest area. I know that there is only one shoulder strap, but that made me feel like one side was supported while the other side was just there. Other than that, the suit was very flattering. Fit as expected.",4
503348,"This is a nice top of nice quality and was a slightly longer length which is what I was looking for.  Would look beautiful on a teen or younger adult as it is a bit form fitting, but lucky for me, I ordered a size up considering my age and it fit very nice.

Literally looks just like the real Samantha Vega one and is super good quality- seams are finished, no loose threads, solid construction and high-quality fabrics and finishes.

673643,"I wore this for my wedding and it was beautiful! One or two of the rhinestones came off but you couldn't tell because it alternates between rhinestones and pearls. I really liked the width of this sash because I think it makes your waist look smaller. The rhinestones go about 60-70% of the way around your waist (depending on how big your waist is), so they cover all of the front side and a little bit of the back. The ribbon is long enough to tie a big bow in the back.",5

254054,Received my wallet as scheduled.  Real leather  with enough space for my Samsung Galaxy s5 using a small case.  My only wish is that the zipper was on three sides and not just the top.  Shiny enough to wear to a concert/dinner without it being too flamboyant.  Happy with my purchase.  Thankyou.,4
16631,The ones I received are clearly knock-offs as the sizing is inaccurate. They are a EUR41/2 ; BR39-40 and US Women's 7/8. This is wrong. The corresponding size in the US system would be a US Men's 7/8 (equivalent to a US Women's 9/10). I purchased several pairs of Havaianas while living in Brazil (always the 39-40) and they were not like these. I have to say they are pretty good quality knock-offs though - which explains why I paid only 9.99.,1

Worth the price! Stylish bag!",5

The shirt goes 2-3"" below my waist, which makes the length of a large extra large for me. Quality of the shirt is OK.",3
382682,"I gave this 2 stars because it is a really nice looking purse, but not for anything heavier than maybe a wallet. I used it for little over 1 week to go to work with my ultrabook laptop which is less than 4lbs, my wallet, and a planner. Already one of the straps were coming apart at the seams, see pictures. I was really disappointed since this purse was perfect, but alas the quality of the straps is not reinforced enough, which is just not acceptable since many women carry a lot of items in their purses!",2
831596,"I wish the top was bigger because it was a LITTLE bit smaller than I wanted it to be for my comfort. I actually had to take out the padding that was included because it is WAY too small. It honestly just looked weird, it was like a D cup bra with A cup padding. Instead, I had to wear a bra under for support but I didn't mind because the straps aren't noticeable with this style bathing suit. It's well made and hella cute, I received ton of compliments!",4
85133,"Overall good value. Fit is fully adjustable with a drawstring. Hat seems to provide good shade to my neck. I've taken a few walks around our neighborhood and it's worked well... Hasn't blown off yet either!  Looking closely, there were some seams where the sewing was uneven or seemed to have a few threads hanging loose, so I'm wondering how this will hold up, but I think the value was excellent for the price.",4
28938,So far the inserts are working very good.  My Dr. wanted approx $700. for custom inserts and a local concern specializing in foot related issues was looking for $350. for inserts.  I think the key is simply building the arch back up and Powerstep at $20. seems to be working.  The key is to always have an insert in place no bare foot activity or you negate the concept.,5
156720,"I really like the style and looks of this quality case. It makes a statement when I pull it from my front pocket.
It is small enough to feel comfortable in my pocket as well. There is no problem holding 6 credit cards even
with 2 of them being metal cards. Thanks munch for a great product; I even bought a 2nd as a gift and I just might order
another one for myself to ensure I will always have a spare.",5
833382,Less than one month of taking the bag to the gym 3 times a week and the inner lining tore away from the top inside leaving the largest side compartment open to the inside of the bag. Useless. Fortunately Amazon did not quibble about returning it for credit. Wow! Nice looking bag. Don't see why they would use fabric for the liner that couldn't hold the stitches.,1
626218,the bracelet is prety and my wife loved it until the stones began to fall out. they fell out upon her wearing it the first time. I guess I should expect to get what I pay for and this item being as inexpensive as it is I should expected it to be junk.,1
69998,"These are a really great deal.  The are very well matched for size and shape, and don't look like potato pearls.  They are very smooth, with very few ridges/bumps.  Much better than the sets you would get for $10-15.  Also much better than a set I bought for $85 at a local department store.

Well strung (hang properly, not too tightly strung).  Come in a nice gift box with cleaning cloth.",5
710371,This is very large but I love the way it flows. I plan on ordering it again in a smaller size. It looks great with my skinny jeans and platform sandals. This past winter I wore it with my skinny jeans and boots! I live in the deep south so we don't have a real winter. Very versatile and can be worn year round!,5
423798,"I was scared to buy these cuz u never no when buying online the true color or size or quality ,but I took a chance and I'm so happy I did !! the rose gold is spot on ,not to pink and great color rose gold they are ! Love them !if u like rose gold but a pair u can't beat the price for these babies !thx",5
808772,"i love these kaftans!!!  unfortunately, this one arrived with the drawstring stuck clear in the back of the garment - a pain to pull back through so it works, but I had my boyfriend do it so all is well.
for the price point, these kaftans are absolutely gorgeous, super comfortable and awesome. I get compliments whenever i wear one.
i will most definitely be purchasing more.
thank you!!!!!!!!",5
237327,"The hood is nowhere near as large as depicted (no one will see the actual seal face on the hood unless you're short), and the flippers don't have anything stitched on them as depicted. There's also a very obvious zipper seam along the back which isn't depicted in the photo. Basically, this item doesn't live up to the photo at all, and I would caution against buying this. Quality is very low.",2
655640,"I am obsessed with this swimsuit! It fits perfectly and is great quality! I recently purchased another suit like this from another seller and although they are nearly identical in style, material  and fit, this suit fits slightly better. I am in love and would totally recommend. I included a picture of me wearing it. And you can't beat the price on top of it all!",5
435971,"I've been giving these out to the other licensed marine engineering officers on my ship to sort of distinguish them from the regular unlicensed crew.  Everyone has really appreciated the gift.  Quality is great, the brushed pewter is nice and shiny and the post that you stick through your lapel is firmly attached.  I can't think of a single imperfection.  Highly recommended for that propulsion engineer in your life.",5
98039,"I have received other shirts from the company, this is the best quality (material) compared to the others. same issue though, the tag always says a different. I've always order a small, but get a medium or large. this was a large and it was a bit baggier than I wanted.",3
58839,"I now live in Naots, having given up most of my trendy shoes.  These shoes, as previous reviewers claimed, are wonderful.  Right out of the box, I wore them to a downtown meeting, walked all over in blistering heat on oft-cobblestoned sidewalks, and the sandals were easy to wear for hours.  They are cute, stylish, and fit true to Naot's standard of complete comfiness.  I hadn't seen this Cymbal style in any store, and when I bumped into them on line, I was excited. These shoes are a winner.",5
689639,"I've been searching for an organizer purse of this size for a very long time.  This one is perfect.  I was concerned that the ""wallet"" area would take up too much interior space, as all the other purses I've had have had an exterior wallet.  But it is actually more spacious inside than other purses that look the same size!  It holds a ton of stuff.  It is the perfect ""go with everything"" shade of beigey-grey.  So happy to have found my purse!",5
36648,"I'm satisfied with the umbrella itself, but was disappointed in the condition it arrived in. The whole thing inside and out was covered in a foggy film making it very cloudy. I was able to get it in good condition after spending about 25 min. cleaning each section at a time and then going back over it a second time but I really should not have had to do that.",3
484905,"Great wallet. I've been carrying mine in my front pocket for going on two years. I've carried between 3-7 cards in it with up to 10 bills. It's not meant to be a high capacity wallet to carry around a photo album of your wife and kids or every single receipt you've ever gotten. It's great for a minimalist trying to cut down on bulk. Mine's withstood the test of time well, developing a patina and holding together without fraying. I'd recommend this wallet to anyone looking for a front pocket wallet or a way to unclutter their pockets.",5
768880,"What a disappointment. The jacket is way too small and stinks of fish. The size chart was different than when I placed my order, XS bust size was 91cm at the time. Then during the transaction for 3 weeks, it seems that they've changed the size table.  XS is now 80cm. I've never ever bought clothes with a bust size less than 90cm, so I measured it, and it was only 28inch=71cm! It's UNACCEPTABLE at all!
What's more, the lapels are so stiff, they stick straight out( look at the 3rd pic). Not fashionable either!",1
650733,I bought these pajamas (matching) for my granddaughters this year and they loved them as much as they did last Christmas.  They are all cotton and fit nicely and was well.  The girls and their mothers love them.  I plan to keep buying these PJs as Christmas presents indefinitely!,5
111419,"They fit fine over my shoes. i wear a 7.5 or 8, and I got the large. These are also very flat and so easy to pack for any trip, which is why I bought them. I got stuck on a trip without waterproof shoes. Now I'm all set for rainy weather when I'm away.",5
774657,"Doesnt fit like the photo at all, but doesnt look too bad on. I have an average body type with a smaller rear end. The fit around the wrists is tight and I have small wrists. It has an elastic band around the bottom too, so it isn't loose like it looks in the photo and sits above my butt.  Ive actually read that the images with the head missing from the model are taken from other catalogs from more expensive companies and reproduced (sometimes really poorly) in China.",3
5215,I bought 4 different pairs of these pants in different colors. Carhartt pants tend to run a bit small in the waist so I would recommend getting one size up. I wear a 34 waist but got these in a 36 waist and they fit perfectly! The length is perfect. Great work pants!,5
444077,Love this dress! Wore it as a strapless number to a club and over one shoulder for a wedding. I am going to keep playing with the wrap features as it is so versatile. Feel beautiful in it. Hubby loves how it hugs without being too revealing. Just sexy enough. The picture looked a little more purple in my browser. The actual dress is more burgundy. Still a great dress and looks great on. Am looking to buy another color. Just love it!,5
847459,Size 120 - My daughter is 5 and pretty tiny compared to other kids her size. This fits pretty well with room for her to grow. She loves it. It is definitely see-through on all the black lines between fin designs on actual fin and bathing suit bottom so I would say that is only downfall to the products so far. Pretty happy with purchase. Will update after washing and she has worn it a few times.,4
757668,"Absolutely love this.  Great for sleep or lounging.  The fabric is fairly heavy, which is comforting in a way.  Make sure you check the size charts - Woman Within sizing is a bit different.  My only complaint is that the pockets are a bit high.  I wish they were closer to hip-level and not waist-level.",5
3934,"This is the first time I've bought a costume online that I DIDN'T regret! I wore it to 3 parties, got lots of compliments about it, and I will definitely wear it again in the future.

One of my concerns was that the material would be cheap and the fringe would be too sparse. Neither were the case! I'm 5'5, 150 lbs, generally wear a size 10 dress, and I bought a size Large. It fit perfectly, but any smaller around the hips (mine are 40"" around) would have been a problem.

Over all, I'm very satisfied!",5
381384,"I really like this product. However, I ordered a 0-3 month size and the size that I received looked to be around what a one year old would wear. It was a baby shower gift, and I did not have time to return it. The mommy to be still loved it and plans to save it until the baby grows into it, but it is still dissappointing not to be able to have him wear it for  a while.",3
467196,I bought this for me and hubby we never take them off. I have bathed with mine one and there is no discoloring. he was in a car accident with his on was thrown around car it didn't break and only left a bruise/rub burn. worth the money but wish they had come in a gift box instead of a baggy,5
117705,"Love this kilt! Husband needed a less formal kilt he didn't have to worry about ruining and this one is perfect. Heavy duty material, great fit, great style and color! He wears a 30-31 in jeans so we ordered a 34 and it fits perfectly since he wears his kilt on his hips rather than his waist! Couldn't be happier...now we just need one for my 14 year old!",5
770800,"I gave it one star because it was prime eligible but the item I received looks NOTHING like the picture. I ordered red which is displayed as a knee-length skirt with a belt matching the same fabric as the skirt. Instead, I received a short red plaid skirt with a very cheap fake leather belt. I am beyond upset. I ordered this for holiday pictures that I need to take with my child for a holiday card!!! This is ridiculous. Now I fear to even order another skirt to receive the same thing.",1
87522,"i got a medium and im 5""3 with a size C 32 bust and the dress fit me great. it didn't come with a belt but i had one i could use so its fine. the top is a bit see through but with a nude bra you cant tell.",4
720718,"Liked it but didn't love it. It was a bit heavier than I had hoped and a bit snugger, though I believe it was designed to be that way. It is very well made and a nice piece of geat, just wasn't exactly what I was looking for so I returned it.",4
461196,"great smooth finish, the paint job on the eyes was great, nice weight to the charm, the only reason i dint give it a 5 star is because of the necklace it comes with. the necklace is super light and cheap looking. but not a bad charm for the pice :)",4
36053,"I got these umbrellas for my 3 year old and 6 year old.  They do the job and I love that opening and closing the umbrellas is free from fear and tears from pinched fingers.  Yes, they are ""dirty"" when you first open them as they are covered in powder to pevent the plastic from sticking.  I simply wiped them down with a wipe and they were good to go.",5
306326,"I absolutely love these socks, I will definitely  be ordering more! I have been looking for some socks like these for quite some time now and I didn't even think to look on Amazon, I'm so happy I did! They are perfect for my very active 10 month old!",5
523894,"These socks are great, with the many pattern choices you can have fun socks along with the normal colors.  I have laundered them a few times and so far they still stay up with no sagging..Since I started wearing them I have not had any leg cramps during the night, therefore....socks with benefits. These are now the only socks I wear.",5
16321,These are my fav flip flops.  Love to wear them around the house and if I happen to run out with them on I don't feel like I'm walking barefooted.  The straps were a little loose on this particular pair but otherwise the quality is good and the straps don't feel flimsy.  I try to buy them on sale so it's a good deal when I find them.,4
257879,"My 10 year old loved the design of these rainboots. They run a little big - shes a 2, and we ordered a size 2 - but she needs thick socks so her feet aren't moving around to cause blisters. We don't mind shoes being a little big, so she kept them. The quality of the boot is good, solid. Excellent for the price. Would recommend this as a good purchase for a child.",5
13283,"I have some good New Balance running shoes that still looked good.  However, my feel always hurt when running.  I tried to salvage my shoes a little by buying some new insoles.  I must say, it's like I have brand new shoes!  In fact, it even feels better!  The arch support is amazing and my feet don't hurt when i'm done.  I only run about 2 or 3 miles, but with these, maybe I can run a few more.  Nahh.......",5
570305,They are so beautiful but are to small. I can understand how different companies can have different fix but i believe I got three pair of pants for the same compnay and all three fit different. Odd!! But when I do ge the righ tsize I know I will love them like i have the other pairs thanks,3
356680,The costume we got is decent for the money but is quite different from the picture. It's close but not quite as nice as the picture. The tags on each item are enormous and had to be cut off. The gauntlets in this package are foam and to be honest a bit cheesy.,3
465989,"I ordered four of these to make some special christmas presents for my sons teachers - my son loves airplanes!  These were excellent quality, looked even nicer in person.  They are not marked .925 and hollow underside.  But very good quality and i would definitely buy them again.  Very cute on silver chain or to add to a charm bracelet (although it has a closed ring, not a clip).

Overall very impressed with this product and the price was very reasonable.",5
752161,This is a clever shirt and a great gift for fans of the video game(s) Fall Out.  Not a terribly thin fabric for price it fit as usual and didn't shrink after drying on low heat.  I always wash such shirts inside out to maintain the illustration and would advise the same here.,4
277563,Ugh I love it but it's too big I wear a medium and read to gona size down so I did and the small I can go all the way to the last clips already I exchanged for a xsmall everyone's different so if your a medium I'd say get a small just to make sure,2
783911,"I loved the product. It seems like the authentic one to me, but I guess since it's not from the original lokai website, it's not a guarantee. They fit like the chart says they will and are absolutely fantastic. They are durable and I'm constantly getting asked about them. Just reordered as a gift for a friend. The four stars and not five is just because i'm not 100% about its authenticity.",4
552055,"I ordered this because it said fleece tunic.  Tunics are supposed to be long, and this fits more like a jacket.  It barely covers the back of my butt & I am a short-torso person.  I was hoping it would be 4-5 inches longer so I could wear it with leggings & boots but it doesn't look like a true tunic.  However - I kept it because it is very warm, and it's soft & comfy.  Just too short in my opinion.",3
451264,It's not very bright and polished and indeed it is very small. I have tiny eats and it scrunched it up and pulled the lobe up wards.  It is for a young child. I even tried to bend it nicely to see if I could  expand the size. .......hah.....a Crack immediately appeared right above the x. Very disappointed,1
128658,"The jacket is comfortable and fits well. It keeps you dry. It says it's lined, which it is, but it's very thin mesh material. If you're looking for a jacket to wear when it's warm and rains it works great. If you're looking for a jacket to wear when it's a little cold and rainy, you might want to find a jacket that's a little bit heavier.",4
566821,"Great bag! I had to repair the strap so I took a star off for that, but since then it has held up nicely. It had an unfortunate encounter with some sticky stuff one day and I was able to wash it and hang it to dry. It looked as good as new after that.",4
669550,"I wish this would have worked out. I wish the shirt actually looked like the one displayed that would have been even better. I purchased the blue bird print top because I thought it was adorable and a great price. The shirt looked off white which is what I wanted, The shirt came in a not off white but a pale neon yellow that reminded me of my puppy's accidental puddles... not really what was pictured. IF however the color was as shown I would have been a happy consumer.",2
220866,A business associate showed me a pair of ThinIptics just today. I was amazed at how light they were and how well they stayed on my nose. Best of all I am able to read all the fine print on my iPhone. I'm here to buy a pair for myself right after I write this review.,5
695472,"I love this beanie hat! My head is on the large side and I won't wear anything too tight. It's loose enough to fit over bunched up hair and hair clips, however my hair is very thin and fine so it doesn't take up much room. I have 4 colors now. Just found one in pink! Woo hoo! Jack pot!",5
56103,"Good quality, beautiful outfit.  The 0-3m size fit my 6 week, 11 pound, 22 inch baby boy great around the body, but would be too short if he were much taller.  I didn't wash it beforehand so don't know if it shrinks. Highly recommend, especially for short chubby babies. Wear a white onesie underneath.",5
158514,"We liked that they had the plastic clips but on the second day of my husband wearing them, one of the clips apparently lost its little metal piece that holds them together. Needless to say we were very disappointed that they didn't last as long as the metal ones we were use to purchasing and for a whole lot less than what we paid for these.",2
492084,"I couldn't be happier with this item.  I was a little worried at first since I have never carried a bag this large, but it's even better than I imagined.  I am glad this bag allows me to show off my love for the outdoors, but with a classy touch.",5
169235,"My girlfriend bought me these a few months ago and they are without a doubt the most comfortable boxer briefs I have ever owned. I want to eventually replace all my boxers with these! Unfortunately (and this may be only my specific item), they did not last longer than 6 months, and tore where one of the stitches was not done correctly. This is the only reason they are not receiving a fifth star from me, otherwise a phenomenal product!",4
834550,"I am 59,  ordered this dress in maroon size medium. The fit is very good in the beginning, however shrinks terribly after one washing, making the lining visible, and it is a different color than the rest of the dress.  You can stretch it out, sort of, but it doesnt look the same.  Very disappointing",2
679986,"I ordered an X-Large because I have ridiculously large hips, and It fits great! It doesn't fit the bust to well, but I expected that since I ordered on size due to my hips not my bust. However, it isn't unbearable to deal with and doesn't look like it. It was a great buy for the price.",4
497837,"I ordered three sizes larger than I wear because I love this shirt, but still too small.  I gave it to my daughter and she can wear it and loves it, but why can't us bigger gals find clothes that are cute anywhere?  It's not much fun to order 3 whole sizes larger and find out how fat you really are.",3
606524,"The color is accurate to the photo. But the quality is significantly less. The tulle part of the skirt is more tea length than floor length and the lining underneath was knee length, which is a very different look from the photo. The fabric is cheap and so is the construction. I could have made it myself for less. There is also a lot less volume than expected as well. Overall disappointing.",1
443039,"This was more like a tank-top than an oversized crop top.  My daughters an 8/10 in street clothes and this in no way fit her.  We'll use as a tank instead of returning bc the cost was great, but I definitely advice going up not 1 but 2 sizes!!",3
196358,"Bought this for my senior spring break coming up in april. Was expecting my bathing suit about middle of march. (A month shipping) it is 2 weeks from my ordering date, and i got it today! So impressed with it! Sizing was perfect! Color is beautiful, shipping was super fast!  Love love love this!",5
139792,"We were able to get our son in this cute little outfit right when we got home from the hospital.  We tried to take a few more pictures a week later and it was too tight.  The hat was really small from day one.  We laid it on his head, as opposed to pushing his head in it.  My son was 7.5 lbs when we brought him home and about 8lbs when we tried to fit him in the outfit again.",4
537638,"I was so extremely pleased about how well this dress fits!!! I bought a small and it fits wonderfully! Not too short or too long, not too tight. Perfect in the bust (I'm a 34C) and it's very flowy! Such a perfect summer dress! I've gotten so many compliments on it! And the pricing is wonderful, too! Very good quality! 10/10 would recommend and buy again! I'm so happy!! 5'2""/ 130lbs",5
567420,"The piece is lovely but from the description it wasn't obvious that the name Sydney was engraved on the skirt. I thought Sydney was just the name of the piece or style. My daughter was disappointed, felt it was weird to have a random name hanging in her car. Had to purchase a different design as a replacement.",3
376999,"These are two belts and two extra buckles that could last you 10 years.  AND they appear to have no metal in them, so we may not need to take your belt off for airport security.  Great design, great price----a travel belt for those who are frequent flyers.",5
857414,"I didn't notice the (2pc,3T) until I received the item and wondered why I only received two cheap shirts! It should picture only 2 shirts when you select that size to avoid confusion for future buyers. Definitely not worth the price for two. You receive the lion and the green dinosaur, not the cool monster one. The lion shirt is made well, other one not so much. Basically you're paying $20 for one shirt.",3
826976,"The material is polyester, which I hadn't realized when I ordered.  I would have lived with my mistake if not for the fact that this particular material has a very unpleasant, almost sticky feel to it.  In addition, the sleeves are made for pencil-thin arms, which few people have.",2
472177,"Great strap for any watch. Purchased this and it was of better quality than another favourite ' S' brand in amazon. colour and made was as shown and it feels just nice. There are so many colours and type to choose other than the ones you would like to buy. I bought plenty of other straps from clockwork before,and i am very satisfied so far. Will update about the condition of the loop rings if available,because i was disappointed with the other brand's durability of the loop rings, They tend to rust,so hopefully this will not...",5
166773,This was the second pair of these I had ordered i ordered one in charcoal in XL and they fit perfectly but the navy is to tight in the waist and is not an XL more like size LG. I'm so sad that the navy didn't fit properly as I would have purchased  more in different  colors but these pants are not consistent in there sizing don't want to chance it.,2
752472,"I purchased a size 8 for my niece's 9th birthday, the length is perfect but it is huge in the waist and butt.  It is cut weird and she can not wear it.  Overall we are disappointed and I would not recommend it to anyone else.  It is unfortunate because that was the item she wanted the most for her birthday and she lives in another state.",1
703411,It's a nice jacket but the arms were too long. We ordered it for a December wedding but its not going to fit her so we had to order a different jacket for the wedding. We kept this one for her to grow into though because it was so nice.,4
96986,"Based on the reviews I bought this shirt in a size M. I am 5ft 3 and weigh between 115-120 lbs and have a 36in chest (haha depending on the day...you know how it is) The shirt fits me like it does in the picture. It is very cute, is nicely made. I am very pleased with this purchase. I wish I would have went with a small and may buy one in small since they are so cheap that way I have one if I want to go with a more fitted look.",5
54504,Received the frames a day early so that's a plus. The frames were somewhat dirty when I took them out of the case. The material seems rather durable and they fit comfortably. I am slightly hesitant if these really are authentic. It does not state on the frames whether they were made in Italy or China...But I do love these frames and they look great. Good price not to mention.,4
551691,"Although I do love the bathing suit and it fits alright. I ordered a large (I am usually a size 8) but the bottoms don't cover as much as I would have hoped, especially in the front! I'll be keeping it anyway since the price is good for what I got",3
516877,I love these leggings. they fit exactly like I hoped! They are so soft and cozy and thin for wearing in the summer. They are a bit thin where you might want to wear dark undies so you can't see them. Lol. Both me and my mother keep coming back to buying these babies!,5
431773,"Overall, I like it.  It is heavy sturdy watch so I am not afraid I will break it.  I do not like the chain - kinda cheap sounds like a chain from a hanging lamp, I do not like that the chain is permenantly attached and it is very difficult to set and wind.  The chain ring should be a bit bigger to make winding and setting easier.",3
834674,"Very soft and easy to use. My son is 7 months old and this works great for him. Colors didn't fade when washed, nor did they bleed onto other towels in the wash. Also, this did not have a bunch of fibers bunch up on it. Some children towels are very ""staticy"" when washed but this one washed just like a normal towel. I definitely recommend this cute towel.",5
157805,"This is a cute bracelet, but mine was broken in two places when it arrived - the clasp (so I couldn't put it on) and the bird charm. I knew it was cheap when I bought it, but I was hoping for at least a few wears before I had to throw it away!",1
37072,"I'm always hesitant to buy thigh hi's because I'm 5'10"" and not super skinny, therefore they're usually too short for my taste. These are awesome though, I've worn them just above the knee and also almost up to the top of my thighs, and they look great either way. Durable also, as they have gotten caught on boots a few times and haven't ripped, as most of my fishnets do. Definitely recommend!",5
707082,"The back flap button immediately fell off upon opening package, size ran small, but the kicker was the back flap IS SEWN 3/4 SHUT and reinforced, so there is no practical use (ie the whole thing has to be pulled down in order to use the bathroom). Epic design fail, as the flap is the amusement factor for a toddler. This gift falls dead flat.",1
793863,"This shirt fits me better than most shirts, even in Slim Fit Long sizing. Most brands go a little bigger in the size overall. The arms are bigger, the sleeves at the wrists are bigger, and there is more material, but this is a REALLY good Slim and Long fit for a person 6' tall with 34"" inseam and the rest of the height in the upper body. I weight 153 lbs and am thin and muscular. Fits perfect.",5
624890,"The snap-front robe was about a half size too big, but not so large that I would have to send it back.  There was a small hole in one of the pockets, but I will just fix it.  I like the seersucker material and the pink plaid with the embroidery design.  The robe is very comfortable. I needed something lightweight, but longer than a regular robe and snaps, rather than buttons or a zipper.  It was also much more economical than other robes of this style.",4
838647,I bought this for my husband for Father's day. It fit exactly as expected and he loves it. The only somewhat negative is that even though its a breathable shirt it's still on the thicker side and my husband tends to hot natured but he's still rocking it.  I'd buy it again.,5
462934,"I purchased 2 sizes above my daughter's age and it still is just a tad too short.
She is not a giant but just ever so slightly above average and I thought getting 2 sizes above would make her go through winter.

Well, nope, maybe until January and it will definitely be too short length",4
538437,"This is my 5th or 6th shirt from this brand/style, and maybe my favorite yet- they are very figure flattering. I had my 3rd baby in May and have been rocking these batwing style shirts.  My favorite thing is that with a tank underneath, not only are they cute, they are perfect for breastfeeding.  They easily transform a tank from 'I need sleep' to 'new mama sleek.'  I am size 12 or XL, 36DD.",5
548079,"I purchased these sunglasses as a lightning deal. They are a very nice looking pair of sunglasses, very stylish,  but on me they are a bit loose. When I bend over they slide off my face. I'm considering taking them to my optomitrist's office to see if they can be adjusted for a snugger fit.  I do have a long narrow face. I wear contact lenses and they are polarized and do a good job of blocking the harsh sunlight.",4
652926,"I am always skeptical about buying jeans online because I have a small waist and big thighs. These are great, they fit perfectly (zipper is a little long but not much). I am very glad I got these. Do get a few sizes up, I usually wear a 2, I got a 7 and they fit great! I'm 5'1 110lbs.",5
880821,I always wear small (I'm a 2/4 in dresses and 25/26 in jeans) and this fits perfectly. I was worried about the quality but it's amazing!!! It's super cute and actually looks just like the pics. The yellow is a pretty bright neon. I would buy this again and again.  I'm surprised and very excited,5
679593,"5'4"", 140lbs. I lift weights. As you can see, my rear and thigh departments are fully stocked. I plan to work out in these. As you can see from the photo where I'm squatting, the design does not distort, although I would still advise against dark undies just in case.",5
257186,I ordered this for Vegas it's sexy the material was enough to wrap around but I am fairly top-heavy so moving around or not having double-sided tape would be a no no I was able to tie it a couple of different ways but overall the swimsuits not for swimming unless you buy it in a dark color because the moment water hits it is completely transparent,3
746492,I absolutely LOVE THIS HAT!!! Yes I have a big head and it's hard for me to find hats that fit well. I love this hat and I'm thankful for the other reviewers that admitted they have big heads too!! I ordered black and purple and will be back for more colors. I have seen the cc hats on other people but I could never find a beanie hat that actually was a slouchy beanie on me. If you also have a big head pick a color and order now!,5
135325,"It's pretty quite.  I keep it in an wardrobe closet and never hear it.  I initially had it just in our bedroom and it bothered my wife at night, so if you are a light sleeper you should keep that in mind.  Its worked great for several weeks now and keeps my Rolex running in great time.",5
410449,"The item shipped fast, which, being from a company that sells through Amazon is great! The item was a little big for my friend's newborn son but we had no complaints. It was super soft and adorable and probably the talk of the hospital. I would highly recommend this for anyone who is into renfair stuff, viking mythos, role-playing, or metal. Truly well built, beautiful product.",4
666807,"I didn't expect anything too high in quality, and so I wasn't disappointed when the product arrived and it was cheap-looking, but still beautiful (if you don't look at the frayed ""lace"" too closely). I bought it for a breastfeeding photo shoot where I will be a little out of focus, I would not wear this in public or around people who take me seriously.",3
590211,"Got this for wife. This was way too big on her. Hood is somewhat slippery (but that might be the material). Construction seems solid.

Wife says ""do not get this if you do not have close-set boobs and a wide back"". Wife is 5'6 34A/32B. Definitely do not get this for petite sizes",3
567213,"They are well made and pretty, but they are huge. The model looks like a size 0 or 2. The socks do not fit legs for those sizes. They are very loose, and I would say easily made for an 8 or above. You have to shrink them in the dryer. They are nice, though. I wear them everyday, but they don't come as is.",3
207245,Purchased a xxl thinking since its China and I'm usually a large it would fit. I received this as either a mistake on size or horrible wrong with labeling but there is no way this is a xxl in any country...it would bro ably fit my sisters 3 year old son who wears a little boy 7 slim... Like wow picture is of the shirt next to a xxl shirt,1
541218,"The quality is awesome! I was a bit nervous about ordering, but the kimono is so adorable on! The only issue I have is it fits very large, I wish there was am XXS. I order in a China small because I was told they run way smaller then US sizes. I will be adjusting the size a bit to fit me better! I would defiantly buy from this seller again!!",5
489705,"The orange color is beautiful. Unfortunately the material is quite starchy and hard. The black section of the dress should be in the middle as shown in the photo, but mine actually came up on my breasts and I am an A cup so it seems to be poorly designed. In addition the sleeves were cutting into my underarms. The whole thing looks wrong. I had to return it. So far the seller is cooperative and is willing to refund for the dress. Return shipping will not be reimbursed.",2
249935,"I bought these for my 3.5 year old daughter, I bought size 2-3 years considering people said they ran big.
Well they were easy to get on but kept falling off as the elastic was not tight enough around her wrists and the velcro pretty much did nothing. Wish I could return them! When on though they did keep her hands warm and she liked them for playing in the snow.",2
324974,This is one of those products that if you travel you should really have.  This gives you more security and safety and can really be a asset. It is very easy to place and stays in place. Security is always good and I'm happy to recommend this product.  Product received for a honest review.,5
680186,"Really loving this bag.  The lining is light so it's easy to find things and the pockets are the best I've seen in a handbag - they're wide and deep enough so that things don't fall out.  I love that I can easily fit my ipad and a bottle of water.  The only thing missing is an outside pocket.

I will definitely order another in a different color.",5
513182,"I am an adult who wears a size 2. I bought these for my daughter's wedding. They do not buckle. They are velcro. As I was walking in them, the velcro on my left shoe became unattached, I fell, broke my elbow. Be careful. These shoes are pretty and dangerous.",3
44817,"You get what you pay for.

It was a little bigger/longer than i expected (which is my fault, i guess) but it's doing the job, and a majority of my pants stay up. I don't wear a lot of jeans so I can't give a full review in regards to that..",3
244553,The setting is amazing. The little skulls on the sides are a killer detail. Love them. The tiny stones along the band are super cute and have a lovely sparkle.  The center stone is horrible and cheesy. Looks plastic. I'm going to see if I can get another stone set in it because I really love the band.,3
680807,"It fits like a tunic that has a bit thicker material, similar to a sweatshirt. Looks great with leggings and boots. The design is whimsical and unique. It did not shrink or fade after washing a few times in cold water & drying on low and the screen printing holds up. Typically you won't find clothing that is as cheap as this is without it being a very thin material.",4
96075,"Order this, if you like to show off your curves, but I recommend you measure your body to the charts, and give yourself an extra inch or two. This dress is from the UK so, that means order one size up from your USA size. The fabric has some flexibility while hugging your curves !!!!!!!!",4
44047,"I loved the ring, it was exactly what I had hoped for. But the silver wore off on the bottom of the band, on the sides and inbetween. So because the coating wore off it is turning my finger green. I had lots of complements on it though. everyone thought it was real! Like I said, it was very pretty, maybe I just cannot wear silver.",3
721338,Has a lot of static the material is like a polyester/rayon material and I ordered an XL which fit more like a small/medium which later I learned that its Asian sizes.  Very disappointed with this purchase but the sellers are very helpful and understanding and is working on helping me exchange for a different item so I do appreciate that.,1
711612,I love this kimono!! I probably would not wear it to the beach. It's not really beach wear to me more like everyday wear. It can be dressed up or dressed down. I does cover my butt so it would be perfect with leggings. The material is soft and shiny. People have asked me if its victoria secret! For the price and the quality of this item yoy can't go wrong purchasing this adorable kimono!!,5
493167,"I love this so much more than I thought I would. For the price, I thought the material would be worse. I did rip the leg openings just a tad, but it's not noticeable. My husband loves the suit and the way it looks. It's definitely flattering. I'm 5'3"", 125 lbs, atheltic frame and the small fit me perfectly.",5
99363,"Liked it enough to keep it, but very cheap looking vinyl.  For price I guess it's ok.  Use it alot as it holds all my stuff and very roomy and I wanted that color brown which is kinda hard to find on the web.  Like the long strap too.",3
814911,Ordered this suit in a small for my 2 year old and she loves it! She normally wears a 3t. So cute on her! The tail is a bit long but she just pulls it up higher. Now mommy and baby have matching suits cant wait for the pool party next weekend!!!,5
398912,"This is a good product, but it can take a little while to hook it up to your shirt and socks.

It makes dress shirts stay tucked in and you'll look sharp.  Unfortunately, the tab design is flimsy and once you lose the tab, they don't really work and you'll have to buy another pair.",3
120082,These seem to be popular amongst a lot of the swimming classes around where I live.  Some places they are mandatory.  They seem to be good quality and do their job although they run small in my opinion.  My 2yr old daughter who wears mostly 2T and 3T clothes needed a 4T for these.,4
465209,"These are fantastic!  The material is sound, not too thick (if you're looking for super warm clothing these aren't them).  The feet on the pajamas are breathable yet have traction so my son doesn't slip around.  They fit a little small, but I realized after he wore them several times that these are actually girls pajamas, so the size difference is likely attributable to that detail.  I've had these for several months now and washed them several times and there is no pilling.  I love that!",5
70351,"Just got this today.  Read the reviews on sizing.
I typically wear a 9.5/10 regular-width shoe, so by following the reviews, I went with a size 11N (narrow).  IM SO GLAD I DID!!!!!!  They fit perfectly.  They're adorable, not too tight through the toes, perfect length, and nice and snug on the heel.
No blisters or aching feet here, and no chance these babies are going to fly off or wobble around while I'm using them.
Pay attention to the sizing on the reviews, and go up 1-1.5 sizes.",5
318554,"I rarely buy jewelry because it never seems to go with my clothing the way I want....well,  I'm wearing this necklace right now, completely forgot I ordered it until it arrived last week.  It's really pretty!  The dangling triangle gets a little lost among the girls but the rectangle on the chain catches light in a really nice way.  Really glad I purchased it, will be back for more of this style.  Its light and delicate and can be dressed up and down easily.",5
806816,"Quality is good..But little bigger for my face.

This product was received either at no or low cost for review, inspection and testing purposes. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review. If I don't like or have an issue with a product, I'll tell you.",4
809703,"Product is great for the price. I've looked at similar jumpsuits for twice the price or more in department stores. The size was also fairly accurate, but the Large runs more towards the 12 end than the 14, which is my usual clothing size. It was too tight in the hips and a bit short (I'm 5'3"") so I've returned it and ordered the XL size. I'm hoping it doesn't swallow me! Otherwise, great product!",4
664363,"DO NOT BUY THIS BACKPACK.  We bought it for our daughter for Christmas, she started using it by January 7th and it was falling apart by the end of January.  When we reported the defect to the company, they said that it we had it too long for a replacement....she used it for 3 weeks and the stitching was coming undone from the straps!  Poor quality and extremely poor customer service.  Do not buy this product and do NOT buy from this company!!",1
857900,"horrible. So, i knew it was going to run somewhat small and ordered 1-2 sizes up (i normally wear 12-14 and ordered a womens 16). HOWEVER, the ""US 16"" as actually a ""US 6"" on the tag. So if you are a zero, order a 6, and if you are a 6, order a 16. I understand when things run a little tight but this was literally 10 sizes off. horrible. Gave this to someone who is actually a 6",1
786891,"I normally wear a 1X. I ordered a 3X based on other reviews. It was still too small, especially at the bottom. I also have a fairly short torso and it still hit me between my natural waist and hips. The quality seems good and the color is nice, maybe a little darker than the picture. Unfortunately, I am going to have to return it.",2
412250,I bought these earrings an was only hesitant cause I thought they'd be too small to even make out what they were but they are a good size not too small an are crafted very well came in a timely manner I really have no complaint about these an highly recommend them,5
801924,"So the quality is great, shipping was fast and easy and the ring is adjustable so it cant for any finger and the visual dimensions are spot on. The problem is that the photo makes it look like its sold black with gold accents and this is not the case. The body of the ring is mirrored gold and the scrolling and words and window are opaque/clear. Im going to get some paint to cover the back so the scrolling/words are black at least- a little disappointing it will still work for what I bought it for.",3
171999,"I ordered this on Dec. 26th and it finally arrived on Jan. 8th. Not quite my idea of ""fast"" delivery. Then, when it arrived, one of the eyes had fallen out of it. I located the eye in the small cellophane bag and glued it back in--a process that required tweezers and some dental glue I had sitting around. Despite that, I love it. I wear it on the middle finger of my left hand. Don't know how long that will last since I haven't worn any rings for years. I don't feel good complaining since it was so inexpensive.",4
229237,"It was bigger than I expected, so it's a little loose, and the lace definitely doesn't go that low it stops just past my shoulders. I also didn't expect it to be silly, but I like it. Despite the odds, I actually really like the shirt, which is why I gave it four stars. I suggest ordering a size smaller than what you think you need though.",4
79279,i bought this or a friend around christmas time (long time ago right?) and its still holding up good.its even better looking in person only complaint is that the inside of the collar is slightly rough so if you have very sensitive skin then its not for you but im looking for a collar for myself and i will likely be buying from this brand again,5
92463,I have to say this watch delivers exactly as it's described! VERY easy to use and navigate through all its functions. I am in the Army and have recommended this watch to my entire platoon and so far everyone is satisfied. Very accurate and helpful in measuring out our workouts and setting our goals. The free downloadable software for the watch is extremely helpful in tracking and saving progress. Overall I would say this is an excellent purchase and at under $100 very much worth the money!,5
19771,"This is a great summer hat for our toddler.  It might not be the most stylish - my older kids say he looks like Mother Goose in it - but he likes wearing it, and I like how it gives his pale skin extra protection from the sun.  Paired with SPF 70, I feel fairly confident that my extra-pale baby won't be burned on my watch.  And I think he looks completely adorable in it.",5
414875,I ordered this charm for my husband for Christmas. He is a huge football fan! Thought it would be perfect gift! The price was very high so I was expecting a very nice piece of jewelry. I was not very satisfied with what I received. It is hollow and light very small hard to even see. But by the time I received it I had no choice but to give it to my husband it was Christmas Eve. So buyer beware it is very expensive and you don't get much!,2
213557,I bought this for my nephew for Christmas. It came on time and as pictured. I'm pretty happy with the quality. The fake fur is pretty soft. I bought a different trapper hat from the same company but with a nylon exterior and the fake fur isn't as nice. It's soft but I like this one much better.,5
795529,This was a gift to my significant other for his b'day. I am pleased with the look and fit of the sweatshirt and he likes it  too. I was disappointed that I paid for upgraded delivery to get it at the latest the day after his b'day.  It finally showed up 3 days later than had been stated.,3
383753,"I would have given these glasses a five had it not been that the temples are unusually short. The curves for the hinges start long before they have approached their resting part at the ear.
Yes, I have a normally proportioned face 
Other than that, they are perfect that I might decide to gift them to someone that's much younger and with smaller head proportion.",4
49518,Love this product! Just be aware I gained 33 pounds with my pregnancy. I usually fit in a size small. It took about a week for my stomach to slim down and than I could put on the belly bandit. But I'm glad I didn't go up in size otherwise it would of been too big. Better to go smaller than larger,5
765370,"I bought the houndstooth suit by the same company in size XXL so I bought the same with this one. However, strangely the bottoms of this blue and pink floral suit is too tight. Cuts in uncomfortably on my hips. BUT I will say I have wide hips (I usually wear a size 14 or XL in pants). The top was fine though (I'm a size 8/10 or M on top). I will be returning this blue floral one but keeping the houndstooth one.

*I received this item at a discount*",3
512923,"Literally, not a single part of this order was correct. I received a completely different style of suit, which is not at all what I wanted. The top is a different cut (not triangle) and the bottoms are strappy and not cinched as displayed on the model. Furthermore, the suit is visibly damaged and filthy. Are you kidding me?",1
517295,I have worn the 115 Mini-Mils for awhile now and transitioned to the coyote brown once we changed to OCP uniforms.  The only downside is that I don't think they are AR 670-1 approved yet.  No one has said anything yet but I'm waiting for the day someone says the rubber does not match the color of the leather.  Other than that they are awesome.,4
79125,"I love these shoes. I bought them in navy and wore them constantly. I'm very picky about comfort in my shoes (I blister very easily) and these are extremely comfortable. They're a touch higher than I'd like, but that's also what makes them so cute. I bought them in gold after 4 months of having the navy and the gold goes with everything. I wear a 9 or 9.5 and the 9 fit perfectly. Highly recommended!",5
650764,"You get what you pay for.  The dress, gloves and boot covers.  It is super cute to wear but cheaply made.  It's exactly as I expected it to be.  The boot covers are designed for someone with normal calves.  It will not fit large calved women. For the price, it was super cute!",4
725562,"I bought this for a Christmas gift for my daughters best friend who LOVES Totoro! It was absolutely and adorable hoodie and fit as expected. The 13 yr old who received this gift squealed with joy when she opened her gift. She absolutely loved it. I would highly suggest this as a gift for the pre-teen/teen in your love who loves Totoro. It makes an excellent gift at a reasonable price. It is well made, and there were absolutely no flaws.",5
619510,"I am a huge ""Snoozies"" fan and have several of their models. Had not tried these before, so thought I would do so. They are perfect, warm, comfortable and the non skid bottom is the best.  I am so happy with these, I know I will be ordering more soon.",5
474479,"These are great quality pants, but the image online shows them as a soft green colour with diamond patterns on it - turns out it's actually just beige/cream, with diamond patterns. I ended up being fine with it for gifting purposes, but i always prefer it to be the colour I'm expecting.",3

In case you didn't know it, but animal abuse is one of the pre-cursers to becoming a serial killer, so lets just take a ""prop"" like this, throw it out there & see if it ""sparks"" something sinister in some sicko's mind. Anyone who would buy this has to be pretty sick in the head anyway. This needs to be removed from your website as it is inappropriate for retail anywhere.",1

The pants and long sleeve shirt are that of a chubby child size. The face mask barely fit around my neck and face. My feet hang over the shoes. The over all material is very nice though. If you're a small cosplayer than this is perfect for you.",2
782080,"When I first received this cardigan, I loved it. It was thick and kept me warm. I've worn it twice, so I decided to wash it. As I pulled it from the washer, I noticed the entire side had split open. I thought it was something I had done wrong until I noticed several of the ones I purchased from Amazon had split apart. My assumption is the stitching was not done properly. I feel as if I wasted my money and now I have to go on a search for quality products. I am very disappointed.",1
292043,I bought this for my boyfriend and I put it in a cute shadowbox as a gift. He loved it! It let him live out his childhood dream of becoming a Pokemon master. My only issue is that the badges came in the box is the wrong order so I had to fix it when putting it in the shadowbox.,4
289445,"I enjoy the prints on these socks. They walk the line of not being super bright and obnoxious yet still fun and interesting. My most hated chore is folding laundry and the least favorite of the hated chore is matching socks. Buying unique socks is the only way I've found to make it easier and more tolerable. They've only gone through one wash and wear cycle, but seem to hold their shape and are quite soft. My only small critique is the one with the Statue of Liberty is a bit snug in the instep due to the print.",4
642068,"Nice fit but stretches fairly easily. Appears to go back once washed but my sons feet end up with out the gripper part on the bottom as it stretches and can be dangerous when he runs. Also, after two or three washes, it seems to fade. Not a big deal with pajamas but somewhat disappointing.",4

Firstly, I think the watch is fake and to pay more than $300.00 is a rip off. Secondly it broke after a year and since I am not in the US, I cant chance it or get it fixed. The warranty is useless.",1

I do have to say that in the last week one of the handles has had the sewing give out and the 'stuffing' is pushing out of it. I use it Mon-Fri, so maybe that's too much wear and tear on the commute. So I don't know how to rate this since it's great other than that, no warping of the bag it's self, just a handle issue that I'll have to figure out how to fix.",4
626031,I read the reviews and bought a size larger. I am glad I did. It fits perfectly. I like the just below the knee length so did not roll the top. The skirt is wide enough to cover bumps and bulges. I am sticking to the darker colors though. The fabric is thin and perfect for the South. Just don't get caught out in the wind!,4
424167,"This is perfect. I love it.
The only reason it's not a 5star rating is as follows the chain is too small. I had to replace it .
And the pearl is not round like it suggests it is . It's egg shaped.  And kind small like 4mm instead of 5mm- 7mm like promised but it's still a wonderful gift. My fiancee bought me.",4
154608,"The shoes were perfect.  I like the design.  I ordered a size bigger than my normal shoe size. They are very comfortable.  Easy to clip into the indoor spinning cycle.

862495,"These tank bodysuits are absolutely adorable! My daughter looks super-cute in them, but they are fairly thin fabric, to the point of being somewhat see-through. She runs warm, so this was not a problem for us during this hot summer, just something to be aware of. This color is a mint green, not blue.",4
2620,"I managed to get them on well enough for my costume, but thankfully Im wearing them with a long skirt. They are kinda sagging in the crotch because they are a little short in the legs and I am by no means a tall girl. They are also fairly tight with on me. They fit fine for my costume, but Im 54 155 usually a size 10 and these are pretty tight on me.",3
407264,"My daughter had one of these when she was really small and wore it everyday until she outgrew it. I ordered her a bigger one, since it's so cute. The only complaint I have is that it crumples up into a ball when you wash it - best to reshape it and lay it out to dry.",4
817592,"This bathing suit is very well made - better than some much higher-priced name brand suits I've bought.  It also looks exactly like the picture.  It runs a little small, though....i typically wear size med/large and bought the XL, based on other reviews, which fit well.  Definitely recommend (arrived super fast, too)!",5
550311,"Very cute necklace especially for the super low price.  I have to give it 4 stars because it's SO bling-y that it doesn't fit with a lot of things.  If they had toned down the sparkle factor a tad, it would have much more versatility.  For this type of inexpensive jewelry made of plastic and cheap metal it looks pretty fantastic though.",4
370977,"This wallet looks very professional and holds everything well.  I leave for an international trip next week and will be very proud to pull this out and show my extensive party how sophisticated i am.  Will definitely recommend that they purchase one for themselves.  Biggest selling feature for me is the RFID feature, the look and quality feel are gravy.  I feel safer for having this on my journeys.",5
820733,I absolutely love this shirt.  I'm not girly and its hard to find feminine cute t-shirts with style like this one.  The shirt is soft and comfortable I was worried it would feel stiff.  I have big boobs so I got a extra large even though I wear medium if fits nice I will definitely be ordering more shirts from seller.  It also came faster then expected time.,5
798940,"It's cute, but it's not the greatest material and runs EXTREMELY SMALL. I'm usually a medium on top and bottom and I literally got stuck trying to put the bottoms on and my boobs (which are not large) were almost completely sticking out. If you order this bikini go at least one if not two sizes larger. Definitely returning.",2
409656,"This is perfect plastic ring sizer .  Contained together, light and functional.  I used it for jewelry making, but great for any need to ring size.  Great price, and the product holds it's shape and value.  I would purchase this item again, and recommend for purchase.",4
180469,"Pretty classy looking...leather w/ nice stitching and all. I had an individual Belocia winder which was plastic and cheesy

I have only had it a week, but so far very quiet. We'll see how long it lasts.",4
363031,DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE A NORMAL ADULT SIZED HEAD!! I would give this zero stars if I could. There is no way they thought this wig could fit an adult. That picture is pure deception. This wig did not even fit over half of my head with my hair in a wig cap. BIG WASTE OF MONEY!!,1
76171,"If you are pregnant, you need a BellaBand!  If you just had a baby and you didn't buy a BellaBand when you were pregnant, you need one now!  This is the very best invention to help you wear your old pants, then help keep maternity pants up after you deliver, and also have an extra bonus as a modesty panel if you are nursing in public and not wearing a nursing top (so you have to lift your shirt).  Great all-around!",5
560872,The color of this dress is even nicer then in the picture. Vivid Cranberry red & a slight shine to the  fabric & both sides have the character that makes it unique/colorful. It is just so cute for young Anime fans! My daughter will wear it on her 18th Birthday bash!,5
95558,"I'd love it but I don't feel one can literally love pantyhose as they are so uncomfortable and hot ultimately.  However, these are great as far as hosiery goes.  I've also washed them in my hosiery bag in the washer a couple times and they have withstood it.",4
35396,"I read the prior reviews and was hesitant.  But, come on, for the price you get six pairs of glasses.  So far, great.  I received two colors (which is fine) and they work as anticipated.  I can carry one pair in my purse, leave one at work and one in my travel bag AND still have a backup for each.  Great deal.",5
168450,"They fit perfectly--I was concerned the Small might be too snug since I'm fuller in the hips, but they fit like a second skin without being constricting at all. These are perfect for yoga or any workout. I already own these in 4 colors. And the colors are beatiful! Love that they offer such vibrant colors at a fraction of the price",5
610016,"This cami has the expected fit for its size and the fabric is stretchy abs comfortable. For me the product itself is 4-5 stars, but I ordered size M and I received an S, so I give 3 for the service. I would normally wear S but I needed a more comfy fit now that I'm nursing. This is a good cami for an easy conversion to a nursing cami, good quality for the price, no need to shed 20-30 dollars for a nursing cami.",3
140416,"You get what you pay for.  It looks nicer than the low price, but clearly not an expensive piece.  If you have sensitive ears, I would stay away from this.  This made the perfect stocking stuffer, and a small gift for an owner of a Tuxedo cat.",4
780792,"This dress was perfect for our wedding! I definately reccomend ordering 1-2 sizes up because it ran small on every bridesmaid in my wedding party. The dress was quality- the only issue we had was the zipper was kind of hard to zip. But other than that the material was nice and the dress was well constructed. All of my bridesmaids were 5'5"" or less and the dress fell right at the knee.",4
584430,"Since the description refers to this item as a ""diaper,"" I would have thought this was a ""sack"" that the infant could be placed into. It is not.  It is basically a little blanket.  I hope it will ""fit"" over and cover my grandson as it does in the picture.  The headband is my set doesn't appear to be as fluffy as the one pictured. I may changed it out before sending it to Guam.",3
844311,"I love this romper! I am 5'5 and 170 lbs, I got the XL and it fits PERFECT! I do have 36DD though so it is a little hard to get up on my shoulders past my boobs, but once its on, it fits so nice. Also, the package shipped 2 days after I ordered it and I got it 2 days after it shipped. It arrived so fast. The material is nice, its very light and breathable, all around I think its a great product & I will be buying more in different colors! :)",5
555578,Great lightweight wools probably  best for all around winter and cold weather use. For casual wear or dress excellent. I like them so much I bought four pair!!  I recommend them but for limited outdoor use not for extended exposure but that's why I have  heavy wools!,5
818312,I was very disappointed in my swimsuit :( the material is not something you'd swim in and is poor quality. I should of read the details closer. The material fit is more that of a silk cami or thin silk slip you'd wear under a skirt. There's no elasticity at all. Very very thin.,1
235660,It's a bit too bulky for my billfold.  I am able to make use of it by doubling it backward and trimming the firm inserts to fit one wallet slot.  It will do for now but I will likely replace it soon.  The price is fine and it's sturdy.,3
380679,I love interesting clothes but sometimes its impossible to find a bra that will work. I love these. They sit perfectly against the skin and you cant tell Im wearing them. Perfect after washing. I would recommend these to any ladies looking for nipple covers. I plan to show these on my YouTube channel during a favorites video!,5
38811,"I did my search listing 'women's sweatpants' and this came a little large... I'm sure it's a man's sizing.  In fact it slips off my left foot when walking without shoes... bummer!  But it's comfy, pretty blue color (that is pictured) and warm, which is what I wanted.",4
765761,"Cute tank , very shiny polyester, I recommend air dry , becareful because it snags easy . I'm 5'4"" 140 pounds (34C) and the tank fits just right . I wear a Cami under it bc it tends to ride up during workouts . Not bad for the price but I don't see this lasting long.",3
723990,I bought this for my 12 year old.  The top might have fit her when she was 10 really small for a women's medium  the pants are a little closer to size if you would order up size for shirt to fit then pants would be to big,1
176617,"Love this product.  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because the for is small. I usually wear US medium and I recently lost weight too so I'm between small to medium, but I wanted to make sure it fits me since its a Asian size. I ordered a US large (Asian XXL) fits snug on the lower bikini part but fits well on the chest area. Otherwise, I'm happy with it.",4
566298,Cute in the front right? Yeah except when you're late to the party trying to find a safety pin to keep you shirt together just a little bit AND on top of this the shirt is boring and just ugly from the back. The front of the shirt set high standards for the back and it's just awful,1
59397,"If you live somewhere where the sun beats down on you like an abusive spouse, you can't do better than this!  White brimmed enough to shade your shoulders if you're wearing a tank top, fits big heads (I have an unusually large head - we're talking mastiff sized)  And it looks kind of funky.  I've had people stop me and ask me where I got it - not even kidding!  No matter how angry Ra the Sun God gets, you can go outside without frying your cranium.",5
265488,"Well, for $4.00 I should not complain..however, this watch was received last week NOT WORKING..surprise..surprise.  I took it to a jeweler and he said the battery was ok.  I am going to take the watch off the band and I will have a braclet.  I guess all is not lost, but it ticks me off to be scammed.  BUYER BEWARE",1
210016,"I ordered these a bit large, expecting them to shrink a bit.  They have not shrunk at all, so they remain a tad too large for me.  However that is my fault not the fault of JMS.  They are well made and wash and dry on regular settings just fine.  The fit is comfortable, and I love the fact that there is no label.  The waist and leg bands do not bind, and for a large size (size 12), this is really important.",5
89231,This shirt is very cute. I wish I wouldn't have gone along with sizing based on other reviews. I seen some say it was too long and recommended going a size smaller. I ordered a small and if I lift my arms it goes up. I should've just got a medium. Other than that it's perfect,5
310123,"I went by the size guide to choose the correct size to order for my husband. It fits him well. He thought it would've been heavier/thicker than it is, but it's a good light jacket. The only pockets are the two chest pockets, and they are pretty much useless because of the way the jacket is sewn.

I received this item in exchange for my honest review.",4
561636,"I like short dresses, that's fine.. but the blouse/dress I received does not look like the one in the picture! There is NO way I could wear it as a dress, doesn't even cover my crotch. I'm 5'4, not some kind of giant. I do not have a long torso.",2
269008,"As for the construction of these shorts, they are on par with most companies. As for the figment, they run way small. By no means would my wife be considered an XL size.... Yet the medium that was ordered wouldn't have fit someone who was a medium. Maybe small to xs woman would have fit into these shorts.",1
511939,"Love this little pill case!  So stylish as well as handy. When I travel, I keep my pills in my purse - not about to check them (too many lost/delayed luggage incidents!).  I've had issues with the lids to the compartments on regular pill cases popping open in my bag.  That won't be a problem with this case - good quality insert in a zippered case - and cute to boot!  Perfect!",5
22515,got this for our 5 month old son at the time and it fits as expected. He has a larger head and the drawstring feature on the back of the hat it awesome for enusring the perfect fit. The hat provides total coverage. We highly recommend this hat. The price is also great!,5
276523,I honestly don't know how these arw priced so low! great quality look and comfort without having to break the bank that something I appriciate as a customer and they even included a discount code for my next order. thanks I will order more shades soon with summer coming up,5
839094,"I rarely give a 1 star review, but this dress is nothing like the picture. The material is practically see through, and very cheap. And in my opinion the texture is unpleasant, I saw a review say it like wax paper and I would almost agree, the only difference is that it is a bit rougher.  The sizing seems wrong too, I ordered a small, but it's too big. I was very disappointed and unhappy. I do NOT recommend this dress at all. Hopefully  I'll attach a picture soon.",1
569860,alot of americans like the china made styles. they need to make them more american style fit. if your a small get a med. size if your a med get the large if your a large don't get it. The body is short. if your big busted don't bother with this jacket. In all together don't waste your money on it,2
59940,"The hospital recommended socks w no slip tabs for the pre and laboring mom. It allowed walks around the floor and hallways as well as tootsie warmth when all else gets exposed. These were perfect - the colors great, sock right thickness and warmth. Finally grips on socks small and allowed normal walk without too much suction problems so really worked well. Good quality and good for aftermath too.  Nice present for anyone going to hospital stay or even better around house if need to not skid.",5
414314,"For an inexpensive watch, it does just fine. As a ""specialty"" watch, it works for me. I wear a brace on my left wrist and a strap watch won't fit around the brace. I use this when I'm outdoors, hunting or fishing, and clip it through the button hole on my shirt.",5
462142,"I normally wear a small or medium and the small was way to big. Zero lift.
 I was hoping to find a low impact sports bra for for hanging out in on the weekend but this wasn't much better than no bra at all. There are normal sports bras out there that are more comfortable.",2
411207,"When I received these shoes, I was so happy. It truly is a beautiful shoe and goes well with jeans or khakis. I knew something was up when within a couple wearings the laces started to fray. One month later, and the left sole started coming off. It's a beautiful and comfortable shoe, but unless you're a cobbler, you might be in for some disappointment.",3
683801,The buckle is great exactly what I was looking for but the BELT on the other hand was one of the cheapest pieces of garbage I ever recieved!!! The belt ripped in half within an hour of wearing it right at where the hole was punched for buckle pin. I feel the belt should be REPLACED IMMEDIATELY with something of a better quality or my money should be refunded!!!,1
375799,"I ordered two, they came in quicker than expected, are too light weight for the clasp hardware, hook on for left handed, three leather lace strands are gray and the owl strand had come apart. Cute for young girls. Cheap in many ways.  You can make them a lot better using items from the local craft store. I would not order again.",2
443067,adorable boots. seemed tight on. the liner was very soft but had a hole in the toe. it moved around too much also and seemed to take up too much space. otherwise would have loved to have kept them. always buy kamik every year with the  growing feet in our house.,2
511753,"Expected 100% cotton that I could wear to work. Instead, very tight fitting almost spandex like material that wouldn't all all be appropriate for the job. Further no two shirts were the same secondary to multiple manufacturers. Would be okay for leisure but I would have needed to go one size higher.",2
664220,"Looks exactly like the picture,it's very soft, true to size and also what I like about it is that the label is on the outside so it doesn't scratch baby's delicate skin. It came with a organic cotton pouch as a gift. I gave only 4 stars because it's made with 30% organic cotton and 70% bamboo, not 100% organic GOTS certified cotton as some could understand from the description....but I decided to keep it since it's so soft",4
851653,I love this purse and I only have had the purse for over a month.  I'm very sad because the 1 main zipper broke already. When I received the purse the main 2 zippers were very hard to zip up. I would have thought for the money the zipper would last.,3
667308,"This dress is well constructed, the material is soft and stretchy and not too thick. The colors are very bold and the flower is nicely made, flexible and without hard edges. The diaper cover is made with the same material so there is no issue with seeing the print of the diaper through it. Overall I am very happy with this dress.",5
444180,"This is a novelty tee shirt and about equal to what you'd buy in a gift shop while at the beach. Lightweight cotton, made in Haiti, screen-print design.  My Son-in-Law liked it which is what was important.  I'm thinking it will shrink in the wash/dryer and be good for a few wearings before being designated as suitable to wear for washing the car or doing lawn work. Still brings a smile however.  Arrived on time, undamaged and appropriately packaged.",3
338940,"I was at a 00g when I ordered these. Popped one tunnel in my left ear the first night, slid the taper in my right ear and went to bed. I woke up and placed the other tunnel in my right ear so easily my girlfriend thought these were the wrong size! We measured and they were correct.",5
294523,"The concept is cool... If the concept worked. Maybe my ear rim (or whatever the proper term is called) is too thick. This thing was impossible to put on. I know some will have luck with it. But for me it is 1 star, there is no way to bend the metal to make a fit",1
566542,"cute little card purse - I use it for all my medical cards. Because it's so small and tightly compacted, it barely takes up any room in my handbag. Just what I needed. Love the hidden extra pocket behind the clasp, too. Very handy. Needless to say, the Vera quality is rocking as usual, and the colors are vibrant.",5
688587,"I LOVED this gown!  I bought a 14, usually wear a 12 and it was WAY to small for me.  FOLLOW the charts!  It was STUNNING though and I really wish it would have fit.  But of course, I waited too long to buy a dress and didn't have time to get another one here in time.",5
497543,"They are little dainty thing, and so are ideal for wearing at a work place, if allowed, or just out and about. The vibrant colors are a statement that can be made in a very compact design. The little case they come in is clever and useful as well.
Well worth buying if you lose quite a few nose rings because there are plenty in the package.",5
80750,"I deliberately got this shirt in a size small, as a present for my (usually) size medium fianc. It fits him very well (since it runs larger than most shirts), and he says it feels nice and soft. He is about 5 ft. 9 in., and very thin (size 30 jean), for sizing reference.",5
201579,"Is this a joke? There's ZERO support from the elasticity and the fabric is extremely cheap. I know it's an inexpensive product but the reviews had me sold. They reminded me of saggy, poor fitting mom mom long johns.. Saggy crotch and all. I'm 5'9"" 160 lbs and 27 years old",2
454361,"The wallet is well made and very, very colorful.  It includes a place to put your checks which was a bonus.  There are plenty of credit card holders and places to put money.  I would have given it 5 stars, but for me personally the colors are too bright. I think it is a great wallet in terms of functionality.",4
813709,"I haven't used these for their purpose yet (due in November 2016), but they feel comfortable and seem like they'll get the job done while being covered in all areas. Just a little smaller than I thought they'd be, but I'm also 8 months pregnant so it may have been my own bad decision making.",4
597564,If you are tiny enough for this to fit you it is not a bad purchase. But is is Asian sizing; so don't kid yourself. I am an 8/10 medium. This top in an XL would fit around me in general but it was too tight around the shoulders and arms. If you are not a skinny all over body type this is not gonna work for you. I donated the shirt to a thrift shop.,1
14923,These are my go to inserts for all of my shoes. I am a work who works 12 hour shifts. These inserts help me make it through my day without serious foot pain. My only complaint is that they only last around 3 months for me before I need a new pair.,5
252045,"I bought some after borrowing a pair from a friend at a festival. These were ridiculously thick and heavy compared to my friend's pair from a different company. These were designed badly, as the 'lens' is literally right against your eyeball. I had some friends test it to see if it was just me, but they experienced the same. The lenses are also spaced out weirdly so I could only see out of one at a time.",1
66789,I already have a set of the Scarecrow fangs I use for a Marceline (Adventure Time) cosplay. They had gotten a bit loose so I pulled out the previous fill & was able to reset them with this kit in no time. This was exactly what I expected it to be based on my experience with the fang kit I purchased previously & it did exactly what I needed!,5
55658,"These are really good durable jackets. Warm with a liner, wind resistant. Yeah I've got another brand also of a different color, but for a few bucks more this is way superior and also comes in tall size, which some others don't. The inside pocket is handy. The ability to use a liner makes these kinds of jackets very versatile, spring, winter, fall. Tough stuff.",5
306039,"Love love love these work out pants! My boyfriend bought these for me and these are some of the most comfortable workout pants that i own now. Affordable price, fast shipping, come in a bunch of different colors. They are very stretchy and light weight, good material that breathes, i highly recommend purchasing a pair of these. I know that i am looking into buying a few more colors!! Thank you so much!",5
156989,This is a pretty not real functional.  This wallet should only be advertised for those that want to carry the absolute minimum in a fashionable way.  I gave mine away and bought the SHARKK.  I would also not suggest this for a man who carries his wallet in the back pocket.  the corners are not rounded and perhaps over time would cause damage to your pants from sitting.  Probably best for business cards only.,3
478353,This was a fairly expensive scarf...and I expected a quality looking product. The edges of the scarf look unfinished.....there is a single row of stitching along raw edges to hold them in place. If one of those stitches breaks.....you will end up with a ball of expensive yarn. Expected better,3
3634,"This is a gorgeous costume that is well made.  My costume does not have a zipper closure but I could pull it over my head without it stretching out of shape.  The cape is light weight but I think it will be fine and sort of ""billow"" when I walk which will add to the aura of the costume.  The arm guards, crown, and belt are light weight but they are shiny and will suffice, however I did order metal ones to use instead.  I love this costume!!",5
110228,Ordered this for my husband.  He loves it!!  We have a sauna and he uses it everyday after sitting in the sauna.  Its absorbent and comfy.  I bought him a robe from our local BBB but it wasn't terry cloth.  He didn't like it so I found this one.  Wish I had come to Amazon first.,5
196343,"Really nice considering the price! Feels like a swim suit, true to color. The only problem I had was the cup part of the top is really stiff, I'm flat chested so it was kind of big on me and looked like I stuffed my bikini top! I can deal though, I like it!",4
148237,The ring has a gray tone but mostly it is a nice polish that has a white overall look. It definitely has a nice hefty weight to it.  We are buying it as my fiance's wedding band.  He likes the comfort fit.  The size does run a bit bigger than we expected.  We have been trying on different size to find the right fit.  Definitely a great company though!,5
378859,"Love it! Originally bought it for a cosplay costume, but I love it so much I wear it almost all the time. I'm full figured, so I was worried about the sizing, but I found that the XL fit just right. I'm a 40C and I can button it up without pulling on the buttons, while still maintaining a snug & flattering fit.",5
516242,"Got this as a present for my wife. Looks just as picture. The scarf is not recommended for those who are looking for something to keep them warm, it is definitely more for style and for looks. Classic infinity scarf, definitely recommend for someone who is looking for one in this type of style and color.",5
688918,"I bought this product for my husband, I bought an M size, and it was small for him. So we have to exchange the product for a bigger size, and I just have to say that the service and assistance from Aptro's team were just fantastic. My experience was great with them, and we loved the product too. It looks nice on my husband.",5
399630,"I always wanted one of these, but in golfing stores they were just too expensive. So it's Nice to find one in ""Amazon"" that isn't. It appears that it is well made and should last me for several years. The Proof will come this summer when I wear it, but I'm NOT expecting any problems at all.

I will say too that it's closure at its rear is the cheaper Velcro and not an adjustable buckle that I would have preferred, but it's OK. Would I buy another? Sure, if I ever need another.",5
661685,"This dress was a hit of my summer. By far the best summer dress I've had in a while. I wore it to dates, cocktail parties and even a wedding. The best 18 dollars I've spent all summer. The belt gave up by September but I was wearing this dress a lot so I'm not surprised. Highly recommend this dress. Can't wait to wear it again next year!",5
803126,Its cute and all. Im 34B and usually fit a large in bottoms. I got the XL according to the size chart. bottoms were ok but felt like if i went swimming it could reveal too much. The top was just too big in the breast area. I just returned it,2
315563,Received the bag quickly!  It looks great.  Because of past reviews I loaded it down and rolled it around for a while to see it there were any problems with the extending pull handle or the wheels.  Not one problem!!!  Appears  to be a great product which I will be using to travel from the east coast to the west coast next week!!!,5
564180,"The dress is really pretty. The color is exactly what it looked like in the picture. The only slightly down side. We sent my daughters exact measurements, for a ""custom fit"" and the dress was three inches too big in the waist and three inches too long. Still had to make alternations.",4
259435,"I had to cut out the underwire to get the top to fit my chest, but I am also a 34DD so that was expected. Otherwise it's a really cute swim suit. The biggest problem I had besides the under wire was that when you unzip the bottoms they don't open wide like in the picture. They pretty much close on your hips, and I really liked how it looked while open in the picture. The colors are bright and it's other wise made very well out of sturdy materials.",4
250323,"I like that the shoe horn has two levels to lengthen it.  To lengthen, just pull out to one click and out again to another.  The only thing I don't like about it is the spring between the handle and horn.  It causes the horn to bend when you really need it to remain still while trying to put your foot in a shoe.  I might return it though.",4
744275,"The top of these socks are more square than others I have tried, which I like because the corners don't show when I wear them with loafers.  They are small, and I wouldn't recommend them for anyone over a size 8-  even an 8 is pushing it.  The heel stays on pretty well.  I machine washed them, and they came out fine.  I like the colors!",4
59546,"Great apron. Stays black, doesn't pill. Being reversible is very cool. Adds a bit of bulk though. Pockets are great, useful and it seems to be made well. I haven't used it long though, so we will see. Many of my coworkers ordered one or two after seeing mine. ONE IMPORTANT thing. DO NOT ORDER from chefworks. They will rip you off. They charge TWICE THE SHIPPING AND HANDLING, and take a long time to send. I ordered direct from amazon, and received in two days.",4

429160,I was kind of dissappointed in the first ring because the middle gem came out I'm guessing during shipping. But West Coast Jewelry is nice enough to send a new ring in. This will be for my wife for christmas also. I say go with West Coast Jewelry if you want nice stainless steel rings but make sure they all have the Spikes logo engraved in the band.,5
883333,"I ordered a Small and at 5'3, 135 lb, and cup size B this was WAY too Baggy in the chest. The rest of the outfit was a bit larger on me. The arm bands are CRAZY itchy and I had to staple them so they would stay up on my arm but not break off if I had to use some muscle, but its a cute outfit overall for the price. Had to pin the chest portion closed in order to not show the world my chest. Fine for Halloween.",3
122732,"So I ordered this wallet due to my phone wallet breaking apart. It really is a great product and I've enjoyed having it now as my wallet.

Cons: Since I've had it for about a week I can't find any cons

Pros: The brown is a really nice color and the branded Alpine Swiss and Genuine leather is a really nice touch.
  The inside of the wallet where the Paper currency goes is a really soft suede inside.

If you are looking for a low priced but high class feel wallet I would definitely recommend.",5
866384,"This is the second pair that I bought.  The first one at Nordstrom and when I saw they did not have it any more I came to Amazon.  Both times these earrings break, the quality is very weak.  I like the design so much that I would buy a third pair but knowing they will break again, I won't; do it",1
175667,"The outer shell fits perfect but the under garment is loose and baggy, as though it was sewn on backwards. I am keeping the suit and will wear a pair of shorts with them as too much is revealed to just wear the suit without some type of cover up. I was very disappointed as this suit was to be my main one in Hawaii  but I couldn't wear it out of the hotel room.  I do not recommend this suit due to poor construction of under garment.",1
693309,"Nice stitching, fabric, and good quality but the colors are atrocious. This dress is not a pastel soft colored dress like how it is portrayed in the picture at all. The colors are bright and obnoxious and don't go well together at all. I Will not be wearing this ever.",2
39458,"These are awful!  Someone described them as harem pants!  Yes, for an elephant!  The legs are enormous!  THe  fabric started to ""pill"" after first wash.  I would be ashamed for my husband to wear these out to the mailbox!  They were cheap, but I have bought cheap before and been satisfied. However, these look cheap.  There is a difference. Cmon Hanes, really!",1
395067,"It's been several months since I owned this and it still smells like rubber tire.  It is a huge bag for what it's worth.  Check the dimension.  I haven't tried washing it yet, maybe that might get rid of the smell.  One shouldn't have to wash a duffel bag to get rid of the stench.  Quality-wise it's not a Samsonite.  More like something you'd find at Walmart.  Well I guess you get what you pay for.",2
134317,"I saw these at Target after I was told I would need glasses and I loved them instantly. Target did not carry my insurance, though, and was much pricier. I ordered these and my eye doctor was able to put the lenses in without any problems. I do need to go back, however, and get them adjusted because they keep falling down my nose. But I get tons of compliments on them and love the way they look.",5
141778,"The first day I used the tote bag the shoulder strap broke, because it is cheap plastic, like all of the metal looking pieces are. One of the reasons I bought this was because of the cross body strap. Very disappointed it didn't last even 6 hours before it broke.",2
476760,"I purchased the Green/Black. This is more of a teal green than a forest green, and is very true to the online photo. I really love the feel--very soft. It is thin (not see thru) but I bought it for fashion, not to wear in place of a coat LOL. I have purchased several Shawls from this company and they are all top quality (no defects) and lovely colors.",5
30047,"I just received my ring and one thing i do agree with is that you should definitely order one size up from what you normally where, but other than that i found it very pleasing. The stone is a true rainbow of colors and it is a very smooth stone so you don't have to worry about it catching on your clothes or hair. It is a ring finger ring though, so don't try wearing it elsewhere it is to delicate for that",5
200911,"I bought these for my niece who hasn't made her grand appearance yet. In comparison to a 1 year olds head, it looks like it will fit a new baby perfectly up until they are maybe 6 months old or so. They are tied together and secured very well. The material is very soft and not ""rippled"" which I am VERY happy with. I hate seeing little baby heads wrinkled from their little headbands. These are a must have for every little girl. :)",5
543853,"Awful! The pic shows this as a long maternity shirt, but it's not! I ordered it for my daughter, who at the time was only 15 weeks pregnant. She's normally a size 2 and tiny, but she could barely get this on. It is NOT a maternity shirt and fits like a Youth Large, which is very weird considering that the design is clearly meant to be for pregnant women. Google Harold from ""Hey Arnold"" and you'll have an idea of how this fit her -- too tight and too short. The quality isn't good either.",1
777214,"I like this sweater. It's soft, cute and warm. However, I was heart broken when I saw that the original one from Brandy Melville is only 8 dollars more expensive than this one with a cupon that I have. For that reason I think I'm better off returning this one and getting the other one. The alien was at a slightly awkard position, but I recommend buying if you want to save a couple bucks.",4
337186,I purchased this item with a small discount. I am pleased with the glasses and it is the first of its kind that I have purchased. It is well made and very attractive. I like the bit of flash with the playful mirrored color. Perfect for a no make up day and out in the sun.,5
72666,"I purchased this cloak for my dragon obsessed 5 year old nephew. He loved it. It is easy for him to put on himself and he loved playing imaginary games with it. So far it seems to be durable and made well. There are loops at the tips of the cape where they can hold it to make the ""wings"" fly out.",5
178796,"Not bad for the price, the material of the suit exceeds my expectation. Although I would suggest sizing up TWO sizes. I am typically a large and I went with an XL because of the reviews. The top fits perfect (not heavy chested) but the bottoms are a little snug. I would send them back if it wasn't such a hassle. Though, they are a bit difficult to get over my hips, I am still able to wear them.
Bottom line: if you have big hips like me, go TWO sizes up from what your typically wear.",4
447032,"The wig looks much cuter in the picture. What arrived as similar, but the pigtails are matted ratty balls of hair and the wig base is too small for my head. There's nothing in the wig netting either to attach it securely so I ended up having to use bobby pins. If I am able to untie the pigtails and comb out, it might look better, but it definitely could use some work.",3
774485,"If you get to the reviews my guess is that you will not buy it because this is an awful product. I wear a small, not even a large would fit me of this shirt. Cheap looking, color is nothing like the picture. So sad that people sell such bad quality and wrongly sized clothing online. Don't buy this product!!",1
454505,"This is a nice sweater, but for some reason, looking at the limited photos, I imagined somewhat heavier weight. As the other reviews noted, the sleeves are rather tight also. I think that I will hand wash the sweater and attempt to ""stretch"" the sleeves a bit and hope that helps.

Lightening fast shipment though and great communication!",4
693932,"I'm 6'1"" with an 18"" inch neck and I usually have to make regular ties several times before I get the right length. This results in a very short rear tail.  I did not have that problem with this tie ... It was the perfect length.... Nice color and material.  I am ordering another.",5
591811,I've been wearing Fit Over glasses for many years as my eyes are too sensitive to sunlight to allow me to wear most prescription sunglasses. Plus it's more convenient to me to keep my glasses on and just put on or take off the sunglasses. This is by far the most attractive set of Fit Over glasses I've ever bought - the print is subtle and they look like traditional sunglasses. Love them.,5
457019,"The bag is ok but not at all what I expected. The material is much too stiff for Everyday work bag. It is beautiful for a special occasion but I wanted it for my everyday use. The side pockets are practically useless for my bottled water because it is so rigid, but can hold smaller items if needed.",3
497762,"I've had it about a month and the outside print is coming off, so you can see the white through the spots where it's *supposed to be* black. It bums me out. Also, the outer likes to suck up the color of the purse liner it's in :/ but it's still an item I get lots of compliments on.",2
100475,"I love this wrap, good quality material, wide enough  to go around my shoulders.  I ordered this wrap to wear to a formal gala with my gown, I  did not want to pay a lot of money, so I ordered this wrap.  The reviews that I read was not bad.  What an investment.  Not bad for the price, you can't go wrong, I  highly recommend the purchase of this wrap.  The shipment arrived in about two days after I made the order, not bad.",5
564413,"You definitely get what you pay for here.  The metal is cheap and feels light in the hand, but the buckle actually looks quite nice - very sleek.  Its smaller and more subtle than Id imagined, so don't worry if you think it will be to big.
Functionality wise, its pretty average.  Nothing special here - just a plain, matte black buckle; as advertised.",4
184885,"Great bag, zipper is little off it doesn't run through all the with of bag but it is not a big deal to me anyway. Handles are good and all hardware hold up great. I took it for vacation trip use it for my airplane aditional carry on with tons of things in it. Changing the planes and hotels several times always with maximum stuff packet in that bag. No problems still good as new",5
11237,My go-to inserts. Many pairs later I'm still a consumer. I've seen others and been suggested others but once you've found something that works it's hard to go with something else. I work as a retail meat cutter for 8-12 hours at a time. Periods of standing in place interspersed with lots of walking. The inserts work great for either level of activity. I have these in all of my shoes and boots.,5
289584,"These are well made. I was expecting them to be worse quality because of their price, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I just received them so I don't know how durable they're going to be but so far I'm impressed.  The colors are very vivid and didn't bleed when I washed them.  I wear a size 8.5-9 in womens and they fit perfectly.",5
531373,The feather is fantastic. I was looking for one that didn't look like a leaf and I am happy I found this one. The bail is large so I could switch chains easily. The one it comes with is dainty but I might want to put it on a heavier chain.,5
745860,Very good quality cashmere sweater and shocked by how well it was priced. Very soft but also durable and the color is perfect. I ordered the coral color and it was true to description. Fit is a little small. I ordered a small and it fits well but a little snug. Order a size larger if you're going for a looser fit.,5
795251,"I love this. I am 5'7, 166lbs 36D and I got a xl. Shows my shape of my body and hides my little love handles. Very cute and sexy at the same time. The top is a little hard to snap in the back so I have to snap it then put it on over my head. Other than that I'm so glad I bought this.",5
759093,"First, I must say that this is a beautiful coat, the price is very reasonable, and the quality of this coat is very good.  Unfortunately, for me the coat was not even close to being my size.  I would guess that an average size person might want to get two sizes beyond their normal size.  I really wish that this coat would have fitted.  A quality item!",2
565036,"This looks nice, but it was very flimsy. I could bend it with my hands with little effort. I've purchased other buckles in this style in the past (from other sellers), and the quality was much higher. It was intended as a Christmas gift, but I ended up giving something else as a gift. I just gave them this to the side. I doubt it is going to last for more than a few months.",2
65209,"My girlfriend bought these and is quite satisfied. She says they're very light and smooth, and come in a large variety of colors and designs. Her only gripe is that they seem to get food and even sugars from drinks to stick to them. In that regard, it seems that metal piercings tend to do a little better at staying clean for longer periods.",4
210900,I received this in earlier this week and I absolutely LOVE it!!!!  It fits higher up on the neck so you can wear it actually with any neckline shirt/blouse.  It is heavier than what I anticipated for what I paid for it.  I may have to order a few more as gifts!!!,5
599666,"These are my favorite sneakers!  I did not have to break them in and they fit perfectly!  I am a size 8 with a narrow foot.  My daughter is a size 8 with a wider foot and this sneaker fits us both perfectly.  I receive compliments on them each time I wear them.  Great shoe for travelling, too!",5
456993,This a very pretty umbrella! I especially love that it dries very quickly. It's compact enough to fit in my purse so I can easily carry it with me. Clearly an umbrella for one person which is great when walking in a crowded area. It opens and closes easily. I highly recommend this product as much for its appearance as for its functionality.,5
608767,"At first i was very pleased with this bag. Beautiful dark blue, silver trim tons of space and fit perfectly under the seat on southwest. However the second time I went to use this one of the zipper pulls broke off, with little to no force to close it, and it behaved  like cheap silver painted plastic.  What a piece of junk. Buyer beware",1
28699,"Don't go with the in store brands that have flashy displays. These are by far and away the best orthotic inserts I have used. Great for people with flat feet who spend a lot of time standing. As a medical professional spending a lot of time in the hospital and inpatient setting, they were a lifesaver.",5
584234,"I was looking for a ring like this one.  I was absolutely thrilled to find a company that sold this ring!!!!!!

397966,"Shrinks in the wash.  Quality of material is not plush like some other terry sleepers, but is thin and cheap feeling.  Cheap snaps make it difficult to snap shut on a wiggly baby!  Stick with 100% cotton sleepers - like the ones from Gerber.

The only frustration I had with the dress is that the length was not nearly long enough to wear with heels. I am 5'5 and I had to wear flats and the flats still showed more then I was hoping.",3
740788,"My daughter shined at her 8 th grade formal. Her teachers barely recognized he. She was stunning. She normally doesn't care for dresses , but this one had pockets so she loved it. She said the pockets were big enough for her phone and lip gloss. She had a really good time and was able to dance all over the venue comfortably",5
544959,"Despite ordering according to my daughter's measurements, it was too large and I had to take it in at several spots. The sequins scratched up her arms and were uncomfortable. She wore it once to HomeComing and many beads and sequins fell off and at 2 sites entire strands of them came apart.",2
232814,"Loved this wallet before it failed- but it is not built to last! The wallet encouraged me to slim down the number of cards I carry, cut down on cash, and just not have to deal with a George Costanza wallet anymore. However, it cannot stand up to the wear and tear of daily use. The elastic band on my wallet is shot and the wallet no longer holds cards inside- in less than a year.. Crabby's wallet is a great idea, but other companies probably execute much better.",2
624957,"It is cute I'll give it that. It's cotton and pretty soft. But it runs too small. I got the 24mos one and my one year old barely fit in. And I guess they didn't use good dye. Its color fade after the first wash, and I use baby detergent with gentle circle.",3
493495,"I read all the reviews and noted that the shoe seemed to be a bit snug. As there were so many people saying this I decided to go 1 size up and Im really glad I did. I think its because they are canvas though. I have had many suede shoes over the years including Puma's (I upgraded to these from my suede Puma's) and my 10.5 suedes are perfect.
theyre a really well made shoe and very comfortable; Im wearing them as I type and have been wearing them all day. Recommended",5
858106,Ordered for a Halloween costume and probably won't wear it for any other occasion. Normally wear small/medium depending on the brand. Ordered a medium and it fits okay. The neck is very high and it fits around my neck about as tight as it can without choking me. It is a little short and VERY SEE THROUGH! Definitely can't wear this alone. I ordered some nude leggings to try underneath so I will see if that is good enough. Probably also need a slip or something else for the top part as well.,3
48240,"Perfect stretchy belt! I got it for my boyfriend and he loves it. I would agree with some of the other reviewers who said they run a bit small... usually my boyfriend wears a 34 in jeans and I got a 36 in the belt, and it fits just right.",5
300865,"Lovely tooled leather, though I was concerned to see there were no credit card slots.  I was able to find inserts for the credit cards, however, and am happy to have kept the checkbook.  The seller was prompt with answers to questions.  Loved this product so much I went to their website and may be doing more gift shopping with them.",5
50596,I love the classic and very trendy look. The first time I tried these on I knew I had to have them. When I finally got them it was reconfirmed they are for me. I have a round face so the shape of the frame fits well not to tight like some frames. The quality is definitely shown threw the craftsmanship of the frames.,5
538559,"Lightweight fabric, feels nice . Love the border print and the sleeves . There are no buttons so I sew the neckline shut for an inch so it would not fall open to deep. Good quality allover. I am 5.5, 116lb , XSmall usually and this small fits perfectly, not tight, just right.",5
71317,"A tie that should be worn with the right shirt for the right occasion.  I normally wear more subdued colors and conservative patterns.

The quality is excellent and appears more outstanding when you receive it.  I plan to wear it with either a white with blue windowpane shirt or a darker solid blue shirt.  I am considering what it might look like paired with a nice faded denim shirt.",5
406810,"Wore this on the beach in Mexico and loved it!!!My wife also wears a thong,so I figured to give it a try. Fits very snug to your cock and balls,yet is very comfortable. The thong in the back is also very comfortable-this suit will get you a few looks (weather you want them or not),but if you are buying this suit I'm guessing you won't mind people looking. Go ahead and give it a try-I'm sure you will like it-I know I do.",5
39691,"These socks work well with the smaller hand warmers but you need boots that are a little large, so you can get everything in the boot easy and are comfortable.  Sock is made good and take your time getting them on, only when you arrive at a spot where you plan to fish or where you plan to walk in.  if you get to your spot early, you can put them on over your thin socks and not give them a chance to sweat your feet on the walk.  Good Luck",4
637882,"The shirt looks cuter in the picture then it does on. The shirt fit well in the chest area and above however the bottom seemed a little big and not as flattering. I'm not a fan of the lace being longer than the undershirt. The button on the back collar popped off the second time I was putting on the shirt which was a bummer but it didn't seem very secure when I received it in the first place. It's an alright shirt and I'll still wear it but if I could do it again, I wouldn't buy it.",3
731419,"Fits good but I think it shows where my hips are but everybody else disagreed. Also when I wore it, it ripped in two spots at the top where the black and white meet, and the material is hard to see because it's so sheer. I usedclear nail polish to stop the fray and was thinking about putting something on to cover the holes.",3
296381,"I don't usually write reviews but I have to say... These boots are AWESOME!
I needed them for a 3 day music festival. They worked with every outfit, protected my toes from being stepped on & I didn't get ""Festy Feet""! The heel is perfect for a little height & they are so comfortable! The fringes are cool. They're made very well! I normally wear a US size 7, but after reading other reviews, I ordered a 7.5. They hug my feet perfectly. I wore little no show sports socks with them.
Got tons of compliments! Worth every penny!",5
233409,This is a statement peice. All stones are soft and amazing color! From the clip in the back to the smallest stone this is beautiful. The clip in it's self is stunning and easy to use! I've yet to own jewelry with that particular clip and it's elegant. Thank you! I received this fir a discount and worth every penny!,5
422793,"It's for my son, who takes Japanese in school, a tutor at home, and loves the culture.

Fits well, nice quailiy, good look, thanks!",5

Although both are pretty, I had a real problem trying to get the LaGouMai top over my head because the neck opening was too small. I got a headache trying to force it anyway. I am not sure the others one they have are like that or maybe I had a defective one, but LaGouMai refunded me and did not bother me with return shipping fees, and whatever. Thanks LaGouMai, the two stars are for your consideration with this item.",2
158354,"This dress is very flattering on and extremely comfortable.  The material is stretchy but thick enough to hold everything in tightly :)
I am 5'-7"", 130lbs and the small fit perfect.  You can control the depth of the V neck by pulling up for more coverage or pulling down for a deeper V which is nice.
Great price.  Great dress.",5
475163,"I love that it zips higher so you don't have to wear a scarf. I think the zipper pockets is a great plus. The only downside is the hood could fit a little better, I feel like it sits further back than I would expect.  Also wish there were black ones left too.",5
726000,There were only three reviews when I purchased this bag ~ one reporting an issue with a zipper.  I thought perhaps it was just a fluke . . . but my bag arrived with a broken zipper (zipped half way and not budging).  So now 2 out of 4 reviewers report zipper issues.  Probably not a fluke . . . and most definitely not a bag I'll be buying again (returned the one I had).,1
143785,"It stayed in place when I first tried it on and walked and sat. It fell down when I ran and squated. So I guess depending on your expected activity it could work for you. I don't want to use it for touring the city, may have to run to catch the subway.",3
484335,"What Key-ring?
This soft and lovely scarf arrived sans the mentioned ""key-ring.""  I gave it to a friend who wears more scarves than I do.  It took over a month to arrive, which interfered with my plans to use it  s a Christmas gift.  Why does this take so long to get to0 me?  No one had an answer for that.
That said, this is a beautiful scarf and well worth the excessively long wait.",3

One shirt was 6"" wider and 3 "" longer than the other one, and neither one fit correctly. I have tried to find someone at Cactus Bay Apparel to email about this but there is nothing on their website. I love the look of many of their shirts, with the design covering the back and front, but I can't waste more money on these when I can't count on the sizing.",2

The fabric is a thin, non-stretch. The belt does not have any interior structure or support. The skirt is a slim a-line style and is not the circle skirt that it appears to be. While it did look decent on and fit properly, it was not right for my needs. The company selling the dress was very understanding and easily returned my purchase for a full refund.",3
539003,"Very nice for the price. Just keep in mind that the stones are glued on and will pop off if they get caught on a shirt or jacket. If you want a nice looking winter necklace, this is for you. If you're looking for high end jewelry, you'll be disappointed.",4
522533,"It's really thin. When I walked outside today in the rain, I felt like I was getting rained on. I feel like I can't really give a good review b/c my hair stopped my hood from fitting. It's really lightweight, though. I bought it b/c I always forget my umbrella. So, it met its needs.",3
148120,"This ring is incredible! It keeps its shine and no one even knows it is white tungsten. The only downside to the ring is that it is quite heavy compared to white gold. Your finger adjusts to the weight after a while, so please don't let that discourage you from buying this. I would definitely buy this product again. I've had it for a few months now and I never take it off! There is no wear and tear or discoloring on the ring.",5
127995,"This is a GREAT jacket. It fit perfectly and it doesn't make me feel like I'm wearing a tent. For reference I am 5'11"" and 189 pounds. It didn't leak and was really good during storms. I just wish it was a bit warmer, but what can you do with that price.",5
694484,"I read the reviews that it was ""smaller"" so I ordered the medium, well.. I could and probably should have went with the small instead. it still does the job though! not as long as It looks in the picture. For the price, id say this is well worth the money",4

And if I pulled them down to my hips the crouch gets all bunched up, just don't buy these I am returning them.",1
342894,"Love this shirt! It is shorter than expected, but it is a crop top, and I should have assumed that. I usually wear a medium, but I bought a large and it comes down to my belly button, but it fits like a charm. Really well made and super cute!!",4

The other problem is the edges....cut rough, rather rough finishes and so it easily gets cut on your clothing, no matter the fabric, lace material is the worst. So u can imagine wearing your wedding gown which is already lacy in nature...it will be a total mess to have the veil bunched up at the back. they need to work on the trimmings and make the edges smoother and the veil fuller.",2
283319,First off I never like myself in swim suits.  Lol this one is comfortable and easy to get on.  My bust is 34 waist 28 .. I ordered a medium.  I'm 5 foot 5. The material on the bottom is thin.  It snags easy on rough swimming pools.  (sitting in the hot tub) it's cute though. I wish the front (I thought it would've been more like a panel.  Is just loose.. So actually brings attention to my belly. But overall very flattering and received a lot of compliments,4

The socks were a little tight around the thigh but I have bigger thighs for my body size (I am a 10 and it fit me fine).

Also wanted to mention that this was discreetly packaged which was very nice.",5

Also the fur initially went everywhere when opened and there were no cleaning instructions with it but it looked amazing.",4
871328,"Cheap quality.  There's a reason that the price is so cheap, but I don't even think it's worth more than a couple dollars.  I returned mine due to poor quality.  And while I was aware of it, but thought I'd give it a try anyway - be sure that you know this is NOT an Alex and Ani.  The charm is made of plastic.",1
840536,"Even though it states that it fits small it was still too small.  I wear a medium in blazers and purchased an XL preparing for it to be big.  It was the right size for my 18 year old 89 pounds daughter.  I purchased this for my mothers' funeral, her favorite color.  To say that I am disappointed is an understatement.",1
165289,"I own lots of yoga pants/leggings from many different brands. In comparison to others, these are just okay. Very tight feeling, nylon-like fabric. I wouldn't describe it as soft, but it's not scratchy. I also don't think it keeps you very cool. I have better yoga pants from other brands that actually cost less. Meh, probably won't buy these again.",3
179264,"These sunglasses are attractive and do fit over my glasses and block the sun, but they are huge!  They barely fit into the overhead holder that my car has for sunglasses.  I have had other fit-over sunglasses, and, even though those came in a couple of sizes, none of the choices I shopped for in person was as large as these. Since I only use the Sun Shield when driving, I have decided that I will just pretend I am movie star while in my car.",4
638609,"Way too small. Slightly larger than my toddler. Smaller than my size 4 lace top similar to this one. It does smell awful. I'm sure the smell would disappear after a few washes. For sensitive skin it does not seem to bother me. But, again, way too small. Not at all like the picture.",2
123889,"Dried fast after wearing it in the pool.  Wish the brim was a bit larger.  Velcro much easier to use then
a tie.  A good purchase.  My one year did NOT get any sun burn on her head in HI because of this hat.  Excellent price.",4
94966,"Nice belt but I received it out of the package. It was by itself in the box, with the bag it came in and the tag separated from it. I was disappointed about that, the belt was in a fairly okay condition. Had it been in the package, it would not have looked like a second hand belt.",4
572214,"My almost 4 year old was super excited to get this, she loves everything Elsa. Not the greatest quality, the crown is 2 part and sometimes detaches. The braid is long and pretty, but it was just one of those snap clips, so it would slide a bit- my daughter's hair is super soft and slick I used bobby pins to make it stay better in her hair. Like I said, not the greatest quality but my daughter loves it.",4
276146,They feel kinda cheap and flimsy like the lenses might pop out. But the lenses are very dark and they look very stylish! Not horrible for the price but I wouldnt recommend buying if you're hoping to find glasses that feel high quality. Purchase if you want glasses that look like raybans but wouldnt be too upset if you lost/broke them.,3
260872,"5'6, 155 lbs, I am 15 lbs heavier then my normal weight. I ordered a large loved the dress. Was little tight for a large, but it is a tight fitting dress. Beautiful! Loved it :) It would look better if I didn't have a muffin top going on, that's not the dresses fault.",5

Baby was about a month old.

Updated review:
My baby is now 2 months old and they look so nice.  I think my previous review was due to user error.",5

I ordered a size 6 thinking they would be way to small in the his well they are huge but super tight on the legs and really tight in the crotch area.. really!? I am 5""6 and about 110 so its not that i cant fit in them.. I would not waste your money on these...",1
413416,"Usually these opinion/reviews blogs are typically littered with unsatisfied customers sounding off on a products they didn't like. It's not often enough you hear positive reviews or opinions about good products. I wanted to quickly weigh in on the New Era New York Mets Infant White Baby Bucket Hat.

It's an excellent Spring/Summer hat; lightweight and breathable on those hot summer days you want sun protection for your little one's face. It arrived via the mail on time and we were very satisfied with the package material.

It's a must have for all those infants whose parents are diehard Met fans!!",5
598183,"I ordered a medium and it appeared to be a bit large when i first took it out of the package, but after putting it on i found that it worked out just fine anyways. This shirt gets a lot of attention, so if you don't want eyes on you then definitely look elsewhere. A good purchase, i would recommend it to anyone.",4
7859,This is a very nice slip.  My daughter's 3 yrs old and I bought her a size 4 to 6 because someone else said to buy a size bigger in their review.  I'm happy I listened to her because it does seem to run a bit small.  I also suggest going up to the higher size.,5
106096,"This is a very pretty dress and is a beautiful color. The dress fit me perfectly at 5'4, 120lbs, B-bust. The buttons near the neck are a little hard to button but are as cute as can be! I like this dress a lot better in person than pictured here.",5
656472,"I'm so disappointed with this underwear. I thought they'd look great and fit really well, but I was very wrong. The mesh feels super cheap and the black color will rub off onto other fabrics. It ruined my white comforter. I could barely get these to fit as well. Super small.",1
583005,"My dear husband moved to his new home in Heaven ten months ago. Calla lilies were our flower. My husband would always purchase them for me, so when I saw this pendant I had to get it! This pendant is absolutely beautiful! I got so many compliments the very first time I wore it. The only thing I noticed is that the calla lily was not positioned in the teardrop exactly like the picture, but I still love it! I would have loved  matching hanging earrings to go with it and it looks great with a gold chain also!",5
764590,"The dress was made of cheap material, not true to size. I ordered a size 4 and it was more like a 2. The zipper is flimsy and EXTREMELY difficult to zip. I am returning this dress and buying from another seller due to the harassment from the seller about my first one star rating that I was asked to delete and refused so the seller deleted it so that buyers will (like me) make the same mistake of buying a poorly made garment and be upset, only to be harassed via email from the seller.",1
97101,I always have trouble with tops not being long enough because I have a longer torso. (but I am not tall) this top is nice and long and I bought a medium. I have broad shoulders and this top isn't tight on my shoulders. I is very flattering and I really like the elastic band at the bottom. I think it adds to its flowy-ness which I like a lot. Took forever to get to the states but it was worth the wait!,5
269316,"Spent a lot of time with this, but It just is not possible to change the ""day"",- so if the date is correct, the day of the week if wrong. I bought this for my 88 year mother to keep track of the date and day of the week-so am very disappointed. Don't waste your time with this.",1
21475,"I bought a 0-6 months for my 4-month-old. She has an average head size.

The hat fits her perfectly. There is room for her to continue to grow, but it isn't too large for her. (There is a string on the back to adjust for head size.) It shades her eyes from the sun, which is perfect when we go for walks in the stroller, but it doesn't shade her entire face from sunlight. The back flap doesn't bother her or get in her way, and the color (lavender) looks nice on her.",5
21586,Not too big but definitely has room to grow into it. It completely covers te top of head ears and neck so no worry that those sensitive spots will get burnt. It ties under the chin and has a toggle behind the back of head to snug up the cap so baby can't pull it off,5
293566,I ordered these and they are absolutely gorgeous!  Ordered a small/medium.  Great color and the fit was slightly larger but I still wore them and they are absolutely sexy and comfortable.  I will order be ordering several other pair but I will have to go down in size to a small.  Great purchase!,5
384776,I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this bag!! It's very thick and sturdy.. obviously authentic.. and you can't really tell from the photos online but the bag is shaped like a suitcase and sits up on its own.. it also has a long shoulder strap inside that is attachable (or detachable) and the size is so very convenient..,5
148239,It is a beautiful ring and I got as my wedding ring is showing considerable wear and this ring is made of extremely hard. But the best part is the comfort fit. It's rounded on the edges of the inside which makes it comfortable to wear. I would definitely recommend this ring to others.,5
823025,"I gave it four stars, ONLY because it was to big for me. I returned it to order a smaller size.
I got a Large, based on reviews and the size chart. I am 5' 10"" tall, 140 lbs (somedays 135) 36 c/d depending, and wear a size 6-7 in missme jeans, it was kinda huge for rash guard swim wear, if you want a jacket type thing great, but not for water. In water it should be snug. So, I returned it for a medium.
Oh, and the white, which I ordered, is see through, so plan accordingly.",4
671240,Absolutely worst order I've ever had. I will NEVER order anything from China again. It came 6days late and it seemed to be made for a 4yo even though i ordered a XXL (i usually wear L/XL.) i was extremely disappointed. It was completely see thru and the slip was practically a shirt by itself.,1
56879,"I ordered the Priscilla Pink case and I do really love how nicely made it is. However, a big deciding factor on which one to get was the yellow flower on the back. Pink and yellow are my two favorite colors and I'm disappointed mine didn't have the yellow flower. Still very nice and will serve its purpose. Perfect for my upcoming trip and for college this year. 4/5 stars because there's no yellow on mine",4
736619,"I'm a 36C/34D, bought  the medium and regretted not getting the large. I managed to fit on the last hook setting, but I'll have to stretch it out a bit before wearing it again. It does get me nearly flat which is great and isn't tight around my ribs like my old sports bra. I can breathe just fine, but I will definitely not be wearing this for strenuous activities and will bring something else to change out of this when cosplaying.",4
195318,"Not what I expected and definitely not worth $15.45.
The charms are small compared to similar styles, I'm lucky the person I bought it for has a very small wrist or they would look tiny. The length of the bracelet is fine, it just the size of the charms themselves. The clasps do not close well so I have to replace them or the bracelet will probably fall off. I personally have (and have seen) similar style bracelets of much better quality for half the price.",1
36905,"This is large, but has the ability to hold many pairs of earrings. Even the longer earrings can be stored by cutting out the third and fifth rows. I purchased this as a birthday gift for my grand daughter. It is not top heavy and is very strong. I am sure she will get a lifetime of use from this. It is very well made.",5
163423,"Ordered a mens medium for my son, fits a tad large but thats way easier to fix than a shirt thats too small.  The colors are quite vibrant, think fresh new york knicks jersey blue and orange.  It will fit and look a bit better after a few washes.",5
759706,"A note in the order form mentioned that the coat ran small and to order a size larger than you normally would, so I did.  The coat came and was ridiculously small!  A person 3 sizes smaller than me tried it on and it fit her. Needless to say I'll be returning it.",1
777128,"Adorable and fits perfect over my large bust! Love the design, colors and the chevron! Looks pretty on and really comfortable! I love to wear it with a short or cropped sweater and a slip because the fabric is see through in the light! Love the length and the flow! I got this at a discount for a honest review!!",5
384955,"Great little bag! The material seems sturdy and it can fit more than it seems. It is definitely small, would not be suitable for a school backpack, but i wanted something small to replace my purse so this is perfect. And the free puff ball key chain inside is super cute!",5
377128,"I am 5' 10"" with a 28-29 inch waist.  Based off the reviews I went ahead and ordered an xl to be safe. It fit me great.  It is a thinner material but I didn't find it to be see through.  It wasn't floor length which I expected, it came to my ankles and looked like a high low styled skirt - and I was hoping for that. I paired it with a white crop shirt and brown heels.  Worked perfectly for while I was in Mexico, can't wait to wear it more often this summer!",5
429722,"It's very pretty and fits just a little big.  That said, my wife is very tiny and it's exceptionally difficult to find dresses that fit.  Even xxs on this site tends to run a bit big for her.  The elastic waist disguises the fit pretty well and I just had to add a few small holes to the belt.  Which is common so I have a tool to make them look right.",4
351208,"I don't know why these have so many bad reviews. I was searching everywhere for replacement tops & was skeptical on purchasing these because of all the bad reviews but I absolutely love these!! Mines is secure, it did't fall out or anything yet & they are so cute & cheap! Will be buying again",5
417228,"Looks nice but only works for five months.  Belocia has not responded to my request to repair or replace the winder.  I must manually start the winder but pressing the power button each time I want it to rotate.  It works for that cycle only.  Instead of 900 TPD, I might get 50.  Spend the extra money on a Wolf.",1
129748,"I love this elegant looking creative blouse.  The material is stretchy but feels more like cotton to me.  The mesh around the neck is very soft and not itchy at all.  This is a very, very comfortable blouse.  I've worn it to work and I love not having to worry about cleavage or constantly adjusting it.  I plan to buy more blouses from this company.",5
52756,My newborn is outside allot and has a tiny head. We have tried multiple newborn hats and they are all way too big. This is the only hat thay fits her little head. The only downfall is that I wish it was velcro or something easier than a tie under the chin,4
875998,The dress itself fit well but the cap sleeves were a bit problematic for my large arms.  I loved the dress and I made it work.  It is definitely work the money spent.  I used this dress for a photo shoot.  It came across on camera perfectly.,5
65176,"No wonder why you get sooo many for super cheap. Most of my tongue rings have always lasted me until I wanted a new one. With these, I am so far on my 4th. Out of 3, not one of them has lasted me longer than 1-2 weeks. Balls literally just break apart in your mouth for no reason at all. Be careful!!!",1
852283,I ordered this bathing suit  and paid extra for two day shipping.  I usually wear a 2X but the review says order one size bigger because it runs small so I ordered a 4 x which was not even like an extra-large more like a  juniors size medium do not order because you will be disappointed with the sizing. I'm so disappointed because I had a trip planned this weekend.,1
599927,"Fit is way off. Much, much, much smaller than what it is suppose to be.  I ordered a size up and it was still too small. I gave it to my mother who is 2 sizes smaller than me and it was still to small for her. I ended up giving it to Goodwill. Not worth the money or the hassle.",1
439660,"Super cute...fits a touch tight but overall the medium was perfect for my 5'3"" frame....i weigh 135. I read reviews about the looser area in the stomach being a bit unflattering if you are heavier but if you keep it pulled down its not a bother. The fabric is a blend of cotton and spandex or polyester...uper stretching and because there is polyester it won't fade after washing for quite some time. Super stylish and i would buy another in an alternate color. Highly recommend.",5
36667,"I purchased this umbrella as a gift for my daughter whose only transportation in Pittsburgh is the bus system or walking.  She absolutely loves it since the wind does not blow it open, she can see through it clearly, even when she pulls it down low, and it keeps her dry.  The construction is very sturdy.  I bought a second one because she liked it so much....but accidentally left it on a bus! :-)",5
291437,"Excuse my face in my picture I sent it to a guy and was happy I got it. I ordered it in a small bc I read the reviews. The small fit perfectly, I'm slim thick so yeah lol. With the yellow it's a little see-thru but other then that I love it. I'm chocolate so I love color. I ordered it Sept 17 and got it on Oct 13, which I knew already by reading before buying.",4
505697,"Second time buying from here.
Very happy on both accounts.
They are sized a bit small.
Knowing this both times I have ordered a few sizes larger. Follow the sizing chart.
Colors are bright and mostly as pictured. Navy blue was more like an LA Dogers blue. Bright red was just as picteted.  Top quality products none the less. I will buy again :) fast shipping.",5
516461,"I have worn this gorgeous belt so many times already! I most recently wore it to my work Christmas Party and it looked amazing! I purchased a beautiful maroon lace top with ruffled sleeves at my wrists with a black pair of pants. I felt like the outfit needed just a little something else to really jazz it up and this belt was absolutely perfect! Every time I wear it, I get compliments. It is very classy, has a great weight to it and the gold color is very soft and shiny. It was an awesome find!",5
72494,"Bracelet arrived quickly. I am a large man and was afraid my wrist would be too big. Description says 8.5 inches. It probably is, and it just fits my wrist. The magnet is strong. I've been wearing it for 5 days and it has not let loose even once. I live the fact that it is rubber -- so I can wear it 24/7 - in the shower, swimming, running. It looks like leather. I love it.",5
41014,"They look cute, but way too tight unless you have chicken legs! I am 5'3"" 150 with thick legs and even though I tried to pull them all the way, they rolled and looked very unflattering. I ended up folding them over at my knees but it was still tight. Waste of money.",1
85444,"I was so worried reading other reviews but this shirt is adorable. It arrived much faster than stated and looks great with any look. I have since ordered again, hoping I love the next shirt as much! I ordered a large and am 5/7 150lbs and it fits really well.",4
111214,"I love the style and the feel (after a good softening) but SO SO SO many of the stitches came out on the first wash; especially stitches in the belt.  For the price of $25 though I can't be too shocked.  If you're desperate for a very heavy, very warm, and also hooded robe then go ahead and get it... but if you can afford better and aren't desperate, then buy better.",2
800326,"It's definitely a gorgeous top, a fantastic alternative to the usual mundane tank top or halter. It's modest, yet it shows off the shoulders and underarms very well. The lace which goes over each shoulder is lovely as well, and its soft texture definitely makes this top worth its price and worth wearing. If anything were to ever happen to it, I'd definitely purchase another one.",5
377934,"I love this top. It is very light weight a good summer look. The colors are soft, it looks very nice with jeans. The top fits as expected. It did take a very long time to get to me but it was sent in the time told to me with my order.",5
780233,"This tie is fine.  The length is good and the color of the blue stripe is good.  However, the cranberry stripe looks faded out from certain angles.  Straight on it is a nice cranberry color, like in the photo, but from other angles it looks much lighter.  That might be what they mean by ""metallic cranberry.""  If you don't mind the color change, this should work well for you.  I'll keep it, but I likely won't wear it often.",3
449351,I really considered this shirt a few times not to sure if I loved it or not well I love it on! I bought this shirt because I am pregnant and can't stand the idea of buying wear once maternity clothes. I love it this shirt it's perfect for this summer and next when I am back to my pre pregnancy weight! Also I was told I would get my order until May 31st - June 11th and I received my order May 6th. AWESOME!,5

815426,I have shorter legs about a 29 inseam I really don't see these working for 32 to 34 but they worked so good for me at the wedding I went to. My shirt was a little short and these kept it all in place.  Thankful I found these gems.,5
474014,"To be fair, I paid $3.20 with no shipping fee. If you were looking to buy a scarf for a child, I would totally recommend it. The cat print is so cute and the scarf is soft, not I doubt it's durable or washable. The scarf is mailed from China so it took me about a month to get it.",3
557288,"Rubbed this into my Ariat work boots. I've been out in the rain for a week and it seems to work just fine. Rubbed this into my personal everyday boots as well just to keep them conditioned and protected. They will make your boots a shade darker, even after absorption.

My only concern is the fact that certain types of silicone are known to break down the protein in leather, causing your boots to wear out more quickly. I don't know if this is the case with Rocky brand. Some clarification would be nice.",4
754661,"the lense was almost correct but the thickness was off, too thin, and the fit was also off.  there was no real connection with the frame.

63247,This costume was great with all the parts that came with it! The wrist guards were really big & the bodice of the dress was pretty big as well.

331865,"I love this belt. I read the other reviews, but my belt has been fine so far. Right size and buckle works great. Had it a month so far and have been happy. I am thinking about buying the white one now. Price was good too. Has not been easy finding a belt that looks like this. So far so good.",5
644454,"This item does not fit as advertised. Not even close. I normally wear a XL but up sized to a XXL because it says it runs small. That is an understatement to say the least. I couldn't even get this on. Now the seller is giving me a bit of a hard time with the return. They want more details as to why I want to return this item. Unbelievable
  Will never buy anything from Ayliss again",1
881013,I like the dress but ordered a larger size based on reviews and that was a mistake. There was way too much room in the hips and I have good size hips. I need a large for my size 10-12. The slit in the back is not high so now sure about other review.,3

Will probably buy another ",5

I'm 155 lbs at 5'7"" with an athletic build and the medium was too small for me.  The prints are fun and bright, and I wish they would have fit.

He's been buying those really cheap ones with the plastic clasps. {That just break after a few days/weeks uses.} Since he's had this one he's had no trouble at all!

The only problem I have run accross with these particular ones (I have tons of Iron Fist Shoes)is that the studs on the top of the heel fall of too easy. I have only had these for a short period of time and several studs have fallen off and doesn't look too great. Cheaply made, but if you can fix it, fake it to make it.",4

It looks decent and clean. and seems sturdy.  just not the right thing for me.
I was refunded instantly upon returning so.. credit for that.",3

Nope it was way too tight on my 4 year old luckily I have a younger daughter who is almost 2 well it fits her sort of it's still kind of small so I don't see it fitting her for long.

599078,"I am comfortable in this swimsuit, but it definitely runs a little small. I'm 5'3"" and 125 lbs, and the medium barely fits me. Also, the padding is minimal. Your nipples can sometimes be noticed through it. However, if you're just going out on the boat/beach with friends, its still a cute swimsuit.",3
409072,"I bought this ring for my husband recently, and while it was a little bit too tight, he LOVES it. Wears it to bed, showering, and even at work sometimes. The ring holds up nicely, and not to mention is beautiful! Will update my review should anything happen (stones fall out, scratches, etc.)",5

318211,"It isn't like the pictures at all! I normally wear M/L depending on the cut. I went with a large just to make sure it fits on the larger side. There is no tag on it to know if I even got the right size. It is too small and the length comes to about the hips. It isn't long at all. I'm only 5' 5"" and it is still only sitting on my hips. It is cheap looking however, I wasn't expecting super high quality based on the price which I was ok with. I wouldn't recommend.",1
467174,"I got the watch quickly, the watch is NOT leather, it's cheap plastic. The band was scratched and there was protectant on the watch face. And the color is way off, it almost looks black but is dark gray. It's too much of a hassle to return so oh well.",2
611321,"Slip off very easily. I ordered the wrong size first and thought the correct size would help, but it didn't. I had bought some similar to these at Target and thought they'd fit the same, but they don't. This is a cheaper version so I guess you get what you pay for.",2
417347,"Love these earrings. I purchased these to replace a lost earring in a pair I'd purchased a couple of years ago. I wear them almost every day and had a hard time finding these. Perfect. The charm is very light weight, and just the right size. I like having a little bit of a ""dangle"" that's not too overwhelming for work or play. Not a big French wire fan, so I replaced the wires with the Euroclasp.",5
494565,great lightweight breathable comfy shirt which is what i was looking for. Bought the Tom Waits and the Hunter S. Thompson too rare to live too rare too die shirt also. Design was top notch 100% legit seller. Will def buy from again. Shipping was prompt even considering a July 4th holiday. I think i see a Bukowski shirt in my future from your site. appreciate it!,5
882677,Loved this bag- did the Disney Marathon some years ago and did not know that Dooney & Bourke did this bags.  Was very happy to find it and the quality and size are prefect!  I have never received so many compliments on any bag I have carried before.,5

771166,"My daughter and I love this dress! It's very modest and elegant. My daughter is 9yrs,  5ft tall, 96 lbs. We ordered the size 14 and the dress stopped at her feet. This was perfect for us. The quality of the material is just as good if not better than the numerous dresses that I bought her from Dillards. It has enough layering so that it is not see through and it's sightly heavy. The detail in the neckline is: very pretty, bigger and bolder than I thought it would be; and it sparkles/shines.",5
231040,"Nice additional room in the right place for a guy but not much else to talk about. About the same price as TJ mens underwear but not really close in quality. Fabric really thin and no reinforcement anywhere. Almost like wearing nothing but costs a whole lot more!  Not a disaster, but I won't buy again.",3
13776,"I routinely purchase these shoe inserts as they wear out.  My feet do not hurt, but after a long day of walking around and stuff they feel wore out.  Since using these my feet have never felt wore out.  When I first started wearing them my felt like they were now on pillows.  Whatever these inserts have done corrected something in how I walk.  I don't plan to stop using them anytime soon.",5
364978,"Really enjoyed the comfort of these. Once they are on, you almost never know they are there. I appreciated the silicone grip to keep socks from slipping and I appreciate the customer service support they provided by simply checking on their product that had no issues. I will order again when needed. Great comfort and great experience.",5
188740,"Nice except it only comes with one kind of plastic tie (unlike the ""other"" one available on Amazon (Singer) with a variety for more flexibility), and the ties ""stick"" in the chamber so you may waste one or two every time you switch colors (black and ""clear""). It seems to pierce fabric a little better than the Singer model, but if so only a little and it may just be that there's more to hold on to with a larger trigger. It will take the Singer ties in case you have some left over.",4
2706,"I'm an average height/build (5'7"" 145-150... Not super thin/not chunky).... Leg Ave hose are made for skinny girls, always have been lol. I generally try to find their plus size. These fit fine around the waist and legs (not tight, didn't create a muffin top) but they fell a couple inches short and I had to keep tugging them up so I didn't start feeling like a penguin.

Since they're opaque tights, I was able to pull on them fairly strongly (w nails) and they didn't puncture or run so that's a plus, especially for $5!",4
653394,The size fit perfectly for me (I'm usually a medium or large depending on the style and hat). The quality is good and it is super cute! I was able to wear it to a concert and it didn't get too hot wearing it either! Shipped in early and the package was handled well.,5
633025,They arrived as promised. They are half the weight of our old ones and easy to pack with large pockets on the front which makes organizing easy. I would have given them 5 stars but on our first trip with this set the seams on the middle case pulled apart.,3
766108,"Only ONE of the shirts fit way too small...the grey one.  The other 3 shirts fit perfectly!  So I found that strange that one of them didn't fit right.  I didn't think I could return it because I purchased them as a set.  In any case, nice shirts.",5
552742,"This was a lovely cape. The fabric is a heavy wool and  the color and style is very chic; however, the sizing is so far off that the XL would fit about a 10 year old child!!  The return policy was so complicated, I did not return it even though it was rather expensive.  I gave it away to a tiny friend.  Just beware,,buyer, the sizes are WAY OFF.  Apparently the manufacturers do not understand that women in America are not tiny munchkins!!!
Very disappointed.",1
784706,Runs VERY small! I ordered a large and an extra large because of the reviews I read. I gave the large to my daughter who usually wears a size small and I've just lost 30 pounds so the XL is probably like a medium. I love the top though. Super cute!,3
663781,"This is a very cute necklace! It arrived on time packaged well, I think it's a great buy for the price. It looks great on not too heavy, doesn't scratch the neck at all. Purchase it if you would enjoy a cute necklace for a great price it won't disappoint you.",5
831804,"I ordered this dress because it looked elegant. However it's cheap material, there's material overlapping the front where the metal is at the top of the dress making it look two toned and two layers with a crazy line across. Maybe removing that extra material on the top inside of the dress will make it look better...
It's horrible.
I tried it on even though the material is cheap with hopes that the fit would make it better... but it didn't.  Shame on anyone for saying the material is good... Not True At All! Cheap!!",1
133620,"Great shoes - was looking for something to replace my barefeet so I can wear orthotics while kickboxing. These are light weight, hug my feet comfortably and have a thinner upper so I can still feel the bag when I kick AND they have good lateral stability. My feet are on the narrow side so it's hard to find shoes that are snug enough. These are perfect. Oh, and they are really cute too.",5
600909,"Belts have always been one of those things that are adequate for the purpose but irritating in some details. My weight and waist dimensions change daily, and my belts seem to be too tight or too loose. The EazyBelt eliminates this nagging problem in that it lets me instantly make adjustments.",5

Cream satin background with black lace cover and rhinestone bow clasp. Perfect for your cell phone I7 plus bare essentials you'll need, i.e. makeup, keys, cash.",5
497630,The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because we haven't had it a month and maybe used it three times and the remote plug in decided to quit working. I can still plug the manual in and go through the colors but it's a hassle since you are zipping through fur. Other than that we loved it.,2
461957,"Yeah I like it. It just doesn't seem like these designers have learned that women have curves on the side. It's just straight down  on the sides with no flare which makes you look hip fat, when it's just the design.

Tip: Tuck it in, leave the last few buttons unbuttoned and throw a light sweater over it for the peter pan look.",4
334967,"Got these as a Christmas gift for my teenage daughter.  She loves them and has already worn them. She wears a 7 and says they fit true to size. I wear a 6 and also tried them on which they were a little big on me, so I would say order your normal dress shoe size.  They look great and are of good quality.",5
39850,I feel like this would be a good bra if the sizes were right.  I ordered the 34DD (as I usually wear a 32DD or 34D depending on brand).  It was so tight I could not do up the back and it was very awkward. I don't know how people get this on!  It is a shame as the front seemed good and nice and modest cut.,3

80708,"Bought this for my boyfriend as kind of a funny gift since he loves pugs. He normally wears an x-large to xx-large so played it safe and bought the larger size since he rather have his shirts fit loose than tight, fits him perfectly. It does seem to be a bit longer than most shirts but he loved it and thought it was funny. Material felt decent, not as soft and nice as some of his other shirts but still better than most. Haven't washed it yet so not sure on shrinkage, etc.",4

He absolutely LOVES this helmet!
The price we bought it for, could not even be beat on EBay!
It completed his astronaut costume perfectly and now he feels like he is on ""real"" missions.
Highly recommend this product. Be careful not to let it hit the floor too much - it seems as though it could break if handeled TOO roughly.

Perfect for both boys and girls.",5

That's okay because I put it in  one of the bigger pockets.  I would definitely buy this purse again.  It is also just the right size for me.

The zippers are metallic but feel really cheap and so does the buttons and how are put on the jacket.. It doesn't have as much faux fur as it looks it has on the picture and the jacket it's not that thick.,3

I thought they would be nearly impossible for her to take off or them to fall out.  Within one day, the one back fell off and it was lost.  I guess I was wrong.  They were a waste for us.",2

Straps are strong. Good for clothing. if you need more protection i wouldn't suggest it. When you check your luggage you need to put the shoulder strap to the side zipper or it will be lost. Overall i give 5 stars.,5
807574,This dress is beautiful but it came with a tear in the skirt and a open seam. The tear was more of a gaping hole so it is irreparable and that is why I am giving it 2 stars. Had it not come damaged I would have given it 4 stars because it fits beautifully and looks fantastic.,2

I love that you can just lift up your pants to show them off without taking off your shoes, although  you can show off their cool belts when you take off your shoes. SOO CUTE. I also have superhero earrings so they can match. Love it! They are soft and comfortable, too!",5
482342,"These have been great! I decided to get socks for my Vibrams to try to keep the odor down, and I found myself wearing these casually as well. I like where the socks cut off, and I wouldn't call them ""no show."" These would be a crew cut sock in my book. These have held up to a lot of abuse, and I would definitely buy more should the need arise.",5
101857,I really like the adjust-ability of this hat from a chin strap perspective and head circumference way. I deducted a start because the brim is to floppy and my son didn't like that. It's great for parents with a baby that likes to take off their hat - stays on really well.,4
312824,"Best casual shoe ever! Lightweight, almost as comfortable as a running shoe, fashion, great feel. The only thing, I bought eleven and it fits as 11 with dressing socks. I am not sure if that should be like that, but if I put a regular sock it is too tight.",5

I am not a big jewelry wearer.",4
542292,"Those who question the math may be missing a critical part here. Notice the v following the m indicating a product of mass times velocity. Velocity carries the vector component and so the product of the assumed scalar mass times the vector velocity is a vector. Similar with the change over time, if you assume the mass doesn't change over time, the product of mass times velocity implies the velocity changes. Although in real life I find that my mass most certainly does change over time, not always in the way I prefer.",4

They were just what I was looking for and seem to be well made with sturdy materials, (China). The microfiber is machine embroidered and is quite feminine. They are very comfortable and now I have nine.",5

Dont want to squish those tata's!! The size I got was great and they are nice and snug in place. As it should be lol Since I did so, I can review that they are great! Gave 4 stars because they do run super small. But if you get lucky, you will love them",4

I am typically a small so I ordered Medium and it fit well.  The shirt I received is still a little high waisted though, so I think if you ordered true to your usual size you would get a very tight crop top.  Over all satisfied with my purchase.",4
649265,I gave 2 stars because at least it was shipped on time. However the quality of this swimsuit is not what I expected. It's not lined and so thin it's almost see through the top was horrible. the bottoms fit ok. The image shown compared to what I got is a joke.,2
598957,"This fit pretty well - but it was VERY long on me. Be careful based on your height while ordering! Also, although it may look extremely elegant on the model, be prepared for the material to look a little more cheap than it is. Overall, it is a great dress to wear to an event, and it can be wrapped in so many ways that it can turn into about 7 or 8 dresses!",4
185110,"It favors the picture but Im a 6 and after reading the reviews I ordered a large thinking its better to get it too big and have to alter than too small. Well, It still fit tooo snug to wear to church or work so this will have to be a date dress. I should've gotten an ex large.",3

Watch seems to work well, keeping correct time. However, the actual crown in the center which moves as the seconds pass, is so large you can hardly see the watches hands. Not what the photos on line show at all, and absolutely not what a child who is learning to tell time needs. Very disappointed!",2

It's tall enough to give a traditional look, but not so tall as to be awkward-looking. The velour is very thin and barely fuzzy at all. It is a matte color and not ""shiny"" at all.  The color is a true red and as pictured.",5

The only thing I'll warn about is that it fits slightly on the small side.  I got a Large which says waist 36-38.  But those numbers refer to ""real measurements"" rather than pant size.  For reference, I wear size 35 waist in jeans and the pants in this costume just fit.

Enjoy.  I would definitely buy another costume from this company again.",5

I was expecting an actual rubber sole, while it's just an extra layer of padding and some clear rubbery material (resembling hot glue) in the shape of the word ""Snoozies!"" over and over again over the fabric (so mostly fabric contacting the ground).",4
646987,The charm is ok. A little smaller than my other pandora charms and it does not say pandora around the hole as pictured. Did no come in a pandora box instead a flimsy plain unassembled box was included. The charm was in tissue. Probably not authentic. Recommend you buy your pandora charms at your local jeweler not online.,2
97316,I was hoping that the shirt would fit as a 10 would have but I guess I should have gotten a size smaller...around the neck area is big so I'm thinking I can probably wear as an off the shoulder style...not really impressed with it but the color and material is quite comfortable...I'm thinking maybe I can alter the shirt somehow to fit...,3
59913,"Wonderful!  If relaxing to you means tracing your steps around the house while trying to track down all of the grips on the bottom of these socks that have peeled off, while constantly cleaning up the trail of fuzz left behind from the poor quality sock material, then these are for you!  Left behind half a sock worth of fuzz-- black socks on white carpet, conveniently.  Did not bother trying the other pair of pink socks although the fuzz could compliment the black and make for a confetti look? Loads of clean-up FUN!",1
846414,"Do not waste your money! I received this skirt and laughed...someone out there must have taken a screenshot of the skirt and super imposed the image onto cheap fabric. You can't tell what the images are supposed to be (flowers?)...more like fuzzy blobs of various colors! The fabric feels like an inexpensive Halloween costume from Walmart, and the stitches are visibly horrible! If you can find a link for the REAL skirt in this image, please let me know, I'd be happy to order the REAL one!",1
148445,"I like this hat, but it has the same problem all big straw hats seem to have. It is fragile. I broke the brim by holding it at the edge. I have had this problem with most oversized straw hats. It still kept the sun off my face and neck and was cool when there was a breeze.",4
845765,"Great run around town tote when you don't want to carry a bulky purse! love the rolled handles too, a must for any purse in my opinion. Enough room to throw in your wallet, phone and any other daily necessities. PU leather is not a deal breaker, great little tote.  Zipper closer and small zipper
compartment inside.",4
720055,The dress is just 2 pieces of fabric sewn together.  I usually buy a large but got an XL because i wanted it to be bigger .  It would not fit my medium size sister.  It is very sheer no lining.  If I could figure out how I would send it back.  I would not purchase from this company again. It made me give a star rating but I would not even give one star.,1
819893,"The color was just like the picture! i loved it, it was long and i cut it down! I would tell people to buy this. It came in a nice plastic bag! I am 160 and I got a size med, I am going to check the size.

I used this for my 30th birthday pictures",5

But, if you are tall and skinny, these will fit like a dream. I have very long legs and they're the right length. If you have short legs, they'll probably be too long. My hips are 39"" and waist is 35"". You can see from the pictures, those stars are crying from the stretch haha. Be tall, be skinny, and you'll be fine. ;)",5
609401,"The lining fabric feels terribly cheap against your skin, and the gold colored neck strap feels like children's costume jewelry.  From a distance, however, the dress looks pretty good. I wore it once and the whole time I was worried someone would look closely at the dress and realize how poor the quality is.

The reason the dress gets any stars at all is because it fit comfortably,  was pretty figure flattering, and the length was PERFECT (I'm 5'8 and the dress rested on the tops of my feet).",3
77378,"Love the rubber material that looks like leather.  I can't wear leather, the perspiration would take it out in a month. My wife does not care for it. It's a men & bracelet thing. The clasp does stick once in a while but not enough to make it bothersome.",5
542832,This product did not really work out well for me.  It is one of those that is good in concept but not in reality.  As long as you stand just like the model does all day and not move you're good otherwise it's just not going to work.  It just isn't...don't doubt me!,1
399833,"I thought the bracelet was very nice.  It arrived before it was expected to, which was a bonus.  The only thing that I didn't like about it was that the picture was a little mis-leading.  I thought that the links between the hearts had diamonds all along the band, not just a little one in the middle.",4
821552,"This is perfection. Its lightweight and seems sturdy enough, its good looking and the handle strap is crazy long. I need my bags to hang low on my hip and this was does go long and with some extra strap to spare. The pockets are great and useful with their varying shapes and sizes and it just works.",5
306804,"The outfit was super cute on my 7 month old!  He received lots of compliments.  My only issue with the outfit was the snaps in the diaper area.  At one point we just left them open because they kept unsnapping even with a fresh, dry diaper.  Otherwise, it was cute but it will likely be a one time use outfit.",4
111446,It is absolutely beautiful.  It came in a box with a small bag so that it could be given as a gift very easily.  I've had it for about two weeks and don't want to take it off. I've noticed a shift in my energy but it is difficult to say if it is the orgone as I am doing many other things as well -  but no matter - it is a beautiful piece of jewelry and well made.  I definitely recommend. Peace.,5
193810,I purchased the medium for my eleven year old daughter (about 5') who needed a black skirt for her Orchestra performance. It fit perfectly and the bottom hit at the ankle. It is a flat skirt with no pleating and very little flare. It looked nice paired with the white blouse she wore. My daughter said it was soft and comfortable to wear for the whole performance.,4
208736,"I was very pleased with the product! Had a little trouble with getting my shipping address to work for them, but the product arrived a day earlier than stated and they shipped it the same day just as they promised!

I wore these in 90 degrees weather and they are outstanding. I have very thick thighs so rubbing/chaffing has been an issue, well no longer",5
177778,"i did not get  a discount to review this product, its nice, it i really cute on fits well i am 5 2 170 and ordered a xl. very very cute, everyone loved it , it fits well, the colors are pretty, the only complaint i have is sew in the boob covers they put in, they put in round circles that fold over when washed so hand wash if possible. but for the money the suit is worth alot more,",5
619913,"I am so THRILLED about this dress!  The fabric is beautiful and delicate, and it fits nicely (I am 5'0"", 105 lbs, with a small-ish waist).  I am even tempted to get one in every color (I wish).  It got here in a reasonable amount of time.  The only negative thing I have to say about it is that it had a mildew-y scent when it got here, but a quick wash can fix that.  :)  Very happy with this purchase and would get it again!",5
721494,"eI was desperate for a small purse which would hold all my stuff. I checked every purse on the Amazon network and finally came up with this one. It was a good choice and is much more roomy than it looks - I plan to get
another one in black for the winter. A GOOD buy !!!",5
764875,"This is a great bikini top for a large chest. I have struggled to find halter tops with underwire for a DDD cup but this top has a layer underneath that hides the underwire.

45002,"I love the design, the material, the color and the fact that this bag is what you would expect; most notably, not pretentious but you still feel lux when rockin' this bag.  It's the perfect size for work files, magazines, water bottle and the most basic personal items (phones, wallets, keys, gloves, etc...AND it fits perfectly in my bike basket.  Sure it could have more pockets or organizing amenities but i prefer simple design.",5

The result... my gift arrived late, she never knew who had sent it, it was not wrappped, and had a price tag NICELY attached...",2

Gloria",5
208587,The arrived promptly and my granddaughter absolutely loves it.  My only problem is the ball on the bottom of each strap keeps coming undone and I have to sew it back on.  We have had Flipeez before and never had this problem.  So not sure if this one is just a lemon.  This wouldn't stop me from buying again though.,3

Unfortunately my battery packs that I replaced it with, the cords are too short and the battery packs cannot be put in the pocket. To be fair I did not call contact the seller. It is just such a hassle. If it worked right, it would be awesome.",1

I'm almost embarrassed to say how many pairs of gloves we lose in a year.  I've already gone back and bought four more pairs! I did receive a small discount for testing and leaving unbiased and honest review.,5

We tried other more expensive brands but he won't wear them because they didn't feel as good and the v-neck was deeper and looked sloppier. Learned my lesson- only buy Calvin Klein.",5
590482,"My 4 year old loves it. It is a bit too big for him, but give it a few months it would fit nicely.
Costume design and materials are good. Simple yet detailed enough to effectively portray Commander Cody.

One area for improvement would be the helmet as the combination of eye slit size and the material it is made of makes it difficult to see.",4
708939,"The first one was 4 sizes too small. I am a size 6 but reordered a 10. Good thing prize is not bad and shipping was free. Size 10 fits great though, so size 6 will be a gift to a friend. Not a total loss but hope others can learn from my review.",4
672154,"I bought this for heavy school use, and the space/design is pretty good for the price. You can fit a laptop and a couple books easily. The material it's made of, however, is really cottony and stains easily. I was wearing jeans when this backpack was brand new and they dyed all the right side of my backpack blue. HOWEVER, I was under really heavy rain with this backpack for at least 10 minutes with no umbrella and NOTHING was wet when I got home! That was really impressive.",4
95469,Cute watch and Lego's are always cool. The only thing I don't like is the minute numbers around the outside of the watch face count up to 30 then count down instead of counting up to 59. It seems to confuse my daughter so when I ask her what time it is and its 8:45 she responds with 8:15. My other daughter got a batman time teacher where the minutes continue counting up around the face and it causes much less confusion.,4
585750,"Nice bag, though a tad smaller than I expected (was still able to squeeze in a lot of items). Side pockets are a bit of a joke (very difficult to get much to fit into the pockets - my toothbrush holder won't even fit). Would be SO much better if the pockets (inside main compartment and side pockets) had elastic..... it's quite difficult to fit much in the pockets inside (even with travel sized bottles). FYI: the hook is VERY small.",4
122459,"This delivered right on time. The packaging was really nice, bubble wrapped and with a separate black pouch for storage. It's a little shorter than I would like, but if you clamp it on the last hole it adds length (picture shows the longest length). Overall it's a good deal for the price.",4

Can't wait till I get he watch.

313310,"Even if it had fit properly (it was Asian sizing, not mentioned in the description anywhere) the material was not very good quality, and there were several loose thread ends hanging. Overall, it looked to be poorly made with very cheap material. There was also a very strange, NOT pleasant, smell that had permeated the bag as well as the clothing. Will not be shopping this brand again.",2
148950,"This is such a beautiful nightgown. the design is gorgeous and the functionality of it is perfect just after you have a baby.

I brought this with me to the hospital when my second was born, this is basically all I wore. It was so comfortable and it made me feel pretty in a time that I otherwise would not have felt pretty (lets be honest who out there actually likes the way their body looks after having a baby?)",5
45957,"I anticipated some sort of poor fit, whether it be too revealing up top, too baggy around the body, or what have you. I was shocked to discover the outfit fits me like a glove. Obviously, this won't be true for all, but at 5'8"" and slim build, the suit looks incredible. The material is fine quality, and it looks really cool and really sexy. Highly recommended.",5
330018,"Not happy with quality.  The attached heart chain fell off while my daughter was wearing it and is lost so because of that, I don't believe I can return it since part of it is missing.  The part that you twist off to attach the charms consistently comes undone.  The charm that we purchased to have on it is a specialized photo charm of my father in law who just passed away in Sept and my daughter and because I am so afraid of that falling off, we don't allow her to wear the bracelet.",2
659230,"I so wanted this dress to be cute It was awful. Like really bad. I'm 5 feet tall and busty but this dress hung on me like a sack. And it was SUPER long. It was almost passed my knees! I think it would be perfect on someone tall, thin and with small boobs. But for me it was a dud. I will say though I liked the material a lot! It was very soft and it felt nice. But yeah I'm going to be returning this.",1
466273,the picture needs to reveal dress as it is.  it shows there is a small black piece of material at the bust line well there is not.  Also if you have large bust there is no way a large is going to accomidate them.  I sent the dress back.  The material is beautiful as far as that goes i liked it but there is no way i could wear it.,2

After a year of wear, its kept it's shine and is not scratched at all. It looks like a white gold ring but is very light and strong. The only down side is that this ring will not bend or break, so if you mess up your ring finger then you will have to go to the emergency room to get this ring removed. For the price, this ring is amazing!",5
128737,"I couldn't be happier with this jacket! Based on the reviews, I went a size up and ordered a medium. I'm 5'4, 125lbs and normally fit in a small but the medium fits perfectly! I think the small would have fit just fine if I wasn't planning on wearing anything but a tshirt underneath. The quality is what I've come to know and love from Columbia and I would absolutely recommend this jacket for anyone shopping around. Plus, you can't beat the price and free two day shipping with Prime.",5

I'm 5'7, 195 lbs, with a 36D bra size and the Large fit. I need to do more ab work for it to look amazing on but my boyfriend loves it. The top wrapped around enough to cover everything but when I raised my arms it slipped off; I think this will be fixed if I tie it tighter which may be hard because there was not much material left over. What I love most is I will be able to do different things with the top.",4
6119,"Love these pants. As I've noticed for all Carhartt products, they run small. I normally wear 34's, but in Carhartt 36 is the way to go. They are stiff while being broken in, but they get quite comfy after a few washes. The pockets are huge, in the most excellent way.",5
97789,the size I ordered was way underwhelming.. the color is more like a dark rust not the dark pink I was expecting.. and the pic makes it look like a tunic but fits just below the waist.. would not wear with leggings.. the sizing is so small im thinking about giving it to me 13 yr old daughter and I ordered an extra large.. on the positive. the material if very soft and medium weight.. not cheap feeling at all..,2

They are easy to get on; my toddler actually sits still while I put them on because it happens so quickly.  On that same note, she is able to take them off easier than some of her other shoes (like moccasins).  I think the sole on this is thicker than the soles on my Toms - nice and sturdy for my little monkey.",4

I walk about 800 meters from the parking lot to my desk, plus at least a mile during the day, and my feet feel great! No problems with blisters, either. If you're going sockless, there's some moisture, but not worth worrying over. No smells. I have received many compliments on the unique color.",5

736615,"Love the main fabric- the patches are horrible.  Very cheap looking,  one patch was sewn on the inside of the elbow rather than the outside.  Hem on sleeves was unraveled on receipt.  Still like the style,  just wish I didn't have to spend time fixing it.",3
183575,"Stud is a standard size, not too big and not too small. I personally like smaller studs. The length of the stem isn't to bad either but it is on the long side- I have to constantly move it/twist it so that the curly end isn't sticking out of my nose.
Overall a good ""backup"" stud to have, I will probably buy another one that I like more. Would recommend to a friend.",4

Can't seem to keep them for more than a few months, which is why I always get really cheap ones. I either break them or put them down and forget about them. I still have these and wear them all the time. They have scuffed a little on the lenses, but I am sure they are made of the cheapest materials possible, so what do you expect?",5

It did come with the slip which was great, but the hoop skirt broke and it made the dress much too long when I needed it the most. For the price it was good.

But it is so Very long for me....:-(((
The length is not so adjustable so I can not wear it (it will look awkward, and it is hard to hook and the tail will show at the side of my neck..)

Otherwise, if you are size M and up, I guess this works well.",3

(Granted, it's not fully smooth so don't expect that).  As someone with a larger cup size, it's hard to find push-up bras in my size and I'm SO excited to have found this bra!  Don't buy one-- buy like, 5!  You won't regret it-- I love it, and so does my boyfriend!  ;-)",5
28498,Purchased some for my wife and I and we both use them in all shoes as per the Orthopedic doctor advised for our activity level.  Have many sets and they are comfortable and hold up well. Price is par being PRIME and don't have to go to a doctors office to get them.,5
680756,"The product is great, fits nice and snug on my 10 yr old, In my earlier review, I gave it a 3 star rating because the package I got, had multiples of same color instead of 12 different colors. My daughter was a little disappointed with most of the dull beige and gray tanks in her. pack. I contacted the seller and I got replacement right away. I really appreciate the seller's response to my order.",5
254329,Pretty decent product besides how hard it is to get the sides retracted and one of them are a little wobbily/loose but I think I'll be able to fix it once it is opened. Everything else though is working and in pretty good condition. I would suggest fixing/doing something different with the side blades though to make it a little more user/kid friendly.,4
13063,I am happy that another customer that was reviewing another product mentioned these. They were exactly what I was looking for. These insoles fit perfectly in my work shoes. They are great for my heals and have great arch support. I stand and walk a lot at my job. It's been a week and my feet love them!,5
674839,"This dress was truly beautiful! The fabric is soft, modest length, and well made; however, I had to return the dress. I'm a size 22 but this dress was very tight in my waist. Everywhere else fit nicely. I would've tried to lose weight just so I could keep the dress but it comes with chest padding which is unnecessary for my size.",2
238493,I would've given this a 5 star if the little charm held it's design. The charm's paint got dirty easy and the design was removed as soon as i removed from my pocket when i first got it. It cuts well but leaves grooves on whatever you cut. But over all a good bandage scissor. I got it for a friend with another design and he liked it.,3
112288,I was a bit nervous buying this product with zero reviews but I am glad I did. I have been using these in my oakleys since September 2013 and I have had zero issues. These lenses are slightly thinner than Oakley lenses but that did not affect their fit in my frames. I have has zero scratches so far and the glasses have been dropped multiple times. The equivant Oakley name brand lenses would be $150 and I don't see any differences that justifies oakleys prices. If I ever destroy these I will buy another set again.,5
381808,"We used to use the long sleeve bib from Ikea as an art smock for my daughter but recently discovered it is now too small. This one is great! Thicker than the Ikea one, similar feeling to a cloth diaper cover. I've washed it by hand once and in the washing machine once and held up great. Oh and my daughter is 3 (short and 36 pounds) and it fits her great.",5
228267,"I normally wear a small. Followed the advise in the comments and ordered a Large, Large fits perfectly.  This design is a quick and easy way to be a little dressed up which I love b/c I'm not a big fan of jewelry.  The ""buttons"" that make up the center of the flowers are not fabric, they are only covered in fabric.  I think they might be made of metal.  I was momentarily pulled aside after airport security check-in scan.  I don't care, I looked cute!",4
423779,"I love Disney and wanted to represent that on my Pandora bracelet.  It goes well on the bracelet, bu the blue stones began to fade with only a few days of wear.  I would wash my hands with the bracelet on, but not shower with it so they never got more than damp.  I was disappointed to know that a lot of the blue stones were just painted blue instead of actually being blue stones.",3
383455,Great fit and look.  The nose pads take a little getting used to with this style of sunglasses.  One issue with them is that when I pull them onto my hair the nose piece sometimes snags my hair.  I'm good to go as long as I remember to NOT do that.  :),4
564247,"This pin is small but beautiful, and it was perfect for my Dad's new coat we bought him for Christmas.  It is the proper size for a lapel pin and my Dad is a minister so this was the ideal gift for him.  I LOVED the blue color behind the cross.",5
709414,"Runs surprisingly large. I own several Mud Pie brand dresses and am almost always a size L, and this was swimming on me. I'm also not thrilled, however, that the size medium or small would have cost me 5 times as much (no exaggeration). So I stuck with the large, with will still be very cute with a belt.",3
325654,"It's ok... kinda small and scratchy material and there are strings all over the inside and outside of shirt but for the price I paid, I like it ok.  It's no where near as long as it shows on the model and it's not loose. It arrived in 3 weeks though which was quicker than expected.",3
160241,"I bought this pair of socks because I am a huge fan of Daryl Dixon and ""The Walking Dead.""  The picture on the front of the sock is very nice, but the back of the sock is plain white.  I was hoping the entire sock would have had a design on it.  The sock is on the sheer side, so if you are quite overweight it will probably not fit your calf well.  They fit me well, but I wear a size 9 shoe, am 5' 6,"" and weigh 140 pounds.",3
661288,I wanted a hoddie that I could lounge around in during the summer. Something very lightweight. This was ok. Not as lightweight as stated and runs very small. I  usually wear small in Aeropostale hoddies but this was too tight for me. Very snug on the shoulders and arms and a bit hard to zip. This is one size fits all if you are very thin with a tiny chest and no jigglie bits. The material  was cozy but it pulled very easily.,3
416020,"5 stars definitely because everying about this shirt is nice. To start off with the design is very unique unlike something you can find here in the US. When wearing it feels very cool on the skin and does not get hot. This shirt is a bit stretchy because it is meant to be skin tight. Have received many compliments, and many want to know where I bought it. One word Doublju",5
594608,I have owned RB for the last 20 yrs these are real quick delivery and to boot they shipped in a crush proof box I picked up a new pair to replace the ones I had at least 7 yrs Empire has my business just bought my 2nd pair cuz I will beat em up..... And a new pair to sport on Sunday  :),5
50955,I had the size medium from my previous pregnancy and decided to get a small as well this time. After two days I was able to fit into the small and my stomach is almost back to its regular size! It's recommended to wear this for 6 weeks which I do plan to do because it gives great support!,5
232737,"Not sure if this is some sort of joke, or a fashion trend I've not caught onto, but it sure is small. Tiny. ""Holds everything you need and nothing more."" Not in my case. Driver license, three credit cards and there's a key pocket that might allow one key comfortably. Did I mention it's tiny? It's not worth sending back since I got it at a discount, but I won't use it.",2
865710,Cheap!  I love the bandage look for some things but this is semi shear and made out of very poor quality fabric.  I have bought other similar items for the same price and they are far superior so I know these things can be made for the same price with quality materials.,1
75715,"If you're a slender woman to begin with, this might be a wee bit big. I am on my 6th month and I still cannot wear it fully unrolled. When I do wear it, I have to fold it over, which I find somewhat unsightly as it gives extra bulging under my clothing in areas where I have no bulges. I do find it provides some additional support for the occasional round ligament pain. Overall, it's alright, though I wish I paid only $15.00 for it.",3
167616,I love the heather charcoal color. These pants are not too thick and not too thin. Perfect for my workouts! I am about 120lbs and the size small fits perfectly. I have washed them once and they held up to my wash great. I also have a long ankle length pair from this brand too and they are also great.  I would buy these at full price but I did receive these at a discounted rate for my honest feedback.,5
552747,"Sizing is terrible it is actually a juniors size 7 to 9, even the length is just about 3 1/2 inches shorter than stated. I read through all and converted my measurements so don't even believe what their specs say. Use the reviews about sizing before purchase and remember this takes a really long time to get to you. I think they cannot read a tape measure.",2
847655,"Bought this for my Fianc. Fits her perfectly as expected right out of the package. The shirt is really good quality and didn't shrink in the washer/dryer. Nothing bad about this shirt to note.

Pros: Fits well, Doesn't shrink, Looks great
Cons: None

746282,"Purchased for my daughter who is allergic to Nickle.  No issues with ear irritation.  No diesel smell, not funny business.  Just a nice CZ set in a hypo-allergenic setting.  It did take a bit to ship.  Strangely, it took almost a week to update the notice that it was shipping.  At 9:30 PM the day before it was to be delivered, I got the notice that it shipped.  It did, indeed, arrive the next day.",5
182488,"I purchased the smokey yellow color and it is more stunning in person the pictures doesnt do it justice, this is beautifull, my iphone 6 doesnt fit in the bag but i seriously don't mind ill just give my phone to my bf for him to put in his pocket, i really recomand this bag its STUNNING!!!!",5
71527,"Bought these shoes with HIIT in mind, but not too sure how I like the fit on my foot. First time to wear them, not great for running. Maybe after they're broken in a little they'll get better. If you just need a comfortable pair of shoes for walking, they're fine.",3
648489,I'm 5'1 and I was 138 pre pregnancy. I'm now 152. I was a 6 before so this time around I ordered an 8 because of the fabric type. I received a size L and it fit perfectly. I dressed it up for a dinner cruise we were going on and I got tons of compliments. It felt really good to wear a form fitting dress vs all of the oversized maternity clothes you see out there. I'd definitely recommend some sort of slip to smooth out the underwear lines.,5
783766,"I am 5'1"" and 123 lbs. I purchased a large because I like my clothes roomy and casual. I never want to worry about shrinkage. I can throw this in the washer and dryer and it still looks great. I dressy outfit for Christmas and I am going to use it for Valentine's day next month. I was hoping the Kansas City Chiefs would have done better for even more red attire requirements, but maybe next year...",4
175363,"This sweater is very cute.... Very soft  but thin (see through).... I give it 3 stars because it only comes in ""one size"".... Will not fit like a Dress as pictured... More like a snug long sweater...I'm 5'4 120lbs...and not ""bat wings""... Just regular sleeves.  I'm giving to my 15 year old she has a tiny waist but it will still fit like a top not a dress. Cute w legging and boots.",3
78043,"I have this band on my red pebble.  I love it with one exception: the black metal clasp peices have started to show wear after even extremely light use (I have a desk job).

Even with some shiny metal exposed from wear, it's still a great looking wrist band though.",4
702047,DO NOT ORDER!!! Everyone is correct I has also described the horrible lace as a Doyle. And they don't even sew it on correctly it sticks out everywhere. The material was a shocked to see. There were no tags on these AT ALL!! I am very new to Internet shopping and this is what I was afraid of. Back to the mall where I can inspect the clothes. I would even had $2 for this shirt if I would have seen it in person.,1
708088,"A good product that does what it is needed to do. And that is to allow your fellow K9 some protective and gear carrying qualities. I bought this for a friend and he is a fairly large dog that I bought the larger size for... but the dog is rather skinny and the straps become uncomfortable and the molle panels become rather unshapely which prevent placing pouches and whatnot on it whenever conforming to the dogs body.
Need more pictures for size comparison and fitting for dogs.",4
458495,"I love flap happy hats there versatile, they provide great sun protection, there are many styles and patterns to choose from, not to mention there so cute! There durable and last a long time. The product size seems to compare close to others.
 This is one of my favorite gifts to give.",5
528362,"The dress and the color were very appealing to look at however when I took the dress out of the packaging, I notices several strings hanging from the hems. After one wash, The color appeared to fade and I had to restitch the hem along the front bottom by hand",3
402262,"I own two pair of square type aviator glasses. I have clip on sunglasses that clip on to the prescription glasses. Sometimes they are not dark enough. So with the addition of these, especially when piloting an airplane during those bright summer months I need extra eye protection. With the flip up capability, I can lighten things up just by flipping them gives good , then back down again as needed. The polarization is handy to have against certain light wave lengths.",4
32578,"This bra isn't very supportive for me.  I wear a 42DD, so maybe it's just in larger sizes that it is not supportive.  I accidently ordered it thinking it was another Goddess sports bra that it turns out is actually being discontinued.  Just goes to show you need to check the number for the bra to be sure it's the right one.",3
56098,"This was great for my son's baptism. After reading other reviews, I ordered a bigger size and I'm so glad I did! My son is 3 months old, but is already in size 6mo clothing. So I ordered the 12mo size for this outfit, and it fit pretty well. There's no way any size smaller would have fit. One of the snaps was missing from the romper when I received it, but oh well - it just wasn't a big deal.",3
184832,"It was better than I expected. I don't buy bags a lot, but I needed something bigger and this is just the right size. I love that it had two straps and then an extra strap to make the bag longer. The only problem I have is that one of the shoulder straps already broke and I've only had the bag less than two weeks.",4
273119,"My previous earring had the male end on the post therefore making the tip a little smaller which helped to go in better. This one has a female end on the post and the rhinestone tip is the male. It makes it very difficult to get it in my cartilage. As far as looks and quality, I'm really happy with it.",3
311210,"Didn't show up in 2 days,  like they were supposed to with prime shipping.  Got them about a week later.  And the bar is super loose, and really hard to click into the hole. I bought these for my diath peircing, and they are not going to work.  I think if i was using them for a septum, id have trouble getting them in that too. And,  in the picture they look black,  but are in fact a dark silver.",2
361954,"These are very pretty. I have the violet and the color matches the photo. They actually look better than the picture.  They are fairly heavy and I can only wear them a couple of hours before they start hurting my ear from the weight. They are larger and longer than I expected. They would be just as pretty if they were about  a third of the length shorter. I really like the earrings,...so I may take it upon myself to shorten them. I would be able to wear them longer. I purchased discounted for reviewing.",4
54890,If I remember correctly it says one size fits all - That is not correct - it does not fit a small head - I can pull it down over my eyes and make ear muffs by pulling down over my ears and still have a loose fit.  I am trying to find out how I can return the cap and get a refund.  Maybe you can help me.,1
808682,"The drop on the handle is entirely too short.  Let me put it this way, it wouldn't be long enough for a little person. I am confused as to why a drop on a bag of this size would be so short.  Why can't designers get this right.  At least give buyers the option for longer handles.  So annoying.",1
330792,"Very pretty dress. I ordered a small and it's definitely a littttle too big (I'm 115 lbs and usually wear a s/m), but my biggest problem is the length. With the fringe, it goes right under my knees and I'm 5'4"". I'm going to alter it and try to pin it up onto itself so that its a little shorter and the fringe hits right above my knee. I am so happy with the quality of this dress though. Just know when you order to order a size smaller and that the slip will be short.",4
111235,Horrible product!!  Poor Quality plus it was broken when I took it out the package.  It's way too short to even put around my rear view mirror.  I never have had a bad product from Amazon.  This is my first.  I'll just try and get to the Catholic store to get another.  This shouldn't make ANY stars!!!,1
567737,"This dress is very pretty and fits as expected. The color is a very bright red. my fiance said that I looked nice in it. It is longer in length then most of my other dresses, but I like that. It is a little too low cut for my, but I just wear a tank top under it and it is perfect for work or a night out.

I received this product at a discount for my honest review.",4
728913,"Great product. Very minimal socks that are not constricting (a big plus for someone who doesn't like socks). Almost like there is nothing there. The heel portion contains slim strips of rubber that keep the sock in place. As someone who had very low expectations, I was very surprised and delighted.

As a point of reference, I wear these with Saucony Bullet shoes, and my foot size is 10.5. I have narrow feet with a wide toe area.",5
486885,"I had a feeling this would run small so I ordered an extra large. Unfortunately it does not fit. It is extremely cute though. I absolutely love this blazer. I would say that unless you can fit into a US medium once in awhile don't purchase this product. I usually wear a large so ordered one size up, but still too small. My issue is my chest though. (It won't button) Not made for curves.",5
113574,"These are so cool! They look nice and are somewhat adjustable as you can squeeze them to tighten them. I have very tiny wrists, so even when tightened, they were a bit loose, but it looked great with my costume either way. I got many compliments on them. Would definitely purchase again.",5
91272,"Haven't been in a bathing suit fo years, but found an upcoming cruise and excuse to get a new one.  Buy bathing separates is great when it comes to bathing suits.  The pants fit well and didn't look old fashioned or like grandma's bathing suit (even though they are grandma's bathing suit!).  They will do nicely for my purposes.  Haven't worn them in a pool yet, but I did wash and they held up fine.  I would recommend them.",4
381044,These are so comfortable that after a few minutes I forgot I had them on. For those of us who have nip problems and need minimizer bras that have no padding these are brilliant. I never thought I could buy a bra without padding which I do not need. I agree with the reviewer who said these are the best thing since sliced bread!,5
2887,"I bought this ring recently and the stone and setting is gorgeous! The ONLY thing that I don't like it the flatter shape band. I like a raised band on a solitaire but that is a personal preference and in no way reflects the quality of the item. For the price, I would highly recommend!!",4
298791,". . . for the price I paid and it being genuine leather!  Great buy!  I took a risk and bought 2 and am glad I did!.  The price has gone up a bit since my purchase, but it's still a steal for a genuine leather bi-fold under five bucks!!  Can't find that much anywhere these days!",5
49416,"I felt this product ran a little small, but it is supposed to be tighter. I slept in mine a lot, but I found myself waking up in a dripping sweat, so I wouldn't recommend wearing at night. Great to wear around the house and helps things tighten up a bit after the trauma of giving birth.",4
165840,"Great for the price. Perfect for Spin. Most of my leggings ride down on me when I'm working out. These fit tight and stay in place. I also like how long they are, about 2 inches longer than most other brands. I'll see how they wear with time, but they seem very durable. Will probably buy several more pairs of these. I'm a size 28 in jeans and bought a size small.",5
156932,"Just received the wallet and was very impressed. The wallet has a beauty and utility you don't often find in products today.
The understated elegance is a result of a very clean, simple design.  Construction quality is superior as evidenced by the
metal clasp and hidden, interior hinge.

The wallet has a solid, secure feel.  The packaging is also simple and elegant. I will by some for client gifts.",5
102535,I received this jacket today and it definitely exceeded my expectations. The quality and the fit is excellent. It just looks great on and feels soft and comfortable. Very good for jogging too when the days are cooler since it covers the butt. I am thinking about getting the gray one too.,5
554238,"I was so pleased to find this T-shirt about Bob! I got this T-Shirt for Fathers Day for my husband Bob. It was the perfect size and color, good quality and shipped quickly. I don't think my husband could have been happier - it was a perfect compliment to go with his ""Bob"" coffee mug.",5
242575,"Lovely ring for a great price.  True to size, comfort edges, high shine.

Looks great and can be worn in shower, while doing chores, etc.",5

220967,"This is a great product in two ways.  First, the glasses are extremely light weight because they are some form of strong plastic, they sit on the bridge of my nose and are quick and easy to use.  They are so comfortable it's as if they are not there.  Second, they slip into a specially designed iPhone case so they are always with the thing i need them the most for (MY PHONE!) for the millions of times I need to see and cannot find my glasses.  Great back-up system for traveling!  Highly recommend!",5
879201,"Good product. Very, VERY tiny. Tiny was what I wanted (using it for navel ring). That said, it's very tricky to put the ball in (I've been dealing with body piercings and jewelry for well over ten years so I'm not new to this) I don't know how rings this tiny would be able to fit around other pierced areas such as nipples, nose, even ear piercings, if the skin is thicker than the ring opening which is 2mm. Pretty tricky to get the ball on, you'll need some needle nose pliers or something to pry the hoop open.",4

The chain used for fastening was rather lightweight and came apart because the links weren't closed tightly enough. I took them to the bead shop around the corner and had the chain replaced with heavier chain for $1.30.  I wore them to my cousin's wedding, and everyone loved them. I waded in the ocean with them, and they didn't tarnish. So happy with them!",5

Who makes sweats with no pockets now a days? Can't return them cause they have been washed. So, before you buy these know that they have no pockets. Wish I could return these. I knoe now to really look at my purchases before I wash them. Really bummed about the no pocket thing.",3

The watch will not ""blink"" like it is supposed to and my only option is to either take it to a jeweler or return it. I haven't done either yet, am still trying to decide.  This is an inconvenience, therefore, only 3 stars are awarded!",3
181089,"I love these shorts!  I have purchased them in several different colors and have been happy with them all. That said, the different prints/fabrics have different fits. The solid colors tend to have stiffer seams and not as much stretch as the space dye. I do prefer the feel of the space dye but will wear them all.  I wear them for Crossfit and have not been disappointed by performance or quality.

For reference, I am a fit 5'5"" and 130 with an average size booty and the mediums fit well. Also, I wash warm/gentle cycle and hang dry.",5
7197,"I've had other carhartt pants usually a size 32. Those fit pretty good but we're starting to feel a little tight after washing. So I ordered these in a 33 and before washing them they are tighter than my 32s?!? Worst part is, because I already ripped off the tags assuming they would fit fine like my other ones I can't return them...",2
222111,"The pockets & fit are a pretty classic twill utility pant like Dickies, but the fabric is half synthetic with bit of stretch, so there's no break-in period, and they're more durable and stain-resistant, but not as soft.

The gusseted inseam give a good range of motion without straining the inseams, and the double fabric at the knees are plus if you're up and down a lot.

Good for medium-duty work pants, nice enough looking for general wear.",4
464177,"I love everything about this skirt. It took a while to get here, but that was expected. It is a perfect length for church. It does run a little small.. But the fabric is super stretchy!! So it's really not a problem. I want to buy more in other colors.",4
188452,I bought this one size up.  I'm usually a size 1X. But to brr safe I bought a 2X. The blouse is you small especially around the bust area. I'd I could reorder I may go to a 4x just to have enough room.  Buy at least two sizes up.,3
732949,"The shirt it's self is defiantly what I'll purchased but the size fitting is way over size. I am a large fit and I chose a medium size due to the review that I've read. Some we're saying it was way over size. So I figured i would take it down to a medium but a medium is still a X-Large fit. It's waaay over size. So if you're large size then I would consider going for a small. Trust me, the Medium is waaay over sized around the neck and sleeves.",1
688431,"we've also been itching to finally review this Spriggan Requiem. It's a balance-type Bey and the official partner of Shu! Like Legend Spriggan, Spriggan Requiem can spin both left AND right. It can change in between battles the exact same way by rotating the teeth on the back of the layer. Not only does the 0 disk weigh quite a bit more than your average one, the Zeta Driver can also change between 3 different modes. This Spriggan is extremely versatile and you'll be able to mix up your play style/performance very easily!",5
681204,"Im 5'5"" roughly 140 pounds with 32 DDD's. The product is one size and it fits me like a glove! The straps are adjustable and so is the lace-up corset in the back. The stockings don't come with it. The material isn't the greatest but i expected that given the price. Overall, great product!",4
790245,"Love these shorts! I wanted something to throw on for active days with the kids and these are perfect. My thighs tend to touch in the center and I worry about length and riding up as I walk, these hit at the perfect spot to keep that from happening while still being short enough to look cute.",5
40484,"These shoelaces are great. The metal tips go through the small holes in the leather athletic shoes with no problem at all. The tips seem to be solidly attached to the lace, unlike many plastic tips. And it is great to find the long 72""length available in nice colors other than black or white.",5
796105,"It's interesting that the product questions for this pencil case have to do with... shoes. Odd.

Anyway, I love this pencil case. It's adorable, it holds about twenty pens, pencils, lead refills, and highlighters. Plus it compliments my Vera Bradley backpack. It's been dropped and thrown by me a few times--you know, just standard product testing--and there hasn't been a thread out of place. I've gone through a number of pencil cases during my education and tenure as an amateur artist. I don't know if I'll ever look back after this.",5
799888,Please keep in mind this dress looks nothing like the photograph. It was a thicker material than what is shown. They met the expectation on delivery date but a little disappointed that it wasn't exactly the same dress in the picture.  Great communication regarding size and delivery time. Thank you.,2
781873,"AMAZING the other product review was crap its not grey its black and it fits my 11 year old son, if your doing a cosplay of zoom get the kingmass version if you want to get a costume for your kids get this. and if you want to make a black flash costume this is also great for arts and crafts",5
363307,"Absolutely love the design, love the material, and love the comfort. I agree with everyone else, they do run smaller so if you normally wear a XL, go with the XXL but honestly it depends on your body size, structure as well as breast size. Just compare your measurements with their chart and you should be good. I received this suit at a discounted price for my honest review and I do believe that you will be pleased if you take the advice about the sizes. It's a great suit!",5
73734,"Purchased the 2 pair, first week, the black pair had the screw come out on the arm, have not even used them daily yet!  Kind of disappointed.  It is an easy fix because luckily I found the screw, but not excited to have to do that so soon.",4
270153,"Writing is TINY the balls are big which i liked. However I was expecting the bar to be a little longer it was short. One of the balls on the piercing was loose, like it unscrewed really easy. Other than that its basically what i paid for. Its alright but i was expecting a little more",3
818162,"I am disappointed on this tank blouse. On the model, it looks a lot more flattering compared to how it looks on me. The front does not crease like how it is in the picture. Instead, it blows outward and makes you look either pregnant or full regardless if you have a flat stomach. Also,  in the picture, the lace on the back and sides are white but in person, they are similar to a cremy egg shell color.",2
489141,"These yoga pants are amazing, there super soft and comfy and just overall great I get tons of compliments about them! There a tad bit loss on me in the hip area but other then that there great, I was expecting them to be really baggy and loss and big on me because there a Medium and I'm normally a small.",5
131802,"At first I was very skeptical. I'm a little well endowed in certain areas so I have my reservations when it comes to ordering clothes on the internet. However this shirt fit great just like it should, and the colors are very vibrant and beautiful:). Now that I know what size to order I will be ordering from this company.",5
528976,"Overall, it is the type of chemo that I was looking for.  I wear it around the house when my head is cold. It is just the right weight and breathes well. I will buy some additional colors. Sometimes I add a small scarf around the hat and tied in the back when I go out",4
680467,"By looking at the picture it is obvious that this would not pass as a dress alone, using that common sense I felt it fit true to size and when I wore it with navy blue leggings and brown boots I received an insane amount of compliments. Shipped pretty fast, fabric is thicker and of good quality. I love this. (see picture, my computer won't let me turn the picture around, but you get the idea)",5
821021,"I have these shorts in many different prints and wear them all often. They are my favorite shorts to wear if I am not wearing denim shorts. Super comfy & go with just about any style top. They can be dressed up or worn casually. I wish they didn't have pockets, but they are still cute. Beware they are a bit on the shorter side when it comes to length, but that didn't bother me.",5
45949,"The Spandex printed glow in the dark catsuit fits wonderfully! Large size for( 5'4 182 pds) muscular busty girl with a derriere. It is comfortable and it really glows nicely! It is not super tight, but it does have a slight hold which is actually a benefit to holding things in the right spot. I hope this helps someone who is trying to figure out what size is best for them. There are great reviews that helped me,  but most did not indicate their type of body to the size they bought. I can't wait to wear it!",5
35370,"Arrived very fast, packed to prevent damage, worked just like real glasses, I can read again!  Biggest problem is with review process, You cannot just give the product 5 stars for a flawless transaction, good product, fast shipping, good GREEN packaging, etc. You have to write and write, and write.",5
47813,"Arrived on time. The fabric is very soft. I've worn these tights twice & holding up well so far. No bagging around the knees & no runs. The colors are bright & fun. The pattern seems to actually be printed & there is a printing seam that runs on the inside & outside of the leg. But overall, the color & pattern are not taken away from by the print line.",4
257456,though the bra top is not what I expected! the top is just a long piece of spandex fabric no support no padding no basically nothing. If you buy this item don't buy a white one like I did people can see my nipples and when its wet you can see straight through it! Not what I expected!!!!!!!!!!!,2
60721,"I have wanted a prayer shawl for a long time, but was unable to afford the often costly shawls I saw on other sites. My husband gave me this one for Christmas. It is beautiful, of fine quality and a blessing to own. Also, when Fedex cdnt find my house Watchman followed up with me. I was very impressed. Well worth the money and the talit bag that comes with it matches the shawl.",5
536448,"Colors are exactly as pictured.  Didn't expect much for the price & it suits my purpose.  I wanted something stylish & light weight & it is both those things.  It's very thin & not a functional piece as far as jackets go, just esthetic.  I normally wear a U.S. small or 4-6.  I order this in an Asian size large & it fits beautifully.  Only negative is the zipper sticks but thankfully I don't plan to use it.",5
569003,"Although pictured as shapeless and loose, the garment was form fitted for a slim figure.  The fabric was not 100% cotton and clearly had a hole in it the size of a pencil eraser.  If you are expecting anything like the picture shown for this garment, you will be disappointed.",1
406619,"Just bought this swimsuit online and it is a nice product.  I am a 31"" waist so I did go with the small.  It does show a lot so buyer beware.  I bought it in blue.  I do not have huge thighs and a small would have been too small.  They are snug on me but not cutting off my curculation.  Would buy another pair.",4
655876,"The Happy Sailed Women's Houndstooth Half Sleeves Long Shirt Dress is a nice shirt. But it runs very small. My 12yr old granddaughter will probably fit it. If you are not on the thin size. I recommend not to purchase it. And realize it is coming from China. USPS delivers the item, and their tracking system keeps you wondering, what`s going on.",4
348138,"I love this shirt! It's somewhwere between a crew and scoop neck, which I love, and it fits really nicely! I'm short, at 5'2"", so it's a little long (the pointed middle makes it almost knee length) but I still love how this fits. It looks great with leggings. Great value.

The most minimal con, there were a few spare strings hanging off the surging from underneath the bottom seam. Nothing a quick snip won't fix, I just worried it would unravel. No problems thus far!",5
329488,"By the look of it, I thought the Buckle is metal. Turns out its plastic . That was a big disappointment . The material of the belt is excellent though. The length of the belt can be cut easily with scissors and then seal the end with a candle flame. That was easy. As for the plastic buckle , it's sturdy. Will see how long that lasts. Fair buy for that price.",3
498614,"This is my THIRD  bracelet wrap and I really love them.
A friend gave me my first one and although I am not a jewelry wearer , the bracelet really appealed to me so I bought another in a different design to wear with it.
Now the third will be a perfect grouping.........and the wrap design is so comfortable and easy to wear, fitting perfectly.",5
69004,"These are awesome outdoor summer shoes for toddlers!  These stay on great, they are light weight, and they have a nice flexible sole.  The are comfortable for my son, easy to get on him, and not too bad looking for Aqua Socks!  ;)  A summer must for us.",5
230976,I bought these for my husband based on Amazon reviews and that were spot on! He says they are THE MOST comfortable underwear he's EVER owned and he's no spring chicken so he's been through a few pairs in his day. He says they keep everything comfortably in place. He loves them!,5
354966,"Wow! How Pretty! This is the 1st top I feel looks just fine without a bra! Ordered my normal size - Large - and it's great, although, there is room for bigger boobs!  I am 5'7-1/2"", 140 lbs, 34DD and I could possibly fit into a medium but I'm sticking with the large. I might order another color in Medium, just to see, since you can see from my side pics that my bra shows.",5
402176,"I purchased this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it.  It is a beautiful necklace.  It was packaged a little strangely, though.  It was in a little jewelry bag, placed in a box.  I think the box alone would've been better, but that still doesn't take away from the necklace.  Great product! I would purchase another one as a gift.",5
837925,Loveeeee it! It's exactly what I've been wanting. And I wish they made more colors. It runs a bit small tho. I'm usually a medium and I ordered a large but it was just slightly tighter than I wanted it to be so I'm gonna go ahead an order an XL to make sure it looks perfect.,5
3370,The Wonder women custom was great. Well made and the fabric was nice. The size was a little to big for me even thought I follow the size chart provided by the seller. The only thing that wasn't nice was amazon return policy. The seller say that they accept return all you have to do is print the return paper from amazon. I try but wasn't very successful. But the wonder women custom was great and the price was great.,3
162177,"I absolutely love the color and the fabric quality. However, when I tried it on for the first time, the elastic completely broke and the wrap became unwearable. I am a size 8 and purposely ordered larger (XXL) than I needed so it would be longer and looser...so I know the elastic did not break because it was too small for me. It was just not well made. :-(",2
540661,"I ordered S and it fits me OK. a bit loose under the chest and not form fitting. It hits at the knee. For reference I am 5'2"" , 103LBS, Petite XS.

The problem with the dress is the back. The back will not stay flat. Perhaps an XS would fit me better and the back would stay flat to my body. I wouldn't know. As it is, I think it's a good conservative dress if it fits you. The hips are kinda narrow because I have narrow hips and it fits. the material is good.",2
1065,"These had strings out of the seems on the lace part and lots of manufacturing issues. If you stretch them to fit over your foot it will destroy the sowing and the lace will come apart. The lace that wraps around the ankle isn't hemmed where the fabric ends in the back, so it won't make it through the wash.",1
53010,I ordered this for my two-year-old as we are in the sun a lot.  I really  like that this ties we have had other hats that have the Velcro on them and they have snagged his rash guards. I feel it is secure so will even stay on during our boat rides. I think it's really important to protect your kids from the sun as much as we can and a hat is great to save their precious skin from damage. The hat dries quickly and has a wide brim. It's a great hat!!!,5
179664,"Horrible fit, no torso. Wish I'd of listened to other negative reviews and never purchased. I'm normally a small, ordered a medium and it's way too small. Poorly made. And it comes from China, which I didn't realize when I bought it, so cost of shipping to return it would be more than what I paid for it. I'm out my money on this one:(",1
419922,"Loved the mask, but just like the other reviews, I had to cut between the teeth to make room for air.  Without it, It was like an inferno.  It got really hot inside, not sure how to reduce that - vent holes in the hair or something??  But overall, a hit.  Freaked out hundreds of kids and parents at my house. Everyone though I was fake!",4
601798,"It fits true to size. I ordered a small and it fits like a women's 4. On someone shorter like me, the sleeves just come down to over the elbows and the dress comes just above the knees.

Also, it fits more like a skater dress. It flares out and is more fitted at the waist. In the photo, it looks more like a casual swing dress.

Hard to see on model but there are 2 seams running down the front about 1/4 in from the sides. There's also a horizontal seam across the back, a bit above the bra.",4
267359,"I got this as Halloween costume, and I really like the material. In fact, it's so comfy that I might even wear it out in public beyond Halloween!

I'm 5'11"" and normally a size 18/20, so a XXL should have been fine. I opted to go with the XXXL and glad I did so, because it was a perfect fit. So I would say it runs a bit on the smaller end.",4
380443,This makes packing up my liquids SO much easier. If you have a liquid you think might leak take extra precautions since this bag doesn't provide an airtight seal like a ziplock. I was nervous at first that TSA would yell at me and tell me it was too big but I have used it on several domestic and international flights and have never had an issue. You can fit way more stuff in here than in a quart sized plastic bag AND it is more environmentally friendly!,5
130300,"I bought these after reading reviews saying they were thicker material and not see through or thin like tights. Those reviews were wrong. These are pretty much tights. I don't wear them as leggings, instead I wear them under leggings as an added layer for warmth when needed. They are see through. Very disappointed.",2
457316,"This is a great looking belt and I wear it all the time.  I did have an issue with the belt splitting and then breaking at the point of buckle.  I sent the company an email and they responded quickly and were kind.  They sent me another and I was again pleased with th product.  Then about 2 months in, it split and broke at the buckle place again,",4
666417,"Absolutely awful design. I've never purchased a belt that had to be assembled! Which wouldn't have been that big of a deal if it wasn't for the fact that the belt buckle had to clamp down on the belt. Have you ever tried to drive something through leather!! After 15 minutes of struggling with pliers, mallets, and our damn body parts, my wife and I gave up.

So on the plus side, the leather is tough as hell. The downside is we couldn't even put the belt together. It's a damn shame!",1
863136,If you buy these buy a 1/2 size bigger>>>I would of sent them back however my daughter love them so much that she forced her feet in. She will maybe get to wear them a month then I'll give them to hopefully to a niece. They are to small >>>>,3
365738,"It would look really nice but the color is not the color shown in the pictures. My hair color is very light so I ordered the light ash and bleach blond and I got something that was a light brownish, off blond color. I don't think I can even find a dye for my hair to match the color. I wanted to wear it at a wedding but I don't think I can wear it at all. It didn't cost much so I don't feel too ripped off,",2

My 3 star rating was because upon receivin them I opened the box and realized that they came in a plastic bag instead of a case. so of course I went back to amazon to see if there was something that my husband and i overlooked where it said ""sunglasses woc"". There was not, so I had to find something to keep my sunglasses in to prevent them from scratching because they do fit perfect.",3

434835,Very Low diamond quality! I took the rings to  a jewlery store and they told me that was a very poor quality diamonds and is not sparking like the pictures. I have the bands against my engagement rings and you can see the difference of the diamonds color and quality.

184039,"I am 5'8"" and this is an above the knee dress on me.  I wore it with leggings and it was very comfortable and cute.  Better quality than I was expecting and received very quickly.  Many Allegra K items run small.  This does not.  Fit is loose and true to size.  Can also be worn with the bottom band pulled up to hips as a baggy top.",5
649129,"I thought it would be smaller since I assumed Asian sizing. But it was a little on the bigger side for me, but that was my mistake when ordering. There is no support at all for the top and it looked almost like a jogging outfit. It was still cute, but maybe if I had ordered a smaller size, it would've been cuter.",3
159919,"This took a while to receive but was worth the wait. The color is great and it hangs well.  I have worn it for Valentine's day, but also with some of my sweaters.  It's a good scarf for every day and dresses up many of my work outfits.",5

Having never purchased such an expensive top, it was an investment and so I took a chance.  I'm 5'4"" 120 lbs., and normally a medium fits perfectly.  This medium was at LEAST 2 sizes too large!  Not only that, but the top has no flowing curves coming down the front--it looks like a huge tent on me!!!  What a waste of my time and money.

642630,"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. I feel very glamorous in this blouse. It is also versatile, matching almost any color skirt or pants. Hence, while expanding my wardrobe by one top, I have expanded my overall outfits almost infinitely. My only complaint is that the fabric snags too easy, so I have to be careful what jewelry I wear with it.",4
117410,Love this kilt. Fits perfectly. Material is nice and heavy I don't have to worry about a breeze blowing up the back end and exposing anything. Side pockets are very handy. I wore this on my trip to New Orleans and it was so comfortable in the humidity. Will definitely buy another one.,5

I bought a set in both a 5 and a 6 and the 5 was definitely too snug for my size 5 ring finger, so returned that but kept the size 6 set as it is comfortable for most of my fingers. I may not be able to wear these in warmer weather. The metal and stones are brilliant and I do not notice chafing between fingers as others mentioned.",4

He just opened them up and they are so short, they will be lucky to reach his upper thigh. I even typed in long boxers in the search field. I am so disappointed with the boxers and so is my husband.",1

739343,Beautiful dress that was perfect for a high school dance.  It was not too revealing which I liked and was long enough for my 5'9 daughter with heels and wasn't too short.  It may need hemmed if you are not tall but for her it was perfect.  I would buy again in a heartbeat.  Looked more expensive than it was.,5
302059,"I love the look of this purse, and the price was amazing. Not super high quality, but enough that it hasn't broken yet, and I put my purses through the wringer. Love the adjustable strap, convenient for across chest wear, while out on the motorcycle. Only negative I had was the chain around the top moves around a lot and you may end up with an uneven chain decoration that needs adjusting frequently (personal esthetics preference, for me)",5
40174,I have often purchased cheap flip flops- I was hoping for a better quality flip flop.  They are alright but  I think I spend more money on a nicer pair or just buy the cheap ones.  I can't find any reason to purchased these instead.  They have mor cushion under your foot but I'm not sure it was worth the extra expense.  I would not purchase these again.,3

By far worse dress I've got online! I don't normally write reviews but this is some crap! Could deal with the fabric being see thru if the sewing was done correctly! Also belt way too little! The picturse are of the corner of the chevron and the stitching coming out of seams!,1
871685,"This item came today, 10 days before the arrival time of 12/27.  It is a Christmas gift for a friend, but it is AWESOME! I love it! So, I am sure my friend will, too!  It is a little bigger than I expected, but that is SOO COOL! Great item!",5
37116,"There service was great. Especially with a bad USPS shipping issue. My one complaint was the bright pink ties listed were actually light pastel pink and not what we really wanted or needed. But I would certainly do business with them again, I would just email them before I made my purchase. [...]",4
719630,"This is a great fit and it's official. I ordered another from amazon and it was not as expected. With that said, I am more petite and Asian style clothing fits me very well. So the one size fits all is for a smaller -medium build or a  juniors one site fits all. Nice and warm too",4
268205,"This is the PERFECT purse for an AMAZING price!  I wanted something small enough to wear cross-bodied without being heavy, bulky and in my way.  Yet I needed it large enough to EASILY hold my iPhone 6sPlus in it's bulky Otterbox case besides all the basic wallet/purse items a woman carries.  THIS IS THE PURSE!
High quality, supple leather, two strong strap options, HEAVY-DUTY zipper and pull.  This whole purse has very pleasantly surprised me.  I can't believe I found such a perfect fit, exceptional quality at such a great price!",5

I absolutely love the way it fits... I went by the reviews and so I purchased a 3x and it works just fine. I am 14-16w so I truly hope this review helps you with making an awesome decision :-)",5
366049,"I ordered a size large. I have wider hips and a larger bottom, and the bottoms do not fit at all. I wear a 34DD from VS and the top fits fine. The quality is nicer than I expected since the price was so low. I needed a size or two bigger on the bottoms but then the top wouldn't fit, so if you do not have large hips then you should be fine. I still love it even though the bottoms are too small.",4
746682,"4 out of 5 stars simply because they all were really difficult to adjust - the metal clasp kept catching the fabric on two of the belts ( not to mention almost ripped a significant chunk out of the pink one). On the other two, the metal clasp was just difficult to get to start moving up and down.

On the plus side, these belts fit my 3.5 year old daughter perfectly though and she seems to like them very much. All of them are cute and I love how they can go with almost any outfit.",4
46722,"Perfect for when a hat makes your head too hot but your ears still get chilled by the wind. Also for when you want to cover your ears but not mess up your hair. Had no problems getting them on, and they stay on quite securely. Just what I was looking for.",5
56289,My daughter was eyeing a bracelet similar to this one at the mall and so I got this one instead and she loved it. She is very excited about the multiple colors and the beads are printed correctly except one. It sticks out to me because it has too much white but she doesn't seem to care.,5
488358,"This was really disappointing. As the headline says, these don't seem to be filled with cotton or anything practical like that, it seems to be filled with plastic. When moving around you can hear the continuous crunching of plastic inside of the ear warmers. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone",1
856152,"You get what you pay for. But I have to say my son loves these. Just started kindergarten and can put them in by himself (which is why I brought them) after 2 wares, some of the color in the rubber if the soles had already peeled off. But for school they are great. Light weight, easy to get in or off and totally sporty cute.",4
39412,Love these!!! So freaking comfy and soft!! I got a size medium in men's even though I am a small in women's because I wanted a very loose and spacious fit and I couldn't be happier! A bit long but i fixed that by sinching it with hair ands and tucking the extra. :),5
518851,"Very nicely done.  I would like to have seen a date or dates in the design, even if on the back side.  I know the dates, but my sons will not later on when I'm gone, and let's face it -- the target audience for these is of my generation who served n Vietnam.",4

269149,I've been using this purse every day since I ordered it. It is big enough to hold everything I carry around with me and still have room for more. I especially love the different handles that give me options for how I want to carry it around. My only complaint is that some of the pockets have torn and can't be used anymore.,4
808905,"We bought these at Kohl's last summer and they did not fit daughter this year and kohl's no longer sold them. Was so excited that I found on amazon! A bit more than I wanted to spend but she loved the fit of these so well and is picky about her clothes that it was worth it. Not too short, not too long.",5
374154,"I like the clasp in the front, but that's about all I can say. First, it is too small and I am BARELY a C-cup, so it should have fit great. Second, it wouldn't stick on the sides, so it feels like it's constantly going to come off. But I DO like that, with less revealing tops, all you can see is the added cleavage ;)",2
509788,"I guess XL in Asia is a medium here in the US keep that in mind.
I either have to drop some inches around my hips.
The material is nice, the design too, but when I put it on it fits super tight around my hips and waist.
In my opinion the material below the waist can be wider especially for a size such as XL.
I'll have to gift it out or you know...",3
603053,"People writing reviews that are upset that this isn't real leather is like writing a review on white milk expecting it to taste like chocolate.
These straps are a good value for $7. They're PU Leather. Again...man made leather. Faux leather. That said, they come from China so expect to wait a couple to three weeks.
They feel good one the wrist. Extremely lightweight and comfortable. Easy to wear all day long. I liked them well enough that I ordered 2 more.",4
506323,This is a wonderful product. Modesty (Hijab) is not meant for women only but also for men. This swim suit is perfect and fulfills the purpose. Also the little tie strings to pants hoops on the sides prevents the top from floating up while in water. The fabric is very nice and comfortable. Whole body UV thanks,5
377461,"I love this suit and I just bought another in a different color. I'm 5'4"" 140 and the medium fit well. The bottoms were borderline too small but I have a booty. If I had gone a size bigger than it wouldn't have fit across the small of my back. The top fits really well! I'm a large B small C",5
110804,"I was excited to get this in, thinking that the rose in the middle was going to be a nice whiteish ivory color, instead it came in with a very yellowy urine like color. Does not look attractive one bit. Took the beauty of the photo away...Debating on whether or not to paint over it or give it away...Not happy :[",2
611180,So mad this would of fit me when  I  was in a training  bra. Little  kid sizes and I have 34b boobs which victoria secret is where I  got sized and that makes it proof that  this product  sucks. I will never buy another  swim suit from this person or seller. Very disappointed  and  they shouldn't  be allowed to sell on amazon  anymore.,1
798548," Oh my god, let me just say these are the hands down the best cheap pair but with good quality of sunglasses I've ever owned. The rose gold color is so pretty, it's exactly as pictured. If you're debating about whether or not to get them, don't hesitate because you won't be disappointed.",5
838391,"So Im normally an L in normal human sizes, but saw reviews on this stating it ran small so ordered an XXL to be on the safe side. I figured $11.00 so what the heck. Well, it arrived today and I couldn't even get one thigh into the dress. The XXL fits my sister who wears a size 0. DO NOT BUY THIS DRESS!!! It may seem like a good idea but it isnt. Fabric isn't anything like the photo or description. Its see through. Its terribld. Absolutely terrible. Dont waste your money.",1
723319,"I was dumb enough to order 2 sets of these because I wear so much black and normally with gold jewelry.  I thought I could put two larger bracelets with one set of smaller bracelets.  Not happening because the large black bracelet on one set came in not put together properly and needs to be restrung on smaller stretch string and the smaller bracelets are very small and bit tight for my 7"" wrist.  Would not recommend.",1

My skirt size is 2-4. I ordered a medium. Couldn't even get the skirt on.
Wish I would have known this in advance. At the time I ordered it, there were no posted reviews.",3
514447,"Absolutely loved this dress, was the hit of the party. The only thing others should know is this dress seems to run one size small. I ordered and 8 and it fit more like a 6. The seller was more than helpful to get me the right size and sent a 10 that fit like an 8.",5
666881,"I ordered a medium, since ordering up a size is what the reviews seemed to imply. I'm 5'4 and 125 lbs., 32DD. The top fit really well, but the bottoms were way too large, didn't fit my torso right. Also I ordered it in the pink, thinking it was a darker hue like the pic shows, but its a bright almost Barbie pink. Will be returning/exchanging. Hopefully a size small will work out better in a different color.",3
434216,I have to send this back because it is cut too small for my XL Dad.  He wanted a flannel shirt with quilted lining and snaps.  Those requirements were met (but why is there a button instead of a snap at the topmost position?).  But the shirt is too small.,3
453573,"My bracelet arrived very fast. I was looking for something that wasn't to expensive.
I saw this and ordered it. It's so shiny and fits perfect I have tiny wrist and bracelets
are always too big. But this fits perfect. And I love the mesh. If your looking for something
different this is it.
I have ordered from Bling Jewelry before and they always do a great job thanks Bling Jewelry
I love your products.",5
791673,"We love this little pouch! We are using it as our ""go bag"" for our electronic cords for when we travel. The bags meant for that were too big, too small, or had too many little pockets, or a certain number of elastics. We love the simplicity and the size of this pouch.",5
586614,"Very happy with this hat. We live in DC and need a hat/scarf for the winter but my son always pulls them off. This stays on and he doesn't seem to mind it as much as some other hats. Soft enough that it doesn't irritate him, but he doesn't have particularly sensitive skin. As a bonus, it's super easy to find him on the playground.",5
215889,The mittens themselves are great and they fit my not yet 2 year old son fine. My issue is that I received not the colors pictured and no where did it state that assorted colors will be shipped. So I received pink mittens while expecting a green pair in the mix. I contacted the seller and while responsive they were not very helpful. I'm keeping the mittens because we desperately needed them. But I'll give 3 out of the 6 mittens to friends with girls.,3
390753,"These are so cute. These are very comfortable and don't hurt. Just be sure to squeeze them while they're on your ear and make sure it feels secure.

I am so glad it is still available at this more than reasonable price.  It does hold everything that I need, and everything is organized for easy retrieval.",5
351861,I love these boots.  They are sleek and slim and make me feel like I did when I was younger.  They look great with jeans or slacks and are extremely comfortable.  I ordered my regular size 8 and they fit perfectly.  I wear a thinner sock with them because thick socks make them too tight.  I lost all of my shoes in a flood and it was a pleasant surprise to find something so soft and nice on line.,5
607462,"I love this dress.  I ordered it for my sister in law's wedding and it arrived in two days.  Like other reviews said, it is extremely long and will need to be hemmed, but otherwise, I am happy.  The zipper is very hard to manipulate but i solved that by leaving it zipped and putting it over my head.  A little more difficult to get on that way but much less hassle than trying to work the zipper.  Great value for the money and looks great on.",4
137615,"I hated waiting.. But when they came, they were sooooo worth the wait! They are super soft, and just amazing! They are the same size though.. I see the reviews that say the white one is smaller? No? Mine were both the same size. I do not mind. They are a very nice quality. I like the pigments on them! Very colorful. I like the brown one a lot! It's just beautiful. Overall, I would recommend seller and product!",5

219263,"These mittens were not as pictured. They don't have the sports balls on them and are just plain navy, so not what I expected. Also, don't seem that they are entirely waterproof because the top side is just heavy fleece, but we haven't had any snow yet to know for sure!",3
855487,"I think this is a very slim t-shirt. I bought it as a gift for my mom, and she's 128, usually a medium. The medium fit her well, but snug. It's nice to note that the sleeves are very feminine, which is a nice departure from the masculine mass-produced t-shirts out there.",5
526964,"Excellent quality fabric and construction but small. The sleeves are very short on me and I struggle to get out of it when pulling it over my head. I bought a medium. I'm 5' 6"" and weigh 130. A large would be better but I wonder if the sleeves would still be too short. They are just shy of midway between my wrist and elbow. It's too bad because the flannel is thick and comfortable and it's well constructed.",4

It comes in a small red ring box. Remember, you are not buying a $200 ring, so don't expect it to look or feel like one. You're buying a very inexpensive piece of costume jewelry.

The belt that came in the mail was light brown in color and looks nothing like the one pictured, it doesn't even sport the same ""bling."" VERY disappointed!!!!

Should have searched more got what I wanted in a brick and mortar store where what I see is really what I get.",1
385599,"Wear this for work as a server. Very flowy and not too short. Runs a little large, so think about maybe getting a size down, unless you like extra room in dresses. I've noticed this dress is sometimes a little sheer in certain light, but just near the chest area for me. Overall very happy with this purchase.",4
154836,"Very soft cotton, fits around the hip if you are a 5ft 7 like me.  It took a looong time to get here due to the snow storm and the Christmas season  - and problems with carriers being unprepared for the volume of delivery they had.  But I think the 33-day wait was worth it.  It's casual chick and very comfortable.  But don't expect it to be as loose as in the model in the picture.",4
405355,"I agree with Traci: the diamonds-by-the yard necklace is lovely. The diamonds are white and sparkly: like little stars draped around your neck. The price is wonderful as well. For anyone who has wanted diamonds-by-the yard, like I have for a long time, why wait when you can get them for such a reasonable price? Ross-Simons continues to impress me! I ordered the piece on Monday and it's around my neck as I type this review. :o)

A Canadian Shopper pleased once again.",5
722703,"This coat is nice for the fall and early winter in Indiana. It is a worsted fleece, so it is light and soft, but it is also really warm.  As is warned by the seller, the sizes run VERY small.  I ordered the XXL (I'm a size 16 normally) and it is a little tight.",4
410883,"Went by the reviews two sizes larger,  big mistake way to big a med or large would have likely fit. Not impressed with the quality:  size zag stitching for all finished edges, the color was a dull gray . The add photo looked like a deeper blue grey.",2
413434,"They looked great but the one size fits all is a joke. My wife has average size feet ( size 9 womans US) and these were entirely too small. They look good in the collection with the rest of the stuff, just don't plan on wearing them if you are over 5'6""",3
138318,"So they aren't the most stylish pair of glasses I've ever put on, but my eyes are becoming very sensitive and I absolutely have to wear sunglasses when I drive.  These are perfect darkness to take some of the sting out of my eyes.  They're very dark and the lenses are very clear.  I'm buying a second pair for the other car.",5
724244,Beautiful color although it was more pink than coral.  Also the length was nowhere near as long as it looks in the picture.  I bought it in hopes that it'd be an extra long cardigan but it was just a regular fit sweater.  The picture is very deceiving.,2
589229,Like other people that have written reviews I also ordered 2 sets (for my daughter's birthday) and received the exact same 2 bundles. A couple of them were really cute but the rest were ugly. I ordered another set a couple of weeks ago and they were all adorable so I ordered her 2 more. I won't be wasting my money at this place again. it can not be random if they send the same things every time!,2
292943,"These are beautiful and well made. They are fairly heavy and sturdy but too small to fit on my nipples. No fault of the maker, but since they are so sturdy there was no give in the jewelry to spread them to get to fit. I will be returning them.",4
793130,Don't waste your money!  If I could give these zero stars I would.  Sock don't stay on at all regardless of the type of shoe worn.  I gave a couple to my sister to get her take and she had the same issue; these slip right off inside the shoe within the first steps taken.  Total waste of money!,1
59938,"I wear these socks around the house every single day. They don't slip on my wood and tile floors. They aren't too tight around the ankles, which is an issue I have found with other socks. However, one does eventually go missing like every sock known to man. So, I am happy I can buy them on Amazon :)",5

This one is made in India so the print design includes real Shiva tridents! Love this dashiki and plan to get more of this exact one.",5
285017,"I like these for non work days- they are charming and match the ad well. The arc of stars doesn't stay perfectly where you put it when you put them on, but minor adjustments from time to time easily solve that (they really do look better from some positions than others.)

459545,"These fit great and seem super comfy for my toddler, 16 months old. However, after about a month of wear, they already are wearing out, holes in the toes, etc. If they were longer lived I'd give them 5 stars, but they are not, they are very short lived unfortunately.",4
351102,Love this dress.  It is super comfortable and I got so many comments.  It is a little short though so I wore tights with it.  I am 5 ft 7in and 160lbs and ordered a M.  I was worried about the top b/c I am a D cup but it is stretchy material.,5
456665,I bought these glasses at a big box store and L0VE them!!!  They are very stylish and well made. They are comfortable to wear and provide  excellent protection from the sun.  We got a free gift with the glasses.  We have no idea what this is.  It has a black vinyl rectangle that has a black vinyl tab across the middle of the rectangle with velcro on the right end.  See photo.  Money clip??,5

339399,"Every pair of these gloves is cute. My 3 year old granddaughter grabbed the purple ones with delight. They fit her well, no strings to impede her fingers going in.

They are more than substantial enough for winter in Chicago, for snow playing probably would have to have an under layer.

I put the other pairs away as we all know she will lose a couple over the winter.

Great value.",5
822343,"The dress is beautifully made.  My daughter got tons of compliments about how stunning the dress was.  The lace was not itchy at top because they used a smooth liner underneath.  The skirt needed shorten as it was too long.  Also, I had emailed the vendor about concerns with it getting here in time.  They responded quickly and were very professional.  We got it three days before the expected delivery.  My daughter loved the dress!! Thank you!!",5
236598,"This is a great little bag!  I ended up buying a 2nd one.  The first one I ordered was quickly confiscated by my daughter - she loves it!  She says it has a spot for all her things and everything is easy to access.  For me, it's a great bag to use on lighter days when I don't need to carry all my stuff.  I really like the zippered pockets, the size and efficient use of space.",5

It is a little bigger than I wanted, but I'm glad because I have yet to wash it, so I'm hoping it will shrink a LITTLE in the washer/dryer. I normally wear a medium.

135069,"I ordered these for my daughter as I saw something similar on the barista at my local coffee stand.  These are extremely soft inside and out which is really nice.  Unfortunately the run very, very small and the print on them looks sort of faded and cheap.  I would not  buy these again and given how faded the coloring is, I wouldn't even give these to one of my daughter's friends who might be able to fit into them.",2
651309,"I love this purse.  Such a good value, and very good quality also.  And a wallet is included.  Luckily, I haven't had to draw my gun from it, but seems like it would be easy to do if necessary.  I did purchase velcro strips and a holder for the gun, to keep it more secure and easier to access than if it were just free in the zippered compartment.  Also, the holder covers the trigger, which I like.",5
335491,"It would have been perfect.  The size was exactly what I was looking for and since I am planning on using it as a wallet most of the time, the fact that the leather doesn't look very genuine doesn't even bother me.  The only thing I don't like, surprisingly, is the smell.  It's a very strong odor and very unpleasant.  Going to try fabreeze, or a dryer sheet or something and hope it gets better because I really like it otherwise.",4
706850,"great find!  Item arrived on time, and fit as expected. I usually wear a size 2-4 and got the medium based on reviews and sizing chart (I know I have a 27in waist) and I am satisfied with the fit.  Weird that there is no tag about care or material, but came back online and found it in the description.",4
703376,I love these bracelets. I buy a ton of them. They are exactly as the picture and for the price I have some in all different colors and designs. I also use them as gifts. The price is so cheap I will send one by mail to family and friends every time I see one that I think they will like. For two bucks I can put a smile on the face of someone I love. Who wouldn't want one. I will definatley buy from this company again,5

One big bummer is that it says hand wash and air dry only (but I did dry on low before I saw that).
Hope these help with the scar but it's too early to tell.",4
113028,The glasses are just the right size as indicated on the website. They fit very well and are comfortable to wear. It was perfect. I worry them outdoors on a sunny day in San Bernardino and was able to view the actions of the motorcycle races very well. The images were sharp and crisp and kept down the glare very well. I would highly recommend these.,5
469820,I received my dresses in 5 business days way faster than expected I ordered two black and mustard im very curvy 5'4 150 i ordered a lrg and both fit exactly the way i want them i absoutley love them I dressed it up with a pair of strappy steve madden and was complimented all night i will be ordering two other colors,5
40467,"These seem to come untied more frequently than other shoe laces. Maybe it's due to the metal tips being heavier, I'm not sure. Also the metal tips make noises when they tap the ground as you walk but mine might just be too long for me. So I stopped using them. I do love the color though.",2
362474,"I only need glasses occasionally for reading and then usually can't find them..lol. Nice size for glaases only..not in case.  Color as pictured, stable when glasses are in.  Only negative, reason for 3 stars, is interior plush lining not fully glued in place.  Overlaps enough that not worth sending back.",3
744259,"Note, this case isn't a real LG G4 Quick Circle case from LG, so cheap quality was expected. But, it was worse than i imagined it would be. Within a WEEK the edges began breaking off. So now I don't even use the case. I mean i expected cheap quality from a $5 knockoff of a $49 case. But didn't expect it to be this cheap.",2
256251,I bought this for my wife. She is allergic to most fake jewellery. She was not allergic to this at all so it must not contain nickel. She was very happy with the necklace and lover the glow of it. I ended up buying 2 more because of the great price.,5
436318,"This shirt seemed like it would be great, but it was super tight in the size I normally wear. It reminds me of the athletic shirts that are really snug in its fit as well as material.  I was also disappointed in the length.  I returned it, and won't repurchase another.",2
214904,"Was a little skeptical about the fit first after reading others comments about vests but this vest fit to a T! Was very happy with it. Hopefully to help some others I am 5'11 215lbs. I usually wear a 16.5 34/35 in my dress shirts.

Aside from that it was a hit at the valentines day party I went to everyone said it looked great!",5
292643,"Another instance of ""you get what you pay for.""  I should have ordered one (and maybe two) size(s) larger than I wear.  As is, fly won't close entirely, and my ass feels like it's being strangled.  Size I ordered is size I wear in all other brands/styles.",2
231923,"Bought these for my husband for christmas. He tried them on and threw them in the washer, and they came out with the waistband already ripped and coming apart. These are way too expensive for that. I don't know if I just got a defective pair, but it was extremely disappointing.",1
600976,"Love this style so much I have two in different colors.  30dd is my usual and fit perfectly.  I'm short and love the fully adjustable straps.  I also love the shape of the cups, perfect for wide and fuller on bottom.  Provides projection and separation without loose fabric at the top of the cups, a common issue for me.",5
337484,"It did lift my booty somewhat, but it was so tight around the midsection that it pushed my stomach fat into an unflattering position and made me look even more heavy. And although my butt looked lifted in certain outfits, in certain other things there were very obvious lines from the fabric squeezed around my butt and thighs. All in all it wasn't what I was hoping for.",3
316889,boots were horrible. Material was bad and while my daughters feet were in the boot they fell off after about 50 feet consistently. I tried it with several thicknesses of socks and bare feet. The feet were really in the boot so the boots weren't too big just the ankle material was built pretty poorly.,1
91473,"These beach shorts fit me comfortably because they sit at my waist level, not below the waist as pictured here.  The weight of this fabric is just a little lighter than my swim skirt, making them easier to move around in the water and also drying out after my swims.  I'm very happy with them and recommend them to others who want an alternative to the swim skirt.",5
413697,I just got this item today in the mail. It shipped very fast I was surprised.  I opened the box and was surprised to see that it was just as cute as in the picture. I think that octopus jewelry is so cute and this piece is a very good inexpensive piece that I think will be fun to wear. I'm very pleased with it (especially for the value!).,4
431654,"This looked good when received, but after one wash was SO wrinkled, and harsh cotton-feeling that I don't like to wear it.  I know - it was 100% cotton, but at $20, I expected a better weave of cotton.  Very disappointed.  Will not buy Carol Wright again.",2
208265,"I don't like this at all. I thought it would lay nice, it did not. It made me look fat (I'm no super model...but not a fat girl either!)The brand is not same as advertised, looks like something similar was sent. Its awful. I plan to send it back, just haven't got that far yet. If I actually got the advertised brand, it might have been cute. But no...awful! I will say one positive thing...I received early...before the stated time. That was nice.",1
432986,"I ordered this for a night out with the girls. Upon receiving it, I noticed that it was cheaply made, but cute. It has sort of a weird fit to it, but size wise, it fit as expected. I am glad that it was not expensive, since it was not the quality I was hoping for. Needless to say, it did not come out of the closet much. The picture makes it look so much cuter than it is.",3
761956,"This is a Vinyl Purse, NOT Leather, as stated in some of the reviews. It is also almost a ""brick"" red, not as bright as the picture indicates. Definitely a ""Fall"" season purse.  I miss the signature D & B  braided zipper pull to and should have splurged on a leather Tote instead. This inside is a cheesy red vinyl, not an attractive color, instead of D & B's signature red fabric.",2
659259,"Thank goodness this yoga pant was of good quality!!!
It is so soft and is thick so it's not see through.
It does make me get sweaty though.
I love the print!!! It's so beautiful.
I got a size large and it stretched enough to fit me nicely and snuggly.
The top portion does roll down though.
I'll be buying more especially at this awesome price!",5
584784,"Very happy with the purchase. It came quicker than expected. Although, it did come as neon orange, which I actually like better than the burnt orange that is shown in the sellers picture. The top fit great but is a little see-through in the nip area, and the bottoms fit too, but are a little bunchy in the front and butt area (due to a smidge more fabric than should be there). Other than those minor things, it fits pretty well and my boyfriend loves it. Can't wait to wear it on vacation.",3
205470,"This is darling. So adorable I wear it all the time. It is very light and comfortable. The tassels have started pull but I don't care it adds character and I just trim them off. Shipping was crazy fast! Concidering it was come from china. I wear this as a cover up for a sleeve less dress, with shorts, when it was breezy in the summer, to weddings, church and everyday wear. It goes with most everything I have. I have told all my friends about it.",4
349207,"Very pretty for sure- but definitely meant for someone with a larger nose or a longer face. I am a female with a small-ish nose, and this ring looks HUGE on my face. I absolutely love the opal stone, and the stainless steel was a big deal for me since I am allergic to most jewelry. I wish it was a little smaller, but otherwise, very cute. I ended up giving it to a friend with a bigger nose and it looks great on her.",3
406905,If you are serious about purchasing a belly dance outfit. GO with this one. It is so beautiful in person that the wait is def worth it. The sequence is stunning. It really makes me feel so beautiful and sexy. Shipping was quick but my item got lost In transaction. Which was ok becuz they were really good with sending me another ASAP.,5
409393,"This is one of the best ""smile bringing"" items you can ever purchase. Yeah, the price is a bit much, which is why I rate it a 4. I'd still consider it a must have, nonetheless. There's always a day to reveal this wallet of glory. Oh! Before I forget...It comes with a moustache sticker that you can place in front of your I.D.",4
578384,"It's all good. but missing a few interior pockets. Well, there is a pocket for iPad. But why there is no inner pocket for a smartphone. To use external pocket for smartphone in winter is not correct. The smartphone will cool down and the battery will run out quickly. Add at least one inside pocket.
The fabric is great, jacket warm think to -15 degree Celsius.",5
863296,Fits about a size smaller than listed but I still love it! I ordered a 2X to be safe and its more of an XL so If you want it to be more of a loose fit definitely order up a size or 2..fits me a little snug but did not loosen up and stretch out and lose its shape like a lot of  clothes do when they start off snug.  Sleeves are more of a 3/4 sleeve but I don't mind.,4
720076,"the ring is very nice, if careful you can bend it to fit your finger without damaging it. it's not too fragile. it has more detail than I thought it would. I like it a lot, the only bad thing is how easily it turns my finger green. otherwise I'm happy with it!",4
75609,"Because of these, I can still wear my regular jeans right now. I am currently 5.5 months pregnant. I would highly recommend these if you don't want to spend the money to buy maternity jeans. I got the color black because it hides the zipper and buttons better. But through out the day, you will still notice your pants falling a little bit and have to readjust.",4
12822,"Second time buying these, Im on my feet all day and nothing compares to these inserts. The first time I stepped in them I knew they were great. The support is amazing. I'm not gonna switch them between shoes as often this time to try to preserve them. Give them a shot!",5
594737,"I love it, I am 5'5 and i weigh 130. It is long, and it looks just as the picture shows!! The material is awesome and thick!! I am so happy I was able to purchase this for my trip to Florida. The delivery was fast as well. Thank you for being a great seller!!",5
666609,"Material was good. I read reviews which said it ran small. I'm 5'1 and 115 and ordered a large, it was still a little tight around the butt area and flattened my chest out. The padding it comes with is akward as hell lol. I removed that and replaced with another swim suits padding and it looks great! Definitely order at least 2 sizes up!",4
319786,"Very cute ring! I love it and it looks just like ti does as pictured. My only note would be that although it is adjustable (you can bend it to open more), it seems like it's meant to be a mini ring i.e. only slides down on the finger to the first knuckle, not all the way down the finger where you would wear a normal ring. But this doesn't bother me, I actually think it's cuter this way.",4
33247,"I ordered these to go in my old-style hiking boots, so I was pleased with the substantial silver metal tips (Aglets) which are not shown in the photographs. They would be a problem in shoes with small eyelet holes. Apparently these are made to order, as there was no label or packaging, just tiny rubber bands around them. Service and shipping were very fast.

Bottom line: very good laces for boots and sneakers, not so much for dress shoes. I'm very satisfied, and will order again if needed.",4
179598,Everybody you are supposed to wear a shirt under it because it is a crop top. I swear how can you people not know this. it says so in the title and description. Like it annoys me because they don't know what they are talking about. You don't wear this by itself.,5
22901,Nice product. I used it on a pair of new boots that needed a little extra width. I also used it on a pair of hi-top shoes. I had to stuff a hand towel in the heel part to keep it from sliding back and that worked out good. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a high quality shoe stretcher.,5
831913,"Do NOT waste your time ordering this suit. The product is extremely cheaply made and if you wear a bra size larger than an A cup, this suit will barely hold you in.
I contacted the seller requesting a return and have been given the run around. He/she was extremely condescending implying that I must need a bigger size (I'm 5'3"", 120lbs, ordered size small) and kept referring to me as 'deary'. ""Deary, why no gift to relative or friend?""
FYI, this product is shipped from China making returns near impossible anyway due to cost.",1
306693,"I really like the material of this shirt, if fact it was exactly what I was looking for. However, the shirt is way to small. I usually wear and large/extra large, but this shirt is too snug to wear, even around the house. I really wish they would do away with ""one size"" and come out with another level of sizing for those of us with wider backs and bigger b**bs. If my friend doesn't want these, I'll be sending all 4 back that I purchased.",4
63229,"I got a lot of compliments while wearing this costume. I do not however like the material. the top is a velvety texture and the bottom is shiny. The cape itches, the arm guards were too big, and the boot covers just did not work. The concept was nice and it would've looked great if everything fit properly. Side note, it doesn't come with a rope. Wonderwoman needs her rope.",3
696865,These running tights are extremely soft and very comfortable to wear. They are sized a bit small...I normally wear size 5/6 women's pants and mediums. I ordered a large and the fit like my medium running leggings. They were great to run with and wicked away the sweat from my legs. I love the v-cut on my stomach. I received a discount for leaving a review. But I will be ordered more of these.,5
449526,It took awhile to get but I love this necklace. I got it for my brother and he wears it everyday.  It can be a little sharp so be careful.  But I highly recommend it above others.  Care was obviously put into its creation and is a great gift for male and female alike.,5
321037,"I love it! I'm a size 2, but after reading reviews I went up a size (size 4). I'm about 120lbs 5'3 and I suggest ordering a size up. The waist part of the dress ended up to my midriff, but it'll do. I can rock it with a crop top.",4
713873,"Fits a bit awkward on the top. Not as figure flattering as in the picture (for the plus size). But the dress is gorgeous, And with a bit of alterations, its amazing. I love it. Although I did the measurements the dress still ran big. And at 5'10 the dress still fell to the floor.",3
417829,Not impressed at all! I finally receive it and the hoodie is not thick as it look in the picture. It does not have a string that goes through the hood. The logo is faded looking and just doesn't look like the actual North Face logo. The stitching of the pocket is not finished correctly. Not happy at all with it.,1
622184,"I love this bag!  It goes with everything. It is spacious,  has a lot of pockets inside, some outside,  zips at the top, is light, comfortable and has little silver  tabs on the bottom so the fabric never gets dirty when  you put it down. Ithe is perfect plus it's so affordable.",5
867691,I purchased this for my 7 year old daughter. She does not like how quickly the color fades after being charged by light. Both balls are very close in color unless charged. This was not made clear in the description. The blue color shown in this picture is not the color of the ball inside the locket unless charged by light and in the dark.,2
548299,"These glasses as you can plainly see, look like unisex glasses, and were advertised as rectangles. Well, they wernt exactly rectangles or purple, actually there lenses are so dark, you cant tell what color they are. and theres 2 big letters pasted on the front of the lens. Obviously womens glasses, after looking back on the sight, it said they were womens, so entirely my fault, just giving them to my girlfriend she said she likes them !!!!! :)",5
144536,"I bought these because I needed new earrings, but wasn't looking to spend big money. These get the job done! However, the backings are some cheap rubber backings that I needed to replace with metal backings so they would stay in my ear. These are good for the price and don't hurt my ears or turn green! Would buy again.",4
839881,"Kinda sad...I really wanted it to work but it just didn't. The item I received looked like it had been washed multiple times, threads were hanging out everywhere, and it was extremely short and looked like it should've been a crop top (I'm only 5'4 so I thought it would fit way better). Sadly it'll be returned.",1
332980,"Gorgeous dress.  Fits and compliments my body well.  Brings out all the curves.  I am (33-30-35), 107 lbs.  The dress fits perfectly with a small.  XS would be too small for me although I have to buy XS with some manufacturers.  My jeans size is also 0.",5
132524,"I ordered a small and recieved a medium. Shipping took awhile, which I didn't mind until I opened it up and saw it was the wrong size. It is HUGE and bulky looking on me...I'm concerned that even a small would be too large. Usually I am very happy with my orders from Amazon, but this time I am disappointed and sad. :(",1
274125,"I initially bought a different brand of ratchet belt, and found that I liked the concept so much that I wanted another.  I like this second one much better because the belt is released by pulling out on the buckle itself.  The release on my first belt is a small lever on the underside of the buckle.that I have to hunt for.",5
177818,"So even though all the reviews said these ran way too small I ordered an XL anyway because I loved these shorts. I weigh 130 and I'm about 5'3"". They fit my waist but they are extremely short and they don't really fit my butt at all. I plan on losing weight so I'm going to keep them in hopes I will eventually fit in them but if you're even somewhat thick I wouldn't waste your time.",3
282318,"Worst item I ever purchased from Amazon. Very disappointed. I am an 8  bought a large , not even close. Bought another X large still too small. Checked the US chart. Gave both away. Totally unable to call the oversees  number to return. I am out over $40.00. Buy lots from Amazon and always pleased with the item except this time.",1
650038,"My shirt came very fast! I was so excited to get it but once I did I was a little disappointed.  In the writing there is some white spots and on the bottom front of the shirt, it looks like glue? Its hard round stain. I don't have time to return it because I need to wear it in 2 days. Just pretty bummed.",4
172149,"I ordered the black with fiesta stitch.  The dress is not as pictured.  It shows an almost sheer skirt with a shorter lining, what I received is just cheap polyester jersey.  Also, it is not maxi length.  Im 55, I ordered a large.  It comes about mid calf.  While its too short, the bodice is way too big. Its just a strange fit, even though i ordered my standard size.  To be honest its not really wearable, Ill just use it as a swim cover up or something",1
213740,Some of the other posts said that XL was a good size for them. I found the tights to be too tight around my legs. By the time I pulled them up enough to fit in the crotch area the legging was around the middle of my calf. I'm a bit disappointed in the size but I also purchased some leg warmers. I can wear the two together. Then you can't tell how high up the leg the tight fits.,3
692162,"Amazing shirts! Great price and a great fit. I am 6'1"" & 228lbs, these shirts fit just as expected, nice & snug. I prefer to wear these shirts as a base layer under a more loose fitting work out shirt. This shirt in long enough to tuck into my shorts and does not rise up & out of my shorts during my work out.",5
62189,"I am 5 weeks post C Section.  I do like the C-Panty, although I wish it was a little tighter with holding me in around the belly area.  They are very comfortable and I do like the gel insert which goes over your scar area.  Overall I am happy with the purchase.",4
397500,"These are good quality as the waistband has three lines of stitching to the body of the shorts rather than the more usual two.  The grey elastic waistband streaches to about 140% of its normal size and although it isn't as wide (tall) as the one found on men's shorts, it is thicker.  The leg openings are reinforced with double stitching.  Your little boy will out grow these before he wears them out.",5
677236,"Very nice, and soft leather. the handles make it one of the most comfortable bags to carry. Its large enough to fit my NoteBook/Laptop, flat shoes, mail/work papers, water bottle, and sometimes my small messenger purses!
Bought it Sep 2016 and been using it daily, came back to buy a second one as a gift for my sister but unfortunately currently unavailable 
It's simply remarkable for the price!",5
330741,"It came big for a medium. Luckily I could easily alter it. I took in the sides and cut a few inches off the fringe. I wish the slip came down a little further but for the price you can't beat it!
Nice dress...excited to wear it for a christmas/gatsby costume!",4
447602,"As a bigger guy, I have always had trouble with belts.  These belts are awesome.  They don't break or bend and you can make them as tight or as loose as you want.  They are really comfortable.  This is highly recommended for any one who hates belts and needs to keep their pants up.",5
726431,"I love it and I would give it 5 stars, however, it is pretty short on the sleeves and the bottom. I'm keeping it because if I got any bigger than it would be too big on my stomach.
I really like it! I just expected it to be longer and a little thicker.
I will still wear it all the time though because I LOVE Gilmore girls and I LOVE coffee!",4
234244,reviews said this ran 2 sizes small son i ordered a size 4 for my 2 yr old that is 33pounds 35''.  she is just getting into a size 3 normally.  the size four was huge and fit as a 4 should fit.  i reordered the 2-3 size and its perfect still roomy and fit perfect after i washed and dried.  this looks so much like the mini bodes brand from nordstrom that runs like 50$ a dress.  i ordered 3 of these in different  patterns  very cute and quality great,5

I got it in the mocha rouge color combo and combined it with a comfy, brown leopard print lanyard that I found on etsy.com.  The only con about this ID case was that it's suggested selling price is $12 and it was priced at a dollar more... :/",5
647974,Very cute shirt and it is a thicker material but the white parts are still kinda see-thru. No tag on the shirt so can't tell a size. It fits a little small/tight but still cute. I am 40D and 160lbs and it fits tight. Should last awhile though based on the quality of the fabric. Bright colors and fun to wear. It did take a bit to arrive as it is coming from overseas. I received this at a discount for my honest unbiased review.,4
567575,couldn't wear it. The part that covers the breast is so unlike the picture as well as the sleeves. They were skinny and did not cover or hold up my girls what so ever. Also the material looks different in the picture. Very disappointed. The pictures cute but thats not the dress I got.,1
173255,"Kept getting compliments throughout the night. The dress fits as expected. If you are 12/14, then order a large. The neckline is a bit fitted, so it showed off my my attributes nicely. I wore out to tonight at a local restaurant that coincided a huge event the restaurant was hosting. I received lots of appreciative looks and a few patrons stopped to compliment me my dress. Definitely a favorite upgrade from the traditional little black dress.",5
539837,"This item was for my brother and he requested size medium, which when it came was some what tight and a bit short. It took over 2 weeks to arrive because it is from China, therefore i have ended up with the top myself.

96385,"Great hit at the party. Wore with a strapless bra, and be careful of your underwear. Had to try on a few so you couldn't see the elastic indents underneath the costume. I'm naturally a ginger so I just twisted my long hair into tiny twists. Everyone thought I was the best costume. Only part that made me feel weird was having my inner thighs exposed.",5
294686,"I like the fact that it fits my very small wrist.  I was able to wrap it around and plan to leave it on.  Haven't noticed any great health benefits yet, but I'm not any worse and it's still early days.  I received a compliment the first day I wore it to work.  My workmate thought it was rose gold.  It was very shiny initially, but I'm hoping it will dull somewhat.",5
143803,I love it! I moved from the hide and seek wallet from bellroy. For some reason my cards would get cracked from the old design... So I had to change it out. The new hide and seek looks to have walked that problem and add storage. For me in attempting to minimalize my habits. So far I love it! Most of the time I think I don't have a wallet.,5
396672,My little granddaughter loved the boots!  We bought them a little large at my dau's-in-law request but our little darling stomped around in them none the less on Christmas Eve.

Thank you!,5

I have worn it almost every day and especially like to wear it to Zumba class. I highly recommend it and the sellers are great. They refunded my money when the shipment took over a month, and I am now trying to pay them which they have so far, refused. A nice company and a nice product. I hope you will purchase from them.",5

382232,I am really pleased with the variety and packaging. There are so many different color options here! I like the fact that I can change these out often based on what I'm wearing. I'm going to see how these hold up over the next few months and leave more feedback.,4

Downfalls: I was not a fan of was the length of the shorts. They are more like capri length, but still super cute on the baby. It also runs big. My baby is 7 months old (17 pounds) and the 6-9 month was huge. I had to return and get 3-6 months. It fits much better.",4

This style that comes to a point over the forehead is more flattering than the ones that have one curve and fit lower.

Anyone could wear it, but it is ideal for chemo patients as it doesnt require any maintenance other than washing, goes on and off quickly, can be worn while sleeping for warmth, and is more comfortable and less expensive than a wig.

The buttons were falling off as I removed it from the package.  Those that were still on, were tangled up in the shirt and then fell off as I tried to untangle them.",2
436321,"The section under the top flap you lift up to nurse with bunches up and even spending some time trying to flatten it out doesn't help.  Their are weird elastic straps that I guess your supposed to use to pull the underneath together but they don't help.  I would return this if I could deal with the hassle.  Also, the body creeps up your waste and if you have longish arms like me this will seem somewhat short. I'm planning on wearing this under sweaters only.",1
662103,"Nope - colors were the same, dress fit. But the top portion was nothing like the picture. The neck part was almost to my collar bone and the armpit area when all the way up to my armpits to to the point it was way uncomfortable. The seller offered many different solutions and I took a partial refund thinking I could have it altered. But after looking into how much it would cost, it's not worth it. Save your money and buy this dress from the actual/original creators/company of this dress.",2
479198,"Belt is beautiful! I ordered an XL just to be safe. I shouldve ordered a L; next belt I will. I'm a size 10, curvy and I wear my jeans on my hips. Sometimes a size L is just a little bit too small, but now that I have an XL in this brand I know a L will do perfectly! Also, the shipping was way faster than expected. It came ab a week and a half early! Love it!!",5
322936,"Great costume for the price. Be sure the ankle cinches are tight or it won't inflate properly.  Another hint, use a steamer to get rid of all the wrinkles in the costume.  You could probably toss it in a dryer on low heat with a wet towel too, but be careful because it is just light weight polyester.",5
682545,I love this swim suit. I have ordered one every year of this brand and style (just different colors). It is very flattering for a large bust and has great support! the skirt is a good length as well and provides adequate coverage for large thighs. This is the first suit that I do not feel embarrassed to wear in public!,5
827207,"My husband usually wears an L/XL in most brands but as this was the only size available in prime, I purchased the XXL(2XL) and it fit him perfectly so I am assuming this hoodie runs small. It is very soft (almost terry cloth like) on the inside. Really great material and my husband loves it!",5
324232,"Good product for the price. It's a little off on the proportions (has a hard time closing just by using most of the slots) and the coin pouch is useless, but it holds tons of cards which is exactly what I was looking for. It's a good wallet and so far the quality is completely holding up. Four stars.",4
212591,"Super soft, great detailing!
The ears sit up quite nicely, and the hair isn't falling out (or easy to pull out, for that matter). It will be large on anyone younger than about 15, but older teens and adults it should fit perfectly (I'm 30, 5'2"", with a massive amount of hair). Even the mittens are a nice length (when I put them on, it doesn't attempt to pull the hood off my head).
HIGHLY recommended!",5
271785,"I have had a hard time wearing earrings my entire life. I always had swollen sore lobes the day after wearing anything. Sterling silver, gold, it all really bothered me. These earrings are a dream. No reaction what-so-ever. The posts are a little thicker than normal, but they went in very easily. The balls screw on wonderfully and feel very secure, bonus: they are comfortable to sleep in as well. I am VERY happy with this purchase.",5
269420,"Perfect size!  This one is actually functional.  I was using similar design in smaller size and became very frustrated with it.  Only negative, if all slots are filled with credit cards, it is too tight.  I use every other one and it closes fine.  Nice to have bright colors to locate easily in a handbag!  I'd buy it again.",4
399991,"I ordered this great Item and what I got was a Item that was a bright ""PINK"".  This does not work for me as I am a guy going on vacation from Iraq.  I was going to were this to go see a girlfriend that is into Butterflies... she is not into men dressed in bright pink little girl looking things.  I advise everyone not to buy anything from this seller.",1
844153,"The color was as shown in the picture. Material was of good quality (compared to the price) and was well made. My only concern is that I ordered a size 4 (which is what i usually buy in store) and it was much larger, size 2 would have been proper fit for me. I read comments below saying it is too small but I think either they are wrongly labeling the sizes as mine was larger than my regular size.",4
849858,"Just received my bikini in the mail! It's just perfect! I'm in love. I prefer a bit more coverage in my tops than what a little triangle bikini offers. I'm 5'4"" 150lbs and I wear a 38C bra. I ordered the medium and it fits perfect. I also don't really care for underwire but it doesn't bug me at all with this suit!",5
646735,"I don't know what happened to this brand. The ones we bought last year that said ""Made In Bangladesh"" were good pajamas. These are the same brand but say ""Made in Pakistan"" and are not the same quality. These were covered in loose threads, with puckered seams, about to rip. The bag said size Medium but inside were size Extra Large. The cardboard inside was a German frozen pizza box!  Returning.",1
827457,"These say 20 gauge, but they've got to be at least 18. I know nose hoops are notoriously difficult to get in, but once I got one in, the piercing started bleeding, and took several days to heal again afterward. They're too big for my nose anyway-- it looked ridiculous once I got it in.",2
128642,"I saw this in a store and tried it on, but was reluctant to pay the price.  I got it for about half of the store price on Amazon and it arrived promptly.  It fits nicely; I wore it on a windy day and it did serve as a nice windbreaker.  I am very pleased with the purchase.",5
711241,"These are adorable and perfect for a little girl dinosaur lover! They fit a little short, but big in the body. If you have a short but chubby child perfect. If you baby is long and thin, order up a size for length but expect them to be a little baggy in the tummy area.",5
576995,"I'm kind of afraid to wash it because it is pretty small.  I'm a 34C bust and the shirt fits me just right, but it may shrink in the wash.  Should have ordered a medium, but that's not the shirt's fault.  Great shirt with an important message. LoL",4
405550,"I've seen quite a few scapulars in my day and this one stands for the specific reason that it *really cannot be seen if one wears it properly.*  It is a wide, regular cord, and neither of the beautiful, threaded icons (one of St. Michael in a deeper green than the photograph suggests) and another with the papal crown on the other.  I was so pleased with these I ordered three, one for me, a friend, and a relative.  Recommended, particularly for those who have a special adoration for St. Michael.",5
79113,These are beautiful and come in a variety of colors. I had to have navy to go with my jeans. I normally wear a 9 1/2 - 10 depending on the shoe. I needed a 10 for this shoe. First day I wore them I received compliments. They were comfortable even with the platform wedge. Great price as well.,5
221009,"This portfolio is super soft and helps with my level of organization. I love that the gray is a little different than the traditional black and the pad that it comes with. The interior file space is not very roomy and I honestly don't use it, but it's nice to have a place to put a few business cards and a pen.",4
784888,"Bought this hat at a 7 1/4 thinking it would fit, as from another seller my 7 1/8 was way way to big.
So naturally thinking the size down would be perfect, it wasn't.
Contacted the seller, responded quickly and I was more than satisfied with his response.

Bought the same hat from this seller next size up 7 1/8 and fits perfect!
No need for shrinking or stuffing the liner.

Will be back for future purchases.",5
803862,"I just received the dress & it's really long. I'm 4'8 and I was expecting it to be long but that's nothing atlerations can't fix. Because I'm small, the top fits a little big as well. (I got the shoulders taken in to solve that) This is a gorgeous dress & I'm ready to slay '",4
150405,"I purchased this tie for my husband's Fathers Day present.  He is quite picky about his ties, and if they are too short, he hates it!  This is a beautiful blue silk tie that is the perfect length for him.  He looks very good in it, and you can tell he feels good in it as well.  I'm so glad that I've found this product, and I will continue to buy from them, no problem.",5
436361,I was so excited about the necklace. It is beautifully made. The reverse side is an insult though. I didn't know it said that on the back. Be sure to look on the back of these necklaces. I was going to give this to my Boss. Thank goodness I read the back!!! Too bad the necklace is quality made just the back saying all  wrong,1
596204,"It too almost two months to receive and when I finally got it, it was POORLY constructed. The straps were falling off from the seems, one of the straps was super loose and long as if the manufacturer just grabbed whatever piece of cloth he/she could find and poorly sewn it on, it was extremely tight in the chest-- and I have small boobs-- and it had some type of chemical on it that irritated my skin. Based on my experience, I wouldn't suggested this swimsuit/vendor but everyone has their own person experiences that can differ.",1
63214,"This was actually better than expected! I am a size 16 5'5"" and the large fit great except it was a little big in the bust area. The material is thick enough on top that I can wear it without a bra and it still looks fine. The only thing is the boot covers like I read on here they don't stay up and I will probably just not wear them. I think they will get the picture without them. Overall worth the price I think. (Got it for a superhero themed 30th)",4
149922,"Love these.  A bit more expensive than the cheap nylon ones but worthwhile.  Stretchy fabric allows for my size 10's very nicely.  One shoe per sleeve, since you don't want your shoes rubbing against each other anyway.  Bought one pair, liked them so much, purchased a 2nd pair.",5
197791,"I have been looking for the perfect triangl match and this is by far the closest. I am a 36d /dd 5'5 and 145lbs. The extra large fits my top perfectly, the bottoms are slightly too big but you can't tell that much at all. I have no butt either so I would be cautious if you have a bigger but. But overall great bathing suit epically for the price, this will be the best dupe you can find I promise.",4
644734,"Much too small.  Asian sizes are just too small for the American market, no matter how many ""Xs"" they add to the size.  I bought a 4XL and they fit my daughter, an American size 10.  I'm vowing to stop trying no matter how much I like the styles!",1
32479,"What this really is a oversize sock with a pocket to hold a hand warmer placed on top of the toes.  The pocket is too small and is placed in an  awkward spot it's a balancing act to keep the hand warmer in place and the sock is not snug to the foot,  I don't recommend this product.  What does work instead is wool socks and HotHand foot warmers.",1
620718,I'm a size 5...5'5 125lbs  and a medium did not fit. They were too small... Even if I forced them to fit they are super low rise. After taking two steps my butt crack started showing. Not sure why anybody would make workout pants that are low rise since you're moving the entire time in them. So these are completely unwearable.,2
308855,"Now, this is a middle man review, because these were for my sister, but she let me know what she thought of them. First off, they all were sized correctly. The colors are good, and they feel and look like real stone. However, there was an imperfection in one of the plugs. All in all, it wasn't a bad purchase for what I paid. I'm sure they're not all like the one I got, and one knick out of six plugs isn't bad.",4
362832,"I really like this dress/tunic. It looks exactly as pictured. As the other reviews state, it is a little short; if you have any kind of height, I would recommend sizing down and wearing it as a tunic with leggings. Also, be aware that it is a little loose. It does not have a fitted appearance at all, so sizing down would be advantageous in that respect as well. But for the price, I really like it!",4
779316,"I love the print so so much. It came out gorgeous as I expected. The only issues I have with the shirt itself is its too short for my body type, I have a long torso and short legs and it didn't hug my body like I thought and the armpits are large. But over all I still wear it and really enjoy it! And I love the material!",3

Anyhow, my foot was in constant pain and my doctor (G.P.) recommended these for some relief.  They've done so well that I ordered another set for shoes that I wear regularly.  The only downside it that they use up a significant amount of depth within the shoe.",5

763514,the lace flapping under your armpits is weird. and the lace on the chest doesn't lay down well. the arms are also kinda snug and don't drop around the wrist as it does int he picture. maybe i would've needed to buy a bigger size for that effect....which no doubt would have made the lace on the chest even more loose.,2
794893,Not only was this hoodie like a children's size (we ended up letting our 8 year old nephew wear it - size XL) but it was the worst quality. Someone cut out the iron on by hand. They didn't even cut the acura letters out. It was so amateur and bad. I HIGHLY recommend buying something else. It was terrible.,1
321637,"The round parts of the conversion pendants are too bulky to hide and tend to make the pin/pendant protrude in an unnatural and crooked kind of way.  I will try again with another pin but I doubt that it will be better.  Unless the pin is large and clunky, it would be hard to hide these things.  I think that if you have very large pins, these might work but I'm not happy with them at all!!",2
350588,"Received these glasses promptly and was very happy with the quality. They are just as pictured and very comfortable. I love that the nose ""pads"" are just plastic so they don't get caught in my hair when I slide my glasses up.
I have received many compliments and love the price point of these as I don't have to worry too much about them.
They fit comfortably on my head, but tight enough that they don't slide down or move around too much.",5

I am always leery of ordering products that have not yet been reviewed but I decided to buy these anyway.  Let me first say, DO NOT BUY! They are terrible quality and material.  The material is extremely thin and see through.  They are WAY TOO EXPENSIVE FOR WHAT YOU GET.",1

very pretty, though.",2

874698,Decent underwear that does not ride up. I purchased some in a local store and went online to purchase additional pairs with the same product name. It turns our they were slightly different than the purchase I made in the store. The band is thicker (though still a smooth fit) and the cotton content is higher (80%) which means they are less effective with moisture wicking.,3

I would love to see some different models with other features like a slot for business cards, maybe option to have your name, message, design engraved on the cover.  Maybe some inserts to add more slots.  Very great product, and very friendly people who follow up to make sure you are satisfied.",5
582396,I just love love love LOVE these gloves!!!! There super cute and soft and I have gotten a lot of compliments on them!! Everyone that sees them asks me where I got them! Great buy! There sturdy and well sown and look just like the picture. Only problem I have is when my fingers swell the gloves get stuck around my fingers but that is not the designers fault. Other then that 5 stars paws down! ^.^,5

I passed them on to my stringbean boyfriend who is 56 and 117lbs.  They are tight in him as well, which is a first, but the rise would still accommodate a buttcrack that extended up to his armpits.

Slenderman, if you're out there, these sweats are for you.",1
519451,Entirely too small.  I purchased one for me and one for my daughter.  They both were too small.  This dress is cut in a much smaller size than you would think.  The fabric is not quality.  We could not try them on because we could not get in them.,2

I had previous tap shoes so I had a good idea of which size to buy. They fit like a charm. It is a great show and my daughter's dance studio has used this brand for years. A better sizing chart would be helpful for those who do not have previous shoes to help them gauge the size.,5

The straps were so long, they reached midway down my back, and underneath the arm holes/bust it was stretched out and billowing.
